So I absolutely disagree with you that they should close their stores and be online only. The big advantage these stores have over amazon is that they have physical stores in addition to an online one.\\n\\nOn top of that some of the in-demand electronics that gamestop sells such as new gen consoles like the ps5 are bought up in seconds by bots/scalpers to be re sold for an insane profit margin. Same thing happens to new graphics card which gamestop also now sells. These type of items should be pick up only to circumvent bullshit like that. \\n\\nPeople like you who just assume that gamestop is worthless because it has similarities to blockbuster are the reason that a lot of us are making money and why the stock price is soaring. Gamestop is not blockbuster. Gamestop has tremendous value.\\n\\n Also, side note, hard copy video games are 100% worth more than digital download versions based on the fact that you can resell your hard copies and you don't have to wait 5 hours for it to download before playing.

I am sure they also realize the impacts this situation could potentially do to the entire US market.\\n\\nSo... I gotta wonder... if it is in a foreign power's interest for the US markets to go down and bolster themselves in the global markets/strengthen their currency or whatever... would they ALSO GME DIAMOND HAND? hmmmm......\\n\\nI think it would be CRAZY if, say, China's central government decides it is a worthy economic move to transfer millions/billions to someone and find a way to drive the squeeze.

Count me as one. \\n\\nI’ve been admiring this battle from the sidelines until I bought my one share of GME yesterday, because I feel called to this movement.\\n\\nIn any uprising, what scares the system most is the breaking of unwritten rules. Decorum. Accepted best practice. \\n\\nWhat won the colonies the Revolutionary War was a departure from “previously agreed upon wartime tactics.” The British lined up their regiments and marched into battle in tightly-knit rows while the colonial army picked them off from the trees. The British complained that the uncouth manner in which the disrespectful colonial scum were fighting made it difficult for them to be victorious.\\n\\nYou scare the system because you don’t play by it’s rules. You are being viewed as a terrorist cell because profiting is secondary or tertiary to exacting a form of moral revenge. The wink and the nod between Ive League-educated, sixth-generation wealth is that the field of battle is “out there,” and enriching oneself is the primary objective with a secondary goal of maintaining a status quo that keeps them in power. “Let’s be gentlemen about this.”\\n\\nHaving diamond hands that refuse to budge scares the ever-loving shit out of Remington and Blain, brothers from New Canaan who have been raised to believe in a code of the (wall) streets. “It’ll get nasty but we never turn on each other” even as the new wealth and less-WASPy cretins get involved. You still invite them to your parties and country clubs (some), more so you can keep your eye on them. Those who want in. Those who aspire to “society.”\\n\\nBut not this sub. “Fuck your society rules. Fuck your country club.” Like the British with their bayonets and crisp red collars, these elites are caught flat-footed. They can’t believe the AUDACITY. “A few charlatans are leading the majority of those participating astray, that must be it!” They can’t understand that we (yes me too) might hold on to these shares until they burn our hands, to make a point. “Those poor retail investors don’t understand what they are doing.”\\n\\nThat’s not it, Blain. This is a revolution you privileged piece of shit. Some people have more guiding them than social norms. And get used to it, because this isn’t going away. No, this is just the start.\\n\\nIn the end, we can have our cake and eat it too. Knowing how to time this so we still have capital to invest in the next thing just makes sense. You don’t waste all your bullets in the first battle - not when there is a war to win.\\n\\n💎💎💎🚀🚀🚀🙈🙉🙊',\n",

But they report widely different numbers, Ortex for example reports that most have covered, whereas others show short rates of like 200%. I obviously don’t know which one is more accurate.\\n\\nAs for covering not being possible in this timeframe, I personally don’t think that’s true. You read “days to cover: 6 days” on some websites for example. But that kind of data is based on the average volume of shares that is traded. Before all this happened a lot less shares were being traded daily, so it would also be harder to cover. However, the past 10 day average of shares that traded hands is something like 100M shares a day on average. The total float of shares is like 50M, so with current volumes I think it would be possible to cover way faster then these websites report.\\n\\nIn reality, these hedge funds aren’t stupid. They probably began to cover their asses when the stock climbed up from 20$ to 40$ for example. Melvin will definitely take or has already taken a huge billion dollar hit on this. Also, the majority of GME shares is also owned by institutions (blackrock and vanguard as far as I know). Imagine you have been holding shares since they were 10$, these companies are probably also selling shares now that the price is 300$ to make some profit for their investors. \\n\\nTime will tell.

Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.\\n\\n2. After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims / good guys.\\n\\n3. Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.\\n\\n4. Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.\\n\\n5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.\\n\\n6. If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.\\n\\n7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Also, DO NOT transfer to your bank, because that will trigger a tax event. You're supposed to transfer between brokers. Look into this further yourself, since I'm not a tax expert.\\n\\n8. If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. Google will lose hundreds or thousands of dollars per year from your ad revenue and data collection.\\n\\n9. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand REAL consequences for this criminal behavior. This matters.\\n\\nYou're welcome to exchange this info freely if you find it useful. I am not a financial advisor, yadda yadda, you know the drill.\",\n",

After ten green bars you start to worry. “Diamond Hands” you tell yourself, but your getting anxious. You try not to look at the rising price, and consider locking your phone, but that only makes your stomach ache. The short squeeze accelerates. It’s been three minutes. Money begins to physically pour out of your phone. Your bathroom floor is covered in a thin layer of $100 bills. You try to shovel it into the tub but it builds up too fast. You lock the bathroom door to prevent the cash from escaping. The air grows thin, rapidly displaced by the impossible flow of cash. The short squeeze accelerates. You slip and fall in the anomalous stream of bills, pouring from your phone. The cash is now six inches deep, and you struggle to put down your phone, but alas, you hands have solidified into perfect diamonds. The short squeeze accelerates. You struggle to stand as the force of the cash rapidly exiting your phone, stuck in your hand and impossible to put down, begins to propel you backwards as if you were on a money printer themed slip-and-slide. Still on your knees, the cash is now at chin height. To avoid drowning you open the bathroom door. The deluge of greenbacks reminds you of the Great Molasses Flood of 1919, only with money instead of molasses. The short squeeze accelerates. It’s been ten minutes. Your children and wife scream in rapture as their bodies are engulfed by the freshly minted freedom bucks. Your youngest child goes under, with equal parts delight and horror, and muffled cries rising from the churning cash pool. You pray to DeepFuckingValue to finally sell, so you can follow suit. The short squeeze accelerates. You squeeze your eyes shut to stop the eldritch sight of so much money pouring from your phone, but it does not care if you witness it. It can not be contained. The force of the money propels you with such force you feel a sense of weightlessness as you accelerate off the ground. Your body picks up speed as it slides backwards along the uncrumpled bills. You smash through the wall, hurtling into the sky at thirty miles an hour. From a bird’s eye view you see your house is completely buried in money. Your neighbor calls the SEC. The short squeeze accelerates. As you continue to ascend, you spot police cars racing towards your house. The cops pull out their guns and take aim, but stray bundles of money hit them in the eyes, blinding them. The short squeeze accelerates. You are now at an altitude of 1000 feet. The SWAT team arrives. Military helicopters circle you. The billionaire class has ordered your execution, and hundreds of guns fire on you, yet you remain unharmed, being forged from diamonds. The short squeeze accelerates. It has been two hours. With your ape-like body now entirely composed of Diamond, the money begins to spray as if directed by a rocket nozzle. You break the sound barrier. The government, pressured by WallStreet, deploys fighter jets to chase you down, but the impact of your cash flow sends one plane crashing to the ground. The government decides to let you leave the Earth. You feel your lungs start to burn, as you reach the edges of the atmosphere. You narrowly miss the ISS, giving it a new green paint job as you fly past. Physicists and economists struggle to calculate your erratic trajectory. The short squeeze accelerates. The money begins to gravitate towards itself, forming a comet trail of cash. Astronomers begin calling you the “GME Rocket.” You are lost in space, heading roughly in the direction of Andromeda. You wonder, briefly, if perhaps you should hit the Sell button. A small voice in the back of your shattered mind whispers...\\n\\n”Hold.”',\n",

It's out of control,       now - there are too many people involved. There are other institutions involved, trying to extract maximum profit       out of the shorts. The meme has reached critical mass.     \\n\\nNow it's a classic million-player prisoner's dilemma: every GME holder has visions of selling their shares for       unlimited chicken tendies and cocaine dipping sauce. Maybe they think they alone can sell, while everyone else can       continue to drive the price up by holding. But if every degenerate gambler thought this way, and sold their       shares, very quickly the short squeeze wouldn't happen. Short holders would buy up all the shares being sold at a       painful but manageable loss, they would cover their position, and the nuke would never be detonated.     \\n\\nWhat's a prisoner in this dilemma to do? At last, the point arrives. To avoid selling too early, the savvy       degenerate gambler would wait until short interest - the amount of shares shorted out there - started to decline       substantially. As long as nobody was defecting, nobody selling early, that decline in shares shorted would come       with a spike in the price of the stock, as the few shares available are bought at astronomical prices. And this       decline in shares shorted would distinguish this spike from gamma squeezes or regular old stock run-ups.     \\n\\nThen and only then, as the nuke goes off, the stock price ascends past Alpha Centauri, and the short interest       finally starts declining, the short squeeze has begun. And then it's every gambler for themself.     \\n\\nNot financial advice - sir this is a gamestop\",\n",

Look up how easy it was for Buffett to manipulate the silver market back in the 90's and he made a killing of that, this isn't as far out of reach as it may seem. If they can do it why can't we?

Sooner of later these stocks will trade at valuations that will reflect their future earnings.

Only approx 10-12 million shares have ever traded above $328 and not all of those transactions involved initiating a short.\\n\\nThe current short float is about 60 million shares. So you can assume that there are currently over 50 million shares that were shorted and are currently in the red.\\n\\nIf the stock keeps rising (without major drops) those 50 million shorted shares that are currently losing money will need to be liquidated. They can hold them forever, but it's very expensive to hold a short in GME. There are high margin requirements, interest rates are jacked up and there is a high fee to borrow the stock.\\n\\nAt one point, one of the larger short position holders will come to the realization that they cant win and will liquidate before the stock price jumps further and that will start the squeeze.\\n\\nHope this helps\\n\\nUpdate : 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\\nUpdate 2 : Not financial advice.\",\n",

This is not about profits as you have made very clear in many posts and comments as I lurked here over the past few days. This is about sending a message.\\n\\nI am writing out my predictions only to see if retards think like I do and maybe spark how to counter what I think might be coming. I know many are skeered of new users swaying holds and pushing to sell... that is not me. I just want to be sure I (and thus you) understand what is going to happen this week. \\n\\nFull disclosure. No shares in GME. Phone is too old to host a trading app. No trading or financial experience or training/education. 100% retard. I am taking what you retards have been talking/teaching me about and this situation and this is my summation and predictions. \\n\\nGME is still over shorted. How much, new higher price point for shorts, no one knows but the short is on and the squeeze has yet to happen.\\n\\nWhat will they do?\\n\\nNo bullets? They have Fed Reserve BRRRR potentially. Just saying, it is possible.\\n\\nSteal your shares outright? Impossible you say? Just take them and force on you a \"sell price\" that \"protects\" the retail investor from \"market volatility?\" They have done this already am I not correct? Margin or not, if they are THAT DESPERATE, they might do it. Just take ALL your shares and give you peanuts for them because they can to make an example out of you. Probability of this path? Unless Wall Street and DC (Yellen/Biden/Pelosi) want a literal \"Let them eat cake moment.\"... they SHOULD be scared of this option considering the state of the country after that other Blond Business Guy just left the White House. Low probability, but again, not zero. How to counter? Screen shot, screen shot, screen shot and spread the blatant STEAL of GME shares to the whole world.\\n\\nGet Gamestop to issue more shares? It could happen, but at what price? If they issue enough and give direct access to buy to the 🌈🐻\\'s by blocking/limiting your buys, this would be the cleanest exit for them. But is it? How many shares do they need? Will Gamestop PLAY THE WALL STREET GAME after being rescued by you retards? I honestly don\\'t know if this will happen, but if others can refute it, chime in.\\n\\nMost probable?\\n\\nThey will ladder/hammer the price down slowly and win via attrition. Rolling their shorts into ever higher price points until they can reach an intraday swing they can actually FORCE on the price in order to actually exit 100% and still profit in their shorts. They control this. Going to Gamestop to ask for shares is both lowering themselves and admitting they are screwed, one reason they won\\'t. The hammer/ladder attrition war allows them to save face and still try to stick it to retail. If we know those retards on Wall Street, this is as much about being the alpha in the market as it is profits. As long as they (or their backers) are willing to back MASSIVE LOSSES to slowly get out of their short positions into higher price points over time (a week? a month?), we will see more of the HFT takedowns we saw last Thursday. Was Friday\\'s market losses hedge funds scraping the market for one more clip of bullets? I know, cost of carrying the debt, it IS astronomical.... but is it a price they are willing to PAY to prevent you winning? Refutation. They would still need to buy shares to exit shorts 100%. Where will they come from? You retards. You hold, no matter how flat the price is or if they roll over to ever higher exit price points, if you hold AND keep adding (even one or two shares) on the dips, keeping the 🚀🚀🚀🚀 pressure on the price... how long before the pain of covering their short position carry costs will simply be too much without direct Fed Reserve BRRRR money printing to save the entire market?\\n\\nThat\\'s it.

GameStop shares that have been borrowed and sold short have declined by just about 5 million over the last week, marking an 8% dip in the short interest, according to S3. Most of the short covering occurred on Thursday, when the stock fell for the first time in six days.\\n\\n“I keep hearing that ‘most of the GME shorts have covered’ — totally untrue,” said Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3 managing director of predictive analytics. “In actuality the data shows that total net shares shorted hasn’t moved all that much.”\\n\\n“While the ‘value shorts’ that were in GME earlier have been squeezed, most of the borrowed shares that were returned on the back of the buy to covers were shorted by new momentum shorts in the name,” Dusaniwsky added in an email.\\n\\nShares of GameStop, along with other heavily shorted stocks, spiked once again Friday, after Robinhood said it was resuming limited trading of previously restricted securities. The gain pushed GameStop’s rally this week to over 400% and this month to more than 1,600%.\\n\\n\\nThe video game stock has been the star of the show on the WallStreetBets Reddit forum, whose membership has grown rapidly to over 5 million. A wave of day traders continued to encourage each other to pile into GameStop’s shares and call options, creating a massive short squeeze that inflicted pain for hedge funds betting against the stock.\\n\\nThe borrow fee on GameStop’s stock — or the cost-to-borrow shares for the purpose of selling them short — jumped to 29.32% on existing shorts and 50% on new short positions, S3 said.\\n\\n“If most of the shorts had covered, we would not be seeing stock borrow rates at these high levels — by now you would be able to borrow GME stock at single digit levels due to an increase in the lendable stock loan supply due to borrowed shares being returned after all the ‘supposed’ buy-to-covers,” Dusaniwsky said.\\n\\nGameStop remained the most-shorted name in the market as short interest as a percentage of shares available for trading stands at 113.31%, S3 said.',\n",

The melv-p72-ctdl (MPC) lot suffered crit dmg but short vol. hasn't changed AT ALL. MPC most surely are back with a vengeance but now possibly with EVEN MORE friends, turn after turn waiting to stick it in ur ass. Because they think they know it will end sometime somehow, just depends on who's the lucky ones to jam it in and reap. Gangbangin' shorts could even be spread thinly across different players so as to avoid a vital hit like previously endured by MPC.\\n\\n2. Every media's coverage...every 'expert's opinion' is betting that this will end badly for the last holders. This may yet be true.... BUT to prove them wrong we'll need more than bravery.....\\n\\n3. I've Dr Stranged this across the multiverses and so far the only scenario, the only path to glourious victory, is to re-distribute across large swathes of the GLOBAL population coming onboard, each owning a small piece of GME like a medal. No more sale. nada. Held as a symbol of the revolution forever and ever, spoken of for generations to come.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMY FUCKING SHITTY BRAINFART\\n\\nSince valentine's on the horizon, heck ima call it #SharingTheGLove -\\n\\n\\\\&gt;&gt;&gt; heroes need to spend February GRADUALLY sharing their love with new reinforcements across the entire month. reinforcements have arrived but they need gear at affordable rates!!!!! BUT slow fucking gradual reduction dammit (e.g. 5-10% per week, say... 0.5-1% per day. Eventually reduce by 20-50% overall, your choice) and at the same time start moving your available liquidity into the next Frontier ready for multi-teabags again. Or buy your baby some cheese and shit..\\n\\n\\\\&gt;&gt;&gt; No shame in calling for backup when fighting the level boss. Idea is to allow re-distribution to reinforcements across the broader human population who's coming onboard to buy and hold!!!!! Eventually NONE OF US WILL EVER NEED TO SELL.\\n\\n\\\\&gt;&gt;&gt;Also if you were to THEORETICALLY lose all of your remaining holdings as the news predicts, the next Frontier should allow you to cover any loses and more.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMost definitely I'm a blithering moron who shouldn't be advising anyone on anything ever, thats why I'd love to be schooled on why this would be a terrible pile of crap.\",\n",
