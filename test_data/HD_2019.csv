The MacBook does have discrete graphics and the 6-core i7 model as opposed to the 4-core one, but the price still isn't justified. Here's a faster equivalent MacBook Pro (with a GTX 1060 and the same 6-core processor) for $1,100 less:

1,2019-03-04,"5G is poised to radically change how people and devices connect. Its high capacity (20Gb per second peak data rates), low latency (&lt;1 millisecond), and massive connectivity implications (1mn connections per Km2) will not only deliver ultra-broadband services, like HD and ultra-HD video streaming, but also enable cellular to enter the world of autonomous vehicles, industrial sensors, and IoT devices.

&amp;#x200B;

Fifth-generation or 5G will be the next major iteration of the mobile industry’s technology evolution that started in the 1980s with 1G (voice-on ly). Every ge neration (2G, 3G, 4G/LTE) has boosted the download speeds on mobile devices enabling new data services. The last major transition from 3G to 4G kicked-off in 2008, su pport ingdownload speeds of \~1 Gigabit/second (Gb/s) in stationary and 100 Megabits/second (Mb/s) when the subscriber is mobile. 5G promises to provide a 10x+ jump, with peak download speeds over 10 Gb/s and mobile speeds exceeding 1 Gb/s. We expect very modest 5G smartphone sales in 2019, but believe the potential launch of a 5G iPhone in 2020 to be the incentive needed to jump-start this market. The ongoing tech-race between US, China could be an added catalyst.

0,2019-09-04,"You can beat the market you just need enough bullets (liquid) to keep firing when playing options.

Problem is Hedge funds have a truck ton of bullets.

I go on a 4-5 miss streak on doubling down I’m fucked.

Case in point I played earnings this summer. Small play on ROKU puts....lost

Doubled down on HD puts.... lost

Quadrupled down on TGT calls... backed up the brinks truck. And I’m positive 6K even after taking those 2 losses in a row.

Hit big on TGT and then reverted back to a smaller investment on CRM earnings and got a decent return.

I’m essentially applying the Martingale betting system to earnings and its paying off. Just keep doubling down, I’ve never been a lucky person when it comes to gambling but do your research and honestly just hitting 1/3 big earnings events will beat the market average in my opinion.

Don’t make plays just to make them. Look for big events like earnings, and flip a coin. Just hope you don’t lose 5 in a row.

Here’s a freebie September 17th play SPY puts I don’t think the fed cuts rates or at worst .25BPS. Market is pricing in .5 or better. You’ll see a nice 2% drop after the meeting.
