1,2020-01-01,"Obviously common equity is last in line. As of August of 2019 GME had $424mm of cash and equivalents, $122mm of receivables, $950mm of inventory and about $140mm of prepaid expenses. Add in $1B of real estate and $2.2B of liabilities and you're left with about $810mm of equity or around $9/sh in tangible equity. 

Obviously, cash and equivalents can be assumed at full carrying value, as can the prepaid expenses since it's a safe assumption that the business would not be in an overnight fire sale and have some operations before liquidating. Receivables can probably be sold off quickly at 80¬¢ or so on the dollar. This puts discounted current assets excluding inventory at $661mm. 

Real estate is carried at $1B and is seen as fairly desirable. It's fair to assume it can be liquidated at somewhere above 75¬¢ on the dollar, or $750-$800mm. 

Before inventory, our discounted assets are now $1.4B against $2.2B of liabilities. Inventory now just needs to be sold off at above 80¬¢ on the dollar to break even on equity, which is a little high but not impossible since they're mostly used games and therefore carrying value is already steeply discounted. 

I believe the brand has some value left, and the operating business could be sold off or run for a few more years for some extra profits. At easily over $4-5B in sales and a 33% gross margin, any credible investment banker could fetch a valuation of the equity in the mid-hundred millions if not much higher. GME could very easily be liquidated or acquired for around where shares trade today, especially given the recent EBITDA breakeven. 

Cost cutting, if done by a competent manager, could result in annual EBITDA in excess of $150-200mm. This gives a pretty favorable EV/EBITDA for an acquirer when I bought -- roughly 7-10x. That shouldn't be difficult to find a buyer for.",hsauers,wallstreetbets,1.0

What happens when they use half their cash to pay down debt and the rest of the debt gets refinanced to a few years from now (which is, IMHO, a guarantee)? Don't get me wrong: I believe GME will die eventually. But over the next 2 years, especially when game consoles come out?

even if they go complete tits up your maximum loss is going to be $200 per option after the premiums, and looking at gamestops current books their position actually ain't as bad as people make it out to be. lots of value to be unlocked if an activist investor swoops in and divies up the company.

also the next console cycle will definitely bring in extra cash, even if it is going to hurt it in the long term, in the short term it will provide gamestop with some much needed cash infusions.

SPY 210 5/15

The bounce fucked me up the ass but I still feel good. IV, however, is a bitch. I'll need it to be below 200 to really make any money. Not feeling great, but not terrible either.

I also have some LYFY, UBER, GME and HOG, most of which are for june/july/august timelines. When earnings hit for these companies, it's gonna be a blood bath.

SO yeah, FDs are stupid. Market gonna drop, you can still try for HRs wwith longer out dates...",GleBaeCaughtMeSlipin,wallstreetbets,1.0
2,2020-04-04,"is this a serious questions?!? Firstly, stop FDing. Between the IV and theta and all the other shit that makes up the 'juice' on an option, you are paying massive premiums. Such is the nature of trading during volatile times.

I'll give you an example. SPorts gambling. You generally bet 110 bucks to win a100. The $10 is juice, so 10%. That's damn high. That means that if you bet a 1000 games over the next year, and win 500 and lose 500, you actually ended up losing $500 bucks. And most sports gamblers can't bat higher than .500. House is built to win, get it?

&amp;#x200B;

Now think about options in volatile times. You are often spending 160 bucks to win a100. It's not an apples to apples analogy, but essentially the same shit. Based on IV and all the other shit, you are paying a 'premium' just to make that bet. Now again, most options gamblers will bat around .500. So you make a 1000 of these options at $160 to win a $100, and you you win half and lose half, you are essentially losing $3000 bucks. 

Now options are different from sports betting in that its not 1 or 0. You can hit a homerun and win 10x, but that's gonna be so rare. More often than not yuou're gonna lose that option for 0.

Long story short, pure gambling in the options market is full retard. Full stop. You have far better odds doing all sorts of other gambling. GO play blackjack, bet on sports, anything. To answer your question, either own stocks, or longer term options. I'm right now sitting on puts on teh SPY and a few companies that are either going to struggle mightily to get past this madness that is this pandemic, or will straight up go under. And even then I'm paying massive premiums for the puts.

Yes, 95% of their stores are were net profitable. But, that was before the virus. Their business relies on sales volume. Cut out what I have estimated at 95% of their overall business (brick and mortar sales) and they are finished (I have estimated based on their search traffic that their total online sales are roughly $300 million annually - less than 5% of their total sales...FYI their search volume has not increased since the virus started, it's something I track daily...perhaps their online conversion rates have increased but definitely not by 1,500%, not even close, that's just not how online conversions work). Maybe they are not completely finished yet because they have over $600 million in cash and $420 million in debt, which they can clearly cover.

As far as spy 300c, maybe man. Who knows, however, if you look at the last 2 historic US dollar short squeezes starting from 1971, each cycle of strength resulted in massive financial crisis and recessions. None of the previous 2 short squeezes included a global shutdown of trade/economies. Also dollar short squeeze the US was considerably more leveraged, and had more foreign US dollar denominated debts.

 As I mentioned it was 2.3 trillion in 2000s, now its 12.3 trillion which is an increase from 23% of our GDP / 50% of US broad money supply to 56% of US GDP and 78% of US broad money supply. 

My long term outlook is more bearish, basing my mindset off previous dollar squeezes where the US was more insulated, I think even if the virus was vaccinated tomorrow and became a distant memory we are still going to be  wading thru some troubling waters, even with Jpow at the printer.",shit-fire,wallstreetbets,5.0
6,2020-04-11,"So ...Spy 300C?

Also, your gme puts are fooked",AlwaysBlamesCanada,wallstreetbets,6.0
7,2020-04-11,"I'd encourage you to do some research on the USD with respect to major market events. In the 2000s there was around 2.3$ trillion in dollar denominated debts held by foreign nations/institutions/investors. 

In 2019 q3 there was $12.1 trillion in dollar denominated debts held by foreign nations/instutions/investors.

It should be no surprise to you that the USD is the global reserve currency, but there is literally not enough dollars in the system to support the demand at the moment. I believe this is one reason the FED and Jpow are acting so aggressively, as you correctly noted, the monetary intervention by the feds did save the market from complete destruction, however, it cannot be ignored that their is a massive liquidity crisis within the institutions of the US and from abroad. 

If you look at the repo actions the feds are taking, they are literally taking up anything under the sun as collateral, including making special purpose vehicles to use collateral that they previously were not legally allowed to, for example corporate debt bonds. 

Historically the fed has not had to serve as a repo facility, in fact, before the covid19 crash the fed was trying to completely remove its role in the repo facility. Now its stuck there. Why?

 Because no one wants to loan out USD in a time of so much economic fragility, everyone needs USD, traditionally foreign institutions get USD via mercantilism (trade) and the covid19 pandemic just put the kibosh on that, bad news. 

So the fed steps up, realizes their is a massive liquidity crisis and starts pumping out the bullshit memes (BRRRR) that reflect that 99% of this sub actually has no idea how the fed reserve works and what it does. 

If you want to look at some correlated graphs check out the USD dollar strength with respect to corporation profits. You MIGHT notice the trend that when the dollar is STRONG corporate profits are FLAT . The USD has been strong since 14' and corporate profits have also been flat, regardless of the stonks only go up memes, which as im sure you know is because of corporations becoming incredibly leveraged and buying back their own stocks, creating stock evaluations that aren't based in reality but rather on chasing a sugar high. 

Anyways,

TLDR; US dollar is in high demand world wide, their ain't enough dollars to meet that demand in the global system so Jpow is trying to print his way out of a hairy situation. Its obviously more nuanced than that but were to stupid to understand it

**-- TLDR is down below --**

Just gonna start spitting facts cuz i know were all retarded here.

* GameStop has a 97% short float right now.
* 56 million float - 54.3 million shares short
* Today, someone **covered 250k** shares - It sent **GameStop up 12%**

Source: [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)

Recent Data

32.1 % **350,000** 2020-**06-08 10:15:02**

31.1 % **100,000** 2020-**06-08 08:00:03**

***What would happen if 54.3 MILLION shares were purchased due to a squeeze?***

**Important Dates:**

**6/9 Earnings Report**

**6/12 Annual Shareholder meeting**

Out of all of the **Retard Retail‚Ñ¢** pumps weve seen over the last 1-2 weeks. SAVE, PLAY, MGM, HTZ, CCL, AAL.... GameStop has had an average price of **$4.20** and hasnt moved much in about 30 days.

**The 1500% increase in Sales:**

Guano Flu has resulted in a record setting quarter for video game sales with GameStop seeing 1500% increase.

Source: [https://www.reuters.com/article/esports-business-video-game-spending-idUSFLMKyQGy](https://www.reuters.com/article/esports-business-video-game-spending-idUSFLMKyQGy)

**So why would they move now?**

The short interest has been stupidly high prior to Bat Scratch Fever. The borrow rates as you can see above have been approx. 30% but whats happening? Two things:

1. The bond holders are shorting Gamestop shares as a hedge against BK
2. Large retail/institutional holders are enjoying a JUICY 30% borrow rate by lending out their shares

*Ok retard, speed it up...*

Gamestop issued new bonds, which have a 2023 maturity. The bonds are up +20% in 48 hours. Signaling theres interest for them, which means Gamestop IS NOT AT RISK FOR BK AND HAS CASH, LIKELY THROUGH 2023.

* **Bond holders have no reason to continue shorting shares as a hedge and paying insane borrow rates**
* **Large holders have no reason to continue to lend shares**

**The Console Cycle**

Sony and MSFT are releasing new consoles this year - if the stock is not going CH11, then the console cycle ( Gamestop's largest margin/sqft items ) has not been even remotely priced in. The reveal was supposed to be 6/4 but with the BLM hijacking all media outlets its been postponed. Should be within the next few weeks bulding further hype.

GameStop is currently trading at 1/2 BOOK VALUE.

This is because everyone has become incredibly confident they are going to be forced into BK

But after doing 4:20 mins of DD ive realized that just aint happening chief.

**So why would they move now?**

The short interest has been stupidly high prior to Bat Scratch Fever. The borrow rates as you can see above have been approx. 30% but whats happening? Two things:

1. The bond holders are shorting Gamestop shares as a hedge against BK
2. Large retail/institutional holders are enjoying a JUICY 30% borrow rate by lending out their shares

*Ok retard, speed it up...*

Gamestop issued new bonds, which have a 2023 maturity. The bonds are up +20% in 48 hours. Signaling theres interest for them, which means Gamestop IS NOT AT RISK FOR BK AND HAS CASH, LIKELY THROUGH 2023.

* **Bond holders have no reason to continue shorting shares as a hedge and paying insane borrow rates**
* **Large holders have no reason to continue to lend shares**

**The Console Cycle**

Sony and MSFT are releasing new consoles this year - if the stock is not going CH11, then the console cycle ( Gamestop's largest margin/sqft items ) has not been even remotely priced in. The reveal was supposed to be 6/4 but with the BLM hijacking all media outlets its been postponed. Should be within the next few weeks bulding further hype.

GameStop is currently trading at 1/2 BOOK VALUE.

This is because everyone has become incredibly confident they are going to be forced into BK

But after doing 4:20 mins of DD ive realized that just aint happening chief.

THIS IS TERRIBLE DD. You've literally provided the worst and most retarded take on a stonk I've ever seen. 

&gt;*I'm currently a user of Slack and it is far superior than Microsoft free software Teams.* 

Yea? And I thought the Dreamcast was fucking great, but where's Sega now? Holding the bag and collecting Sonic royalties like some washed up Hollywood starlet. I've used Slack, it's a messaging app that looks and operates great but it's a Lexus in a market where people fine with a truck. BUT LET ME BE CLEAR IT'S NOT REPLACING EMAIL. 

Also Slack is great for forward thinking, west-coast companies, but some more traditional companies have made technology investments and aren't going to buy the shiny new object because they have something in place. 

While you think teams is retarded, a lot of corporate environments are O365 shops and guess what integrates easily for a non-tech saavy company..... Teams. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. **WORK is unfairly compared to ZM...** no most people are betting tech stocks have blown out user base numbers or earnings because of COVID. People are obviously figuring out 1-tech's in a bubble driven by COVID and temporary remote adoption, 2- most tech companies who aren't blowing out their userbase numbers have to fall back on EPS and honestly most SaaS companies are NOT profitable. So the gig is up. 
2. **WORK from home is the new norm**... no it's not, why do you think retail is still up. I tried buying puts on GPS and GME and have been holding the bag until now. I think GAP is retarded as fuck and I don't want to be around other people shopping but people don't want to be in the house. Yes, it'll be the new norm if we have another COVID breakout, but how many more users is that going to bring Slack between now and 06/19? 
3. **The market liquidity is high.** It was and is high but if you didn't get the memo, people are begging JPOW to print tomorrow and calls are getting fucked.

&amp;#x200B;

PLEASE DO NOT BUY WORK. It's currently $2.00 above pre-COVID ATH and didn't give a billings guidance for 2020 meaning that people are trying to get out of their contracts because we're going back to work and also some companies don't think an AIM clone is revolutionary.

&gt;Short sellers desperate to close their positions paid as much as 1,005 euros a share during the session following Sunday‚Äôs news that there was less than 6 percent of VW voting stock still floating in the market.

&gt;At that price Volkswagen‚Äôs voting stock was worth 296 billion euros ($370 billion), or more than the $343 billion market capitalization of Exxon Mobil.

* GameStop has a 97% short float right now.
* 56 million float - 54.3 million shares short
* Today, someone **covered 250k** shares - It sent **GameStop up 12%**

***What would happen if 54.3 MILLION shares were purchased due to a squeeze?***

**Important Dates:**

**6/9 Earnings Report**

**6/12 Annual Shareholder meeting**

Out of all of the **Retard Retail‚Ñ¢** pumps weve seen over the last 1-2 weeks. SAVE, PLAY, MGM, HTZ, CCL, AAL.... GameStop has had an average price of **$4.20** and hasnt moved much in about 30 days.

**The 1500% increase in Sales:**

Guano Flu has resulted in a record setting quarter for video game sales with GameStop seeing 1500% increase.

**So why would they move now?**

The short interest has been stupidly high prior to Bat Scratch Fever. The borrow rates as you can see above have been approx. 30% but whats happening? Two things:

1. The bond holders are shorting Gamestop shares as a hedge against BK
2. Large retail/institutional holders are enjoying a JUICY 30% borrow rate by lending out their shares

*Ok retard, speed it up...*

Gamestop issued new bonds, which have a 2023 maturity. The bonds are up +20% in 48 hours. Signaling theres interest for them, which means Gamestop IS NOT AT RISK FOR BK AND HAS CASH, LIKELY THROUGH 2023.

* **Bond holders have no reason to continue shorting shares as a hedge and paying insane borrow rates**
* **Large holders have no reason to continue to lend shares**

**The Console Cycle**

Sony and MSFT are releasing new consoles this year - if the stock is not going CH11, then the console cycle ( Gamestop's largest margin/sqft items ) has not been even remotely priced in. The reveal was supposed to be 6/4 but with the BLM hijacking all media outlets its been postponed. Should be within the next few weeks bulding further hype.

GameStop is currently trading at 1/2 BOOK VALUE.

This is because everyone has become incredibly confident they are going to be forced into BK

But after doing 4:20 mins of DD ive realized that just aint happening chief.

**-- TLDR is down below --**

Just gonna start spitting facts cuz i know were all retarded here.

* GameStop has a 97% short float right now.
* 56 million float - 54.3 million shares short
* Today, someone **covered 250k** shares - It sent **GameStop up 12%**

Recent Data

32.1 % **350,000** 2020-**06-08 10:15:02**

31.1 % **100,000** 2020-**06-08 08:00:03**

***What would happen if 54.3 MILLION shares were purchased due to a squeeze?***

**Important Dates:**

**6/9 Earnings Report**

**6/12 Annual Shareholder meeting**

Out of all of the **Retard Retail‚Ñ¢** pumps weve seen over the last 1-2 weeks. SAVE, PLAY, MGM, HTZ, CCL, AAL.... GameStop has had an average price of **$4.20** and hasnt moved much in about 30 days.

**The 1500% increase in Sales:**

Guano Flu has resulted in a record setting quarter for video game sales with GameStop seeing 1500% increase.

Source: [https://www.reuters.com/article/esports-business-video-game-spending-idUSFLMKyQGy](https://www.reuters.com/article/esports-business-video-game-spending-idUSFLMKyQGy)

**So why would they move now?**

The short interest has been stupidly high prior to Bat Scratch Fever. The borrow rates as you can see above have been approx. 30% but whats happening? Two things:

1. The bond holders are shorting Gamestop shares as a hedge against BK
2. Large retail/institutional holders are enjoying a JUICY 30% borrow rate by lending out their shares

*Ok retard, speed it up...*

Gamestop issued new bonds, which have a 2023 maturity. The bonds are up +20% in 48 hours. Signaling theres interest for them, which means Gamestop IS NOT AT RISK FOR BK AND HAS CASH, LIKELY THROUGH 2023.

* **Bond holders have no reason to continue shorting shares as a hedge and paying insane borrow rates**
* **Large holders have no reason to continue to lend shares**

**The Console Cycle**

Sony and MSFT are releasing new consoles this year - if the stock is not going CH11, then the console cycle ( Gamestop's largest margin/sqft items ) has not been even remotely priced in. The reveal was supposed to be 6/4 but with the BLM hijacking all media outlets its been postponed. Should be within the next few weeks bulding further hype.

GameStop is currently trading at 1/2 BOOK VALUE.

This is because everyone has become incredibly confident they are going to be forced into BK

But after doing 4:20 mins of DD ive realized that just aint happening chief.

Im jacked to the NIPS on the below positions:

- The ""gamer cafe"" business pivot idea is absolutely doomed to fail, unless it basically becomes Chuck E Cheese
- Burry reduced his stake
- They bombed earnings
- The run up previous to now actually wasn't really market sentiment for a lot of it, it was shares getting called back for that vote (which IMO Burry triggered/contributed to specifically so he could dump it and get out)

Yeah they‚Äôre not gonna be in business in 10 years but who cares, the PS5 will have an optical drive (on the main model anyway) and GME‚Äôs balance sheet isn‚Äôt all that bad so they‚Äôre not in any immediate risk of bankruptcy IMO.

1,2020-07-03,"I don't think hoping for a short squeeze is a great investment thesis.  In fact, this thing would probably have to triple before shorts would even begin to cover.

That said, there are two things that I think provide quite a lot of downside safety.  One, obviously, is the console refresh.  Yes, a lot of people are not going to get a new console at GME.  But, they will capture some of those sales.  Secondly, they are aggressively cost cutting.  As long as they continue to close stores, I see that as a good sign.  The business is obviously shrinking at a significant rate, but the people who are bearish on GME have already priced it where that revenue decline is factored in.  If you value the inventory at zero, and then just look at liquidation value of the remaining assets, you're paying a fair price at $4.50 for GME.  That's assuming cash flow continues it's current trend.  They have *plenty* of cash, and the bond exchange took roughly a $200m payout in March out a few more years.  Their liquidity position doesn't suggest a bankruptcy is in any way imminent, and they should have at least 18 months of runway to, essentially, change their entire business model.  And *that* is truly the most important thing to look for, as a catalyst.  If they don't make some pretty dramatic changes in the next 4-6 months, this isn't worth buying.  And I don't think this idea of opening gaming venues for people to sit and effectively have a LAN party is a good one.  If they were 21+ and able to serve alcohol, I'd probably be a lot more enthusiastic about the long term potential. üôÇ",ahminus,wallstreetbets,1.0

That idiot tweets anything and everything and then cherry picks through his history to show how much of a prophet he is.

Will Meade is currently bag holding GameStop and Under Armour because he's old as fuck and out of touch with reality. He thinks these popular brands from the mid 2000s still have a chance at coming back. He will pump there mercislessly hoping to create a short squeeze.

Do not follow any of his tweets unless you think you can beat his followers to the punch. He pumped OAS and GNC over a month ago and I estimated that his followers chased with roughly $1.5 million in purchases.

However, Gamestop isn't something i'm bullish on, like even remotely, so I don't care. If its something I want to keep that pays a decent dividend i've been setting a higher further otm strike. I plan on longing it anyways and even a premium of like .50 a share helps to lower cost basis.  


Basically the way I force myself to look at it is, if I would be happy selling at the strike price + premium I don't really care. For instance if my cost basis is 15 and my shares got assigned with at a strike of 21.50 and I got paid a premium of 1.50 on the contract and my shares got called away I would still be okay.",thegiantcat1,wallstreetbets,48.0

Yeah, calls 9/4 in GME are like 7.8 a share and you might sell a covered call for .96 a share at an $8 strike but if it goes above 8 you capped your earnings at the premium of $96.

If you go further out and sell a call at idk, .11 for a $12 strike you can make $11 of ""free"" money but if the stock tanks you just added that downside to your ""free"" money for minimal gains that got eaten in a flash.",Markham5,wallstreetbets,12.0

16,2020-09-09,"You can argue all you want that GME isn't Blockbuster, but at end of the day, they are getting killed by all sides. So much of gaming (whether PC or console) is moving to digital distribution, and Microsoft, Sony, Ninento, Steam, all major publishers (ATVI, EA, etc). are pushing it hard because they have seen how much money Apple makes by taking a rip off digital downloads on the iOS ecosystem. 

And, for those boomers who still want physical game copies - you can literally order it on Amazon, which will deliver the game day of release to you on your couch. You no longer need to drive to the store, wait in line, etc. Same goes for console releases - why would I wait in-line for days to get the console at midnight of release when I can pre-order it on Amazon and have it show up at my door on release day.

Take a look at your historic chart (I checked). It's interesting - the 2007 share price run-up was AFTER the Nov 2006 release of consoles (PS3, etc.). Strong sales, etc. that surprised to the upside. Traders then ran up GME in 2013 AHEAD of console launch in Nov 2013 (PS4). But if you look at share price movement after Nov 2013, it cratered as clearly sales results were disappointing. That is why you are not seeing the same enthusiasm this time around for the next generation of consoles - traders have realized that consumer behavior has changed so much since 2007 that people will most likely order consoles online and have it delivered.

The biggest bearish case here is that: COVID-19 accelerated the decline of business. For months this year, you couldn't even go to a store to buy a game. Instead, everyone was forced to either order on Amazon or digital download (some people for the first time ever). Once you find out the convenience of this route, hard to want to go back to the store.",ArtanisHero,wallstreetbets,16.0

92,2020-09-09,"I decided to look at GME charts just out of interest. This comment is mostly technical, with a tiny bit fundamentals (PPE in balance sheet) as i've looked at charts/gaps and a bit of the 10-K. So please keep that in mind before any autistic screeching. 

If you believe in gap filling, then there are 2 big gaps that have potential to fill if this starts moving, closest one is the large gap at $12-$15 that formed in late January 2019 that remains unfilled. The second gap that lies unfilled formed in Nov. 2015 when the SP opened down from $44-$40.  


The first gap requires a 100% SP move to fill it, as well the MC would be sitting just shy of 1B (972M) @ $15/share, which I honestly believe to be somewhat reasonable for GME to achieve considering, and this is important, **GME NET PPE (PROPERTY/PLANT/EQUIPMENT) IS 1.04B.** Essentially @ $15/share GME will still be worth less than what they claim as their NET PPE on the 2020 balance sheet.  
*Caution: GME used ROU (right-of-use) this year for their leases, per the new accounting rule ASC 842, which expanded the PPE line by 767M from 2019.*  


The second gap that lies unfilled formed in Nov. 2015 when the SP opened down from $44-$40. This would require the SP to move considerably (475%) in order to fill the gap. MC would be valued at \~2.8b if the SP moved to close that gap. This one is highly unlikely and would require a massive short squeeze like you are suggesting, but like you said, if NKLA has an 18 billion MC, i guess anything is possible.

The game industry is moving steadily to publisher storefronts and console storefronts. That really leaves them with nothing but merch and accessories, a la Radioshack. Digital games will do to Gamestop what the MP3 did to Music stores.

What would draw somebody away from Amazon or Walmart to shop online with gamestop? Can they really afford offering the same shipping perks as the big boys? They are really setting themselves up to be squashed if they try to go up against them. I dont think retail exclusive content is nearly as much of a consumer driver as it was in the past for them.

You're right they do have an old business model, but they are making massive inside changes and starting to make the right decisions regarding running and changing the business model and the board is starting to improve with recent additions.

This is what everyone is sleeping on with GME, they just see the past business model and think it will die. In reality they are pushing for a massive turnaround with a majority online presence. Having the Chewy founder come in with a 10% stake is a major win for GME.

You're speculating that they wont turn a profit simply because there hasnt been one this year. That doesnt mean anything moving forward. 

Worst case scenario, im wrong, gamestop fails. However the stock pulls a APRN, they fall to $2 a share and then 100% shorters are all forced to cover, rocketing the SP for a week or two. You can still get out with a profit if timed right.",Stonksflyingup,wallstreetbets,7.0

13,2020-09-10,"the main point i want you to arrive at is how this can be a good investment, regardless if they think the company is good or bad. Current market cap is quite low at the moment as there is a very small amount of shares outstanding. The company doesnt need to dominate the gaming industry for the SP to increase in value. If GME can continue to revenue its $6B/year, then they can continue to have profits of $250-300M each year. If the current MC is the exact same as your one year EBITDA, that doesnt make any sense, therefore it's undervalued, regardless how you feel about the business. (thats pretty much where we are).

If the newer board members can help turn GME from a dead company to profitable company (doesnt have to be a lot of profit) then the SP will skyrocket and shorters will be screwed. Industry cycles are a thing, and right now GME has the advantage of their industry coming into a high sales cycle for the next 2-3 years. This is what im betting on. Not a lot of my capital, only around 3k.

Couple that with naive new gamers getting them for christmas as well as naive mall shoppers making quick pitstops into gamestop to buy shit for ""hard to shop for relatives that like video games and paraphernalia"" and you have a perfect storm for one juicy few months of sales and pumping and a hopefully great GME announcement to keep up with the times (digital download, game streaming service, online gaming acquisition, product shift). I have a bunch of LEAPs and shares, so I believe sincerely that they just can't die slowly with volatility like this.

34,2020-10-01,"I loaded up on GME at $2.70 and $2.82, and started selling covered calls in March. On those shares, I eventually got my $5.50 calls called away in May when it spiked over $6 because of the proxy vote.  A few weeks later, I started reloading, bought 5 different 10,000 share chunks, at an average of $4.24, and started selling covered calls again for the week after next expiry (weeklies).  Those were only bringing in between $0.07 and $0.15 most of the time.  When it started spiking, I paused on selling calls.  Eventually had some called away at $7 on a $0.60 weekly, and rebought those shares again in the low $6s.

35,2020-10-01,"How many people here are negative all time? 

I suck at this! Losing money sucks so bad, especially because I seem to paper hand positions once they are down and yet when look back at my contract if I just held it, it would have been profitable. I had NKLA $30p and sold the Friday before Milton quit and the stock tanked. I had DQ before it mooned 30%. I had GME calls that I took the advice of ""leave while you have profit!"" So I left at 20% up and missed out on like 280% more growth. 

  Then when I decided that wasn't working now I diamond hand and so far that isn't always working either. I held SSSS calls yesterday, thinking ""alright don't panic sell..."" only for the underlying stock to tank 10% more today. 

At this point I'm just chasing losses. The only positions that have done well for me are leaps on blue chips (holding aapl 1/15/22  $110c, $115c, and $120c)

71,2020-10-01,"The IV is still high, but the premium you pay for the itm calls is barely affected by the IV if it's deep ITM. Basically all the premium is from intrinsic value at that point, so there's very little IV crush that can occur. When you buy a deep itm call, it moves like the stonk but with more leverage. Example: jan 3c trading at about 7.38 right now according to RH (yes there's a bid ask spread). 3 + 7.38 = 10.38. Actual closing price of gme shares is 10.26. So out of the 738$ you pay for the 3c option, only 12$ of that is being paid for ""extrinsic"" value. That's 1.6% of the whole cost (12/738). Which means, 98.4% of the premium you're paying is all intrinsic value. So you really can't get IV crushed. Granted youd still get fucked if the stonk goes down bigly, but you would with any instrument. Worst case is the stonk literally doesn't move until expiration and you lose the 12$ of extrinsic value and you sell the call for roughly the same. If you want to see what I'm talking about, compare the contract prices of 3c between October, November, January. You'll see they are very similar, but each month out you're paying slightly more premium.",Rusty_Shacklefurd69,wallstreetbets,71.0

3,2020-10-03,"People shorted it because they were expecting it to go bankrupt even before covid. It was in really bad shape, but its turning around now, and the founder of chewy now owns a huge stake and has expressed interest in turning it into a gaming version of chewy. May not work out, but based on the last earning call, I think it has a pretty strong chance.

Ya, next earnings call is in December probably, good ways off yet. Console pre-sales will be met. Everywhere sold out the day of, and will probably be sold out for the next 6 months based on how the industry is right now. Ungodly high demand, production cant even remotely keep up. I think this is the longest between major console releases ever too, which should makes it even more crazy. 

If you buy options on GME, id suggest not buying anything dated before January. Also keep in mind the IV is really high, so if the stock doesn't have big moves between now and then, the value of the options will get crushed even if the stock price is the same. That IV price will go back up if it jumps for earnings, but the pain in the time in between isn't small.

Volume was also pretty low today.

Just checked on Etrade and the hard to borrow rate is 35% or about $.01/day on 1 share. This means the stock is going to have to decrease daily at least a $.01/day for them just to break even, not even make money. They have to pay that on day trades and it spans weekends and holidays so everyone holding over the weekend is paying 3 days of a hard to borrow rate.

*Applicable interest will be charged on each short position you open whether the position is held overnight or day traded. Positions opened and closed on the same day will incur a minimum of one day interest or multiple days interest if settlement spans weekends or holidays.*

Patience is a virtue. Time is on our side. This is being shorted like 50% daily. Here is a link to the actually daily numbers [http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html](http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html). Keep holding and buy more as it is on discount right now.

Derp, knowing this was going to happen on the given date because they started it by trying to exit their short position, could buy up a huge 50k contracts with 5 days to exp at 20c for pennies per contract.  They cover 5 million shares while the stock rockets to 100.  Who is really going to buy 50k call options on GME right then, with that obscene IV and knowing it would crash pretty soon.  So they exercise those calls to close out of the remainder of their short position.

13,2020-10-03,"If you go a certain distance past margin, brokerages will liquidate assets I believe, to cover the gap?  The long calls would more than cover that in theory, but if the brokerage sold them at bid, and the bid/ask hadn't moved up as quickly on those, there could be a loss there I believe?


This would be much simpler with a normal stock.  100% of float short means its pretty hard to tell what GME would do, the stock price could hit 50-100 per share, so 2 sold calls being exercised would put me past my margin limit.  And since squeezes crash hard/fast once they hit their peak, that could go really badly if I wasn't there to sell my call.


Is the above correct?  I feel like it has different risks that the standard spread because of the squeeze potential.  If the above is right, maybe it would be stupid of me to try this.  Please tell me if I'm retarded and not understanding!",Ackilles,wallstreetbets,13.0
14,2020-10-03,"That is a core part of a short squeeze no?

I don't want to exit my long positions because it jumps erratically, but doing some short dated calendar spreads seems like a good option while its a bit stagnant.

&amp;#x200B;

But lets say the squeeze happened, is it feasible a short seller would exercise the call option before its expiration to cover due to a lack of liquid stock trading and the price ramping up extremely quickly?

There‚Äôs too many people in this sub now that there will always be someone with a more ridiculous gain to feel jealous of. Also don‚Äôt trade shit penny stocks and hype stocks like GME or NKLA or whatever. A couple retards are bound to get lucky on them but most will get assblasted. Stick to the proven names Iike NVDA. They‚Äôre not going vertical to make you instant 1000% but they‚Äôre not gonna nuke your account either.

TWTR is a play I like long term. I see this easily doubling in the next couple years due to fundamentals (increasing users and subscription modeling coming soon) and technicals and have been building up a position in 2022 LEAPs. BABA is gold. Undervalued af and people are only slowly realizing how dominant they are, they just announced their cloud business is going to be profitable soon.

Their P/E went negative at like $7, EPS is like -5 and what do they have to make up for that in revenue growth? Beta is below 1 so low volatility is the only recourse here from a contrarian pov.

I wouldn't be surprised to see them all wiped out.

I genuinely hope it works out for you but I just do not see the upside to GameStop. They simply do not have a sustainable business model with increased internet speeds and developers releasing directly digital.

Even realized a loss in 2019.  Acct was about 170k end of 2019...mostly from earned income, and it think it was lousy...  then pcg bankruptcy hype train came and made a decent amount on shorting hundreds of puts, buying stock and riding it...

Would anyone like to spend some time this weekend adding to the discussion?

So, I think I have been obsessing over GME and this is what I have come up with.

There is also a post about this.

[www.shortsqueeze.com](http://www.shortsqueeze.com/)

Days To Cover (Short Interest Ratio) 10.3

Short Percent of Float 136.03 %

Short % Increase / Decrease 15 %

Short Interest (Shares Short) 66,410,000

Short Interest (Shares Short) - Prior 57,860,000

Shares Float 48,820,000 

For anyone wondering:

**Days To Cover:**

‚ÄúThe 'days to cover' represents the total estimated amount of time for all short sellers active in the market with a particular security to buy back the shares that were lent to them by a brokerage.

**Short Percent of Float:**

Now if your looking at that next number that says short percent of float and wondering what that is all about it is the percentage of shares currently short relative to the total number of shares floated. So yes you are reading that correctly and there is a short interest of 136.03%.

Go have a look, this stock has like no retail movement right now, why on earth would it ever go up from where its currently at? Why are people investing in it?

Well Ryan Cohen‚Äôs interest in the stock brought it back to life due to his association with the E-Commerce giant CHEWY, and Dr. Michael Burry seems to think that this business has some underlying fundamentals that are going to allow it to be profitable in the future.

The business is cashflow rich right now and it easily has enough money to weather it through this next console cycle which historically has been a great revenue booster.

So, GameStop is not dying, they are closing stores and reducing operating costs they have an E-Commerce guru and an autistic genius both invested.

**What is the catalyst you ask?**  
 

Well it could be any of these things:

\- GME call a vote would require board members to call back their shares.

\- GME announce a buyback again.

\- Activist investor such as [Patrick M. Byrne ‚Äì Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_M._Byrne)

What is naked selling? ([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedshorting.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nakedshorting.asp))

Now  if your still paying attention I am hinting at the possibility that  naked short selling is happening and everyone is trying to drive this  stock to the core of the earth.

Now we can also see that from the source.

[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)

The  number of available shares of the past couple of days has risen from  900 to 550,000 and the FEE has steadily decreased, in my opinion that  would be the likely result of people trying to unwind their short  positions and the borrower trying to incentivise people piling back into  the short position.

**I know this is too fucking long but if you want to make money you like to read.**

[https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities](https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securities)

GME  has been on that list now for a long time and starting next week I  believe due to the SEC rules short positions will have to start  covering, and these are short positions that were opened sub $7 when the  stock is now trading at $9.45. This stock is owned primarily by  institutions, people are going to get obliterated by whatever happens  here.

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/thresholdlist.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/thresholdlist.asp)

As you can see by now I am insinuating that this may be obviously a potential short squeeze situation.

**The Fundamentals:**

This is the stuff that really matters to the retards here.

[https://fintel.io/so/us/gme](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme)

This boasts a list of institutional investors such as.

\- [RC Ventures LLC](https://fintel.io/i/rc-ventures-llc) (Ryan Cohen)

\- [Scion Asset Management, LLC](https://fintel.io/i/scion-asset-management-llc) (Dr. Michael Burry)

\- [VANGUARD GROUP INC](https://fintel.io/i/vanguard-group)

\- [BlackRock Inc.](https://fintel.io/i/blackrock)

Go  have a look, this stock has like no retail movement right now, why on  earth would it ever go up from where its currently at? Why are people  investing in it?

Well Ryan Cohen‚Äôs  interest in the stock brought it back to life due to his association  with the E-Commerce giant CHEWY, and Dr. Michael Burry seems to think  that this business has some underlying fundamentals that are going to  allow it to be profitable in the future.

The  business is cashflow rich right now and it easily has enough money to  weather it through this next console cycle which historically has been a  great revenue booster.

So,  GameStop is not dying, they are closing stores and reducing operating  costs they have an E-Commerce guru and an autistic genius both invested.

**What is the catalyst you ask?**

Well it could be any of these things:

\- GME call a vote would require board members to call back their shares.

\- GME announce a buyback again.

\- Activist investor such as [Patrick M. Byrne ‚Äì Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_M._Byrne)

\- Burry or Cohen could increase their stake.

\- Shorts could be forced to cover due to SEC Violations (SHO)

\- Strong positive earnings due to console cycle

\- Autistic sentiment

Take your pick.

One of my longest posts ever was me trying to convince a JWN investor to get short term puts as a hedge against her calls. I even replied to some dude weighing long term AAPL vs. JWN telling him AAPL.  Literally, all their peers but KSS and DDS have tanked hard. Nordstrom will be killed by Millennials and Gen Z in addition to clientele that moves on to other stuff.  The female shopper has and always will be fickle. It's  going to tank. It would need to pull an AMZN or GME to recover , but it won't since it's just a clothing store. They have too much competition. Physical stores are considered debt liabilities now. They have to sell off 30% more of their stores before they can recover. It might recover in 2021 in September or December, but honestly find something else to get hyped about: DDOG, MSFT, WWR , APHA or anything that is clearly showing up trend and euphoria.

22,2020-10-09,"This is the very likely answer. 

OP, you are currently suffering from hindsight bias - ""I should've known X"". The truth is that you probably have very little to no experience in company valuations and trading on the capital markets. 

Even if you had bought companies like KODK, GME, or ZM at the very bottom - you would've never held to their absolute highest point. You know why? Because you had no reason to believe they would go that high. You didn't buy those stocks because unlike multibillion dollar hedge funds that have teams of MBAs, Quants, and Analysts working around the clock to arbitrage any potential profit out of those securities - you are trading on ""gut feeling"" not any semblance of logic or reason.

The only way you would've ""gotten rich quick"" was if you somehow randomly lucked into a once-in-a-lifetime moonshot at it's lowest point, fell asleep, and then suddenly woke up at the precise point it was at it's highest (and then for a magical reason deciding to sell right then).

And now everyone that shorted it is scared of the price going too high (because they have to buy back shares they borrowed). So now some of the shorts start buying back their stock before they suffer heavy losses. And this pushes the stock up even more. This causes even more of the shorts to buy back the stock. Price moons even more. This cycle continues. This is known as a short squeeze.

It's a feedback loop. FOMO + Price catalysts + shorts covering will cause GME to potentially spike to breathtaking heights  (20, 50, 100+).

I wrote a script to pull down consecutive days GME has been on the threshold list starting from Jan 1. This isn't the first time this year GME has passed the 13 day mark and it doesn't seem like it has an effect on the share price. I don't know how the rules work though, so maybe it means something this time.

255,2020-10-09,"The key thing is that stocks need very little reason to go up. The deal with MSFT made it go up by a threshold amount where people that were short GME are starting to be margin called. If enough people are squeezed we'll hit another threshold value where more people will be squeezed out of their short positions and be forced to buy GME, driving its price further up. Understand that there's not much yet proven about the fundamentals, don't get stuck on that. But look at GME historically, every single console release has driven its price up. So now combine the new GME leadership, they have good financials, a new console cycle releases next month, the deal with MSFT, and it's a heavily shorted company, and you get a potential short squeeze that can make a lot of money.

That's all I care about, I don't give a shit about whether or not it becomes the next blockbuster or whatever, I just want to make money off of it soon. I do not intend to invest in GME, I'm just speculating that it will be short squeezed.",sniperdogruffo,wallstreetbets,255.0

I have a problem with execution when it comes to closing spreads. A few months back i learned to open spreads in order to cap gains/protect myself from losses because i was banned day trading. 

In the past, I have ""bungled"" closing spreads with seemingly poor timing turning for example a $500 gain into a $100 gain in a panic. 

Currently have bought 5x GME 15c 1/15/2021 (+$675) and sold (to cap gains/mitigate loss) 5x GME 16c 1/15/2021 (-$460). 

In this case, do I want to wait for a run down to sell to close my purchased calls, then ride the run down to buy to close the sold calls? What is the  best way to execute this because I am literally too retarded to figure it out",buck_tardwater,wallstreetbets,405.0

Microsoft deal net positive to GameStop thesis, says Jefferies Jefferies analyst Stephanie Wissink reiterated a Buy rating on GameStop (GME) after it announced a cloud solutions partnership with Microsoft (MSFT). Wissink said the news is a net positive to her thesis, as it embeds three coincident events: GameStop's planned implementation of Microsoft's back office systems, rollout of Microsoft's Surface and mobile tech across GameStop stores, and a revenue sharing agreement for Xbox digital sub value over the lifecycle of the customer.

It's the Ann Taylor or JC Penney of gaming. The announcement caused a spike, algo trading and short covering waiting for this. Perfect squeeze scenario.

737,2020-10-08,"I‚Äôm not on options but on stocks long as well. May not print money like GME yet, they‚Äôre going for a sustainable growth. They are heavily working on making things sustainable.

My theory is, AMD will lowball Nvidia on Price for same or maybe slightly better performance. They didn‚Äôt have to redesign a GPU PCB (3000 series GPUs have weird PCB shape). Making shit that tight is also another cost. They showed a decent 3 fan cooler, just like non-reference cards. So, cost of manufacturing would be way less than Nvidia. So, they can actually sell cheaper.

Then adding the experience they got with 7NM, less voltage and more clock speed (on boost) is a possibility now. Considering twice the size of the die; it gives me threadripper vibes. I think she delayed the announcement just because Jensen did some cheeky play. She wants to hit harder and right now, only way of doing that would be;

1) going for software with drivers (which I think what they‚Äôre doing right now)
2) making some crazy shit like x2 cards they did back in the day. That‚Äôd be a shocker for sure. But I don‚Äôt think they can do it so quickly.

GME is investing in their business. They will leverage the huge amount of data they own on how their customer buy products and what they want to sell them more products. It has nothing to do with MSFT per se, they just offer the technology that will help them. The big message is they are starting to roll out their plans to re-invigorate their business. This is happening during new  console cycle - Xbox and PS5 with Switch coming next year all while they are in a perfect situation for an ongoing short squeeze.

Very ripe situation to make some money for everyone involved and to create a company that will NOT be irrelevant in 3-5 years.

Everyone used Blockbuster as an example of a dying company. Blockbuster could have become Netflix. Hell they could have and should have bought Netflix when they were still tiny, but they were too concerned with disrupting their core business. Gamestop is ready and willing to disrupt their business and change things up to grow and survive.

945,2020-10-08,"assuming that you are ok holding GME, you can roll forward diagonally.

So say your short calls are priced at $3.  Find a higher-strike call in the future that is worth about $3 and roll into them at essentially no debit or credit.  

The issue here is that if GME tanks again you lose your gains.  So you can also just let the options expire, get assigned, take your small gain, and move on to the next trade.  When you sell a covered call you are trading away the chance of a large gain for a small guaranteed amount.  If you are not ok with that tradeoff, don't sell covered calls.

I was a retard and failed to close out my short (covered) GME $11.50 10/8 calls this morning when the bid x ask was $0.00 x $0.03.

960,2020-10-08,"Op is right on this and in his comments that the writing has been on the wall.  I've been watching this for a while and didn't make a move, too busy with other shit.  I was out when this dropped so no bIg gAinZ for me on this, BUT WAIT.

I will provide a little DD for you retards.  GME has the highest short interest in the entire market.  292% of the float (float is shares that freely trade).  101% of the shares outstanding (float shares that trade plus locked up shares owned by management, directors, etc.)

So that means on a good catalyst GME is primed to rip higher.  This MSFT deal is a joke of a catalyst but the weak handed shorts started to sell, the stock has been fighting it's way out of the gutter since the summer so if you're a short you've been seeing red since July and if they aren't gonna go out of biz in a global pandemic, they're likely not gonna go out of biz in the short term.

So there's probably a bit more run up in GME short squeezes make stocks really rip, if any of these shorts are balls deep and they get a margin call and have liquidate, i.e., buy more shares to cover the short it adds fuel to the fire.

Some of you who thing you're TSLA jEeNyUsEs over the last year likely didn't know that some of those big rips were due to short squeezes.  They're like pouring gasoline on a fire.

I'm going to go in on this both shares and calls not too balls deep just a bit as the volume today says a bunch of shorts were likely wiped out, watch carefully and be ready to get out in 24 - 48 hours.

19,2020-10-10,"Not OP but I am/was a Gamestop bull.   


Simply put people were so fixated on the comparison that they ignored the fundamentals and the many signs that this was different. Most gamers prefer physical copies of games (by wide margins), the company has started diversifying into other streams of revenue that can't go online as easily, and maybe most importantly, the CEO and directors started doing a ton of things to increase profit margins and balance the company's balance sheets which made it obvious that there were mature adults running the company and that the console cycle refresh wouldn't be a missed opportunity. On top of this they bought bought millions of shares of stock when it was very, very cheap, which made the short squeeze even more likely to happen as there were less shares to cover.   


When you read both the bull and bear theses of Gamestop and looked into their financials it became obvious that the bears were *WAY* too focused on the bigger picture and were missing a very undervalued company in the meantime. I mean just the real estate and movable inventory alone was higher per share than the price per share for a while.   


 I am taking some profit while holding the lions share of my shares even though I know that GME could still fail as a company, but this current short squeeze and price increase was foreseeable for a while because of the short interest and because the company was criminally undervalued.",Spezia-ShwiffMMA,wallstreetbets,19.0

23,2020-10-10,"Except that the short squeeze was predicted by bulls for like a year now, so it's not like this was totally out of the blue.  Everyone following closely knew that GME was a powder keg waiting to explode if the right conditions were meant (ffs it's been more than 100% shorted for like the past year). Yeah he bought WAYYY OTM, but for this particular stock doing that wasn't a for sure loss like it would be with most stocks.   


We also knew that GME's revenues would shoot up, and fast when the consoles came out, and that they were putting themselves in a financial position to profit as much as possible from the new revenue. I guess you could say that he got lucky from the timing of the stock rise, but I wouldn't be surprised if he had some reasons to think it would rise by 10/16.  


Just because the common mentality was that the stock was completely worthless does not mean that the signs weren't out there. GME was my largest holding even before the Burry announcement partially because I bought in for the dividend pre-cut like an idiot, but also partially because I saw that most of the doomsayers were ignoring major factors that could mean Gamestop survives and even thrives. Me being too stupid and risk-averse to buy calls is the reason I didn't make a lot more :(.

While this is not a guarantee of this cycle's performance, wouldn't this be a pretty good position to add in to your current play as well? 

Upside is still pretty good -
1) Price is near fair asset book valuation (~$12) but reflects discount to future performance over the next year currently 
2) Ryan Cohen's counsel to company strategy pivot over the next year
3) Continued company share buy back over the next 12 months alone will help to drive the price to ~$94 alone assuming market cap returns to $6 billion",leoschen,wallstreetbets,32.0

And what made you want to buy calls in july? August 3rd it had a 3 month descending triangle breakout and held $4 level strong, that woulda been my ideal entry.

For $5400 I woulda done $3k in jan 2021 $5 calls (lots of gaming hype, good chance it squeezes again to $6+ over next 2 earnings and tons of open interest here) and $2400 in $10 october calls at $0.03 each for the lotto squeeze play. Sell 25% at $7.50 and now im pure profits. Sell my $5 calls at $10, and sell the rest at $13.

where does the 8-10bn come from. Honestly i am curious.

141,2020-10-09,"Ya its really rough.  IV on GME was already in the 130% range BEFORE any of this happened yesterday.  I saw 200+ on a few calls I looked at earlier.  Its a tough call, there are a lot of things that could cause this to run again soon.  But there is no way of knowing if they will happen, or when.  Cohen could announce they've reached a deal for him to take an active roll in the company.  MSFT could announce buying a stake in the company or an extension of the deal mentioned this week (would fit with what they are doing lately in gaming), GME could do share buy backs with the shitload of cash they have, GME could get price target increases (usually good for a nice dollar jump) or a plethora of other things.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I sold about half of my position, and am now watching the stock like a hawk for it to slow down.  Aiming to reinvest between 10.5 and 12 a share.  It isn't a great one to buy when its rocketing (until/unless we get to the run that actually squeezes) unless you do a quick flip.

159,2020-10-09,"It is possible a lot were for sure.  It is pretty unlikely that the majority were.  From my understanding, a majority of the shorts are held by institutional investors.  There is no reason for them to cover and rebuy unless they were able to scoop an extra buck or two out of it.

If the stock continues to climb as it has (currently up 200% over the last 2-3 months), eventually the shorts are going to get tired of losing money hand over fist and start covering.  It is entirely possible this stock won't squeeze...but even if it doesn't, it is still going to be going up enough that it is a hugely profitable trade.  

&amp;#x200B;

Having this much short interest is holding the price down quite a bit, and the stock just keeps getting more and more good news going into a time period where the stock traditionally doubles in value anyway (console releases).  Three months ago I was 100% certain the company was a zombie, unaware that it was dead already.  Now it looks like it may become a real company again, for the first time in a long time.  Not because of the console release, but because of everything they are currently doing to turn the company around.

I think a ton of people made great plays being bullish, it was the right move and im truly happy people are making money.

m, console sales are extremely thin profit margins for everyone involved in selling them including both sony and xbox.  The real money comes from game sales, which GME is extremely behind in the E-commerce game of this.  Most games are purchased online now, not to mention both sony and xbox offering discounted disc tray-less versions of the console.

I bought puts 70 days out, even if this squeezes for 2 weeks I will still be able to make money.

213,2020-10-09,"No. 

There probably was some short sellers covering positions today but today was just a reaction to the news.

If a short squeeze happens, say GME price levels out and stays high, then you're going to see more upwards jump as shorts cover their lost positions. Potentially huge jumps. No promises though, GME short squeeze has been in talks for many months. 

Granted the Microsoft news could provide a catalyst.",duuurrrrrhhhh,wallstreetbets,213.0

221,2020-10-09,"They are going to sell a lot of console units with a high attach rate (secondary products with the primary purchase) over the next 2 year's. They will be more than ok to survive and redevelop. They have some great board members with reggie from nintendo as a new addition from march. 

Increased revenue stream from the recent msft announcement, which before Thursday was not priced in and added another value unlock. Cohen's involvement still a mystery but has potential value unlock with the e-commerce scene.

Reduced opex and overhead by a lot. They had to massively trim fat just to survive and get here, which will show very well in YoY comps from 2020/2021.

Too many uninformed ppl focus on the share price when they should focus on the market cap. They did like a 40% share buyback recently.

Also looking at bonds..  GME bonds were trading way under par (70) and now they have since been given a better credit rating and bonds are trading over par value. Shows that the bond market thinks GME is not a default risk anymore. 

Growth is coming. Too many successful shorts over last 5 years are unable to change their opinion and will lose out now that things have changed.",Stonksflyingup,wallstreetbets,221.0

You learn to handle your deltas and probabilities, then occasionally FOMO into something stupid. I started selling options because you can get a lot more mechanical, but I'll buy calls or puts if I start seeing a move that's interesting.

""Gopro. $6.21 ATM and looks to be re testing an inverted HS neckline, same as what just happened to GME. Gopro would make GME look like a walk in thr park with how far it has fallen in comparison.  

OR  

GE. Multiple weekly 40 RSI tests so far. 3m MACD looks like it really wants a double bottom. 2w +2m MACD about to flip bull. Massive monthly indicator divergences and recent oversold rejections. Numerous reversal candles in a row especially on monthly+ time frames. Also very high volume. This is *potentially* a long term POWER BOTTOM so could take a few months. Gopro is time sensitive. Keep in mind this doesn't incorporate fundamentals but I believe both of these stocks, especially GE after dumping coal, to be severely undervalued.""

He's going to have GME buy out G2A and create a marketplace for game keys, replacing GME's outdated used game sales and simultaneously making it an Amazon-esque storefront for gaming.  All of this will happen before 2022.  GME's stock price will hit $100, he'll sell his stake and leave for whatever next value pick he can find and transform.

Reading instable yahoo finance financial statistics said as of aug 12 there was like ~60mil shares short (you guys were yelling about the 110%+ float but not the amount...) and the volume for yesterday was 65 mil. 30 mil traded those first ten minutes which were some (probably half) shorts forced to buy and the others waiting it out hoping it goes down more. It inched to a low 11.1 in the next thirty minutes and then the rest realized thats bottom so they are forced to rebuy it up to 13.5-.8 where it ended the day. That was another 20-30 mil share volume. This was the last two hours of yesterday. Low and behold AH was up 5% to 14.5 so ya im getting ideas now. So many forced to buy at 11, drived it up to 13, volatility window here because those shorts that got forced to buy want to try to resell higher to make up for losses. But now everyone thinks that, so I was watching today for a rejecting closer to 15 and now the pool of the vast majority of parties have 11.5-12 range to pray on.

Yesterday seems to have broken it, stopped updating a half hour before close.  Its not 100% accurate, but if major short positions were covering it would definitely show.

And with how shorted it is, a squeeze would cause multiple circuit breakers.  I would start selling off a bit at a time each time it started to plateau a little bit.  It is hard to put a target on it as no one has ever seen anything like this.  I probably wouldn't close out totally unless it was dropping seriously or over 75.

Wissink said the news is a net positive to her thesis, as it embeds three coincident events: GameStop's planned implementation of Microsoft's back office systems, rollout of Microsoft's Surface and mobile tech across GameStop stores, and a revenue sharing agreement for Xbox digital sub value over the lifecycle of the customer.

The employees are generally more knowledgeable about games because that‚Äôs the sole focus of the store when compared to Walmart and Best Buy.  I‚Äôve had blank stares at both Big Box stores when asking for something specific.

Those numbers don't make any sense, so I am wondering: do you have 1950 contracts at 1.1953 average ($233,086.26) like the image shows or 1950 contracts at \~.90 average (\~$175,500) and the image is just wrong?

If GME opens a bit under 12 and IV drops only slightly, then those contracts will be worth around .50 a piece ($97,500) at open and could easily cover a .30 range in the first minute of trading. 

What I would do is look over the last 30 or so days of 1m charts and think about how I would manage the trade in each situation. Set some limit orders now because any spike of IV or underlying price could save your ass.

2. You have 2 days of Theta eating away at the value over the weekend and only 1 week before they go to 0. You're more likely to be sitting at around .40-.45.
3. Your IV is going down since it's reversing the original pump over the last week/month.

163,2020-10-10,"&gt;The customer data list is the real value. Free marketing to millions of gamers which is where Microsoft saw value

This point is one I find a little doubtful. Yes Gamestop has that list but at the same time Microsoft has its own list of Xbox (and some PC) gamers. It's almost certain that when it comes to Xbox usage Microsoft's own data is a lot more comprehensive than Gamestop's. You could argue that users != buyers, but at the end of the day it's still the end-users who are influencing/driving a lot of the purchasing decisions. 

So if Xbox data is redundant then what else is useful from Gamestop's data? They'd primarily have Nintendo and Sony customer data but IMO those have less value. Microsoft could potentially convert some Nintendo and Sony users to Xbox, but console-loyalists usually stay on their own platform unless they find another console-exclusive really enticing. With cross-platform play and Microsoft's expansion into PC gaming that argument weakens. Microsoft's game studio acquisitions do allow them to pump out more exclusives but I highly doubt Gamestop plays a huge role/synergy with this either. 

At the end of the day I see GME and MSFT as more akin to a Nikola-GM partnership. I don't disagree that Gamestop will benefit from Microsoft's help in modernization and cost-cutting, but I doubt that Gamestop will accomplish a hard pivot solely from it.",bigchungusmode96,wallstreetbets,163.0

334,2020-10-10,"So much has changed since that article's publication. Here's a few examples.

Starting with debt. Originally this was the reason people thought GME was going bankrupt, 400M in debt and not enough cash on hand. They have restructured their debt and moved over 50% out to 2023. The bond notes have traded from 70 (essentially junk bonds) to now over par value of 100. The company has had its credit score raised and investors in the debt believe that default risk is essentially off the table.

Strong balance sheet. The company has sold off a lot of assets to increase Cash to almost $800MM (a little over $12/share). Inventory has been scaled back and they have less undervalued goods sitting on their books. They have also reduced opex / SG&amp;A by ~27% just to survive. This will reflect in YoY comps 2020/2021 and take people by surprise, similar to how junior miners have to scale back spending in down turns and then when the cycle expands they see huge % changes. SNE has said they will sell more PS5 units in 5 years than they did PS4 units in 7 years. GME sold out of its console pre-order instantly with many of them being bundles (high attach rate = higher margins). GME is adding PC hardware (high margins) to its list of inventories (not priced in yet) since we dont know what the end result will be.

40% share buyback done as well which will alter the share price moving forward. You have to judge its value based on mrkt cap, not the share price. 

People:

Nintendo Reggie has joined GME. He has a wealth of industry knowledge and is a huge person of influence for GME to have on their side. He isnt going to join a cigar butt company.

Cohen brings an interesting ? to the situation. Nobody truly knows the value he brings, but he was producing value to shareholders just with his 13D and he has their support. If he joins GME and does anything remotely as successful as CHWY, then GME share price will rise.

Video game TAM is growing YoY, now over $200bn. GME needs a small piece of that pie, which it will get because they are the only specialized gaming retail. GME had 8bn in rev in 2017-2018, with a dip last year (end of console cycle) to 5+bn. In 2021 they should be closer to 8-10bn. They are currently trading at a p/s of 0.16 (bestbuy for comparison trades at 0.7 w/ $30bn mrkt cap, also B&amp;M).

If I were you I'd personally pull a substantial amount out on Monday. Probably do a limit sell to try to take $50-60k out. Let the rest ride.

There's a good chance this thing IS going to pop IMO. The short selling has been INSANE. It INCREASED Thursday and Friday. However, it's hard to know exactly when and HOW that is going to play out IMO. You DEFINITELY shouldn't have bought 10/16C, 10/23 at earliest or probably early Nov would have been better. 

I know it sucks looking at this kind of thing day to day when you have losses, but you get used to paper losses. The important thing is to try not to REALIZE those losses. Because 10/16 is so soon, it may be difficult not to realize some loss. But you can treat this as a learning experience. With the amount of capital you have left, you have a LOT of room to make back what you lost and make it back fairly rapidly. You just need to learn how to play and this is a good learning experience. Expensive but not even as expensive as it COULD have been.

If I were you, I'd pull some out, let the rest ride, and start to follow _multiple sources_ and find people who seem to be giving reasonable thinking on the market. A good play for this type of situation would have been to buy longer dated calls (expiring early Nov at the earliest probably) and then I would probably (in the future) buy shorter dated puts when the stock is getting frothy but volume has declined a lot and perhaps volatility is down some ideally so the options are less expensive. If you watched volume on Friday morning, it was INTENSE for the first few hours but petered way the hell out and there was just bleeding the rest of the afternoon.

Honestly, you could also watch the movie ""The Big Short"" (note that Burry is an investor in GME) and watch the characters in that movie experience their moments of doubt. You're not the first one to lose a lot of money on paper very quickly, but those losses can quickly turn into large profits too. That's a fundamental feature of this kind of speculation. If you don't have the personality or patience for it though, just get out with what you have and don't gamble in the future.

Edit: NEVER make bets with money you cannot afford to lose. You could have taken 10% of this money and used that to play if you really had the FOMO itch but this is fairly important money to you.",AFreshTramontana,wallstreetbets,352.0

Anyways I won't argue that GME has a lot of work to do, but they have a much better management that years prior and the turn around plan is clearly underway. I think they have a place in the future and won't die off. 

Nobody is assigning any value to what GME could potentially become, but instead they are assigning $0 value based on what GME HAS been.

There is no liquidity issue for shorts. 75m of shares changed hands on Friday, for a short squeeze you need no sellers and lots of shorts desperate to buy to cover their short position. I do not understand the rationale of people saying it will squeeze now. There is no shortage of sellers of GME so where is the pressure going to come from.

And before anyone says there were 44m more shares shorted on Friday, that‚Äôs great but none of them are underwater. The new shorts shorted at like $13 per share so they have plenty of gas in the tank to take some pain from moderate movements upwards, is that even happens.

403,2020-10-10,"First, look at their income statements from previous years. Head to the SEC website and check it out. 8-10b is a rough estimate for 2021, but I think it to be fair. GME did 8bn rev in 2017 and 2018, dipping slightly to 5.X bn in 2019. Consoles are low margin and not the main revenue driver. They sell more than just consoles. Core sales are from games, collectibles, trade in, hardware, etc all with much higher margins. Also the expansion into PC hardware will give them a boost in rev moving forward.

Looks like your console revenue and units sold figures are off. You're really going to give GME $15 in revenue per console sold and call that generous? I think thats a bit discounted.

Sony has already said it will sell more ps5 in 5 years than it did ps4 in 7 years. Units sold YoY will be higher this console cycle. If GME has a good attach rate then they will see a big jump in revenue and the YoY comps from 2020/2021 will look fantastic and surprise people.",Stonksflyingup,wallstreetbets,403.0

Firms that can't buy &lt;$1bn MC companies have been drooling over GME, just waiting for it to hit the mark. $15.45 finally hits - the firms buy en-masse, share over share.

Multiple analysts instantly hit the record with upgrades and positive news articles. GME is re-rated as an e-commerce tech company and starts trading on multiples of sales. The stock price spikes to over $100 and vaporizes short sellers. Zero shares are available. Margin calls everywhere. Firms set their sell prices at $500/share as shorts scramble to cover.

Ryan Cohen moves to take a majority stake in the company, forcing a vote and causing shares be recalled.

Michael Burry makes a similar move or announces he is no longer lending shares.

Another company like Sony/Nintendo partners with GME.

GME shifts focus to online sales with stores acting more as holding centers and display.

GME could also announce preorder numbers and high expected profits.

Hoping it happens sooner than this, but better than expected earnings would also serve as a catalyst.

109,2020-10-11,"&gt;So they bought 4%-10% of the company, but since they didn‚Äôt ‚ÄúAll in‚Äù it means they don‚Äôt believe in its future?

Materiality matters. Timing matters. Burry didn't just buy GME so that's a huge point of contention; Scion bought it years ago and likely has moved on from the investment itself which is why they probably went no further than a little under 5%, there's accounting reasons for this, it isn't an accident.

Cohen just entered the fray and did so at such a low price going into a huge known spike. Again, the timing isn't random, and GME is going to catch a lot of eyes just because of the consoles so this gives him a platform to attempt to basically perform a coup. Okay, that's fine, but the materiality?

Zero. You can ask yourself the most basic question which is, ""What happens to these individuals if GME goes to $0?"" Well, for Scion, they've lost well over 50% of the value, presuming no puts and other instruments to offset, so clearly Scion isn't losing sleep and likely doesn't care too much meanwhile Cohen would be out some money but not enough to impact his lifestyle at all. It almost seems like a pet project but that's me projecting onto him and that's not something I'm here to do. 

What I can say with confidence though is that neither of these funds dies on the vine if GME does and that's even if it went straight to zero and they couldn't exit. As it stands Cohen can exit with money in his pocket if GME refuses by just withdrawing; he's already ""won"" this particular situation and if he's got options as puts in the case they do refuse him he's doubled up and made millions more.

Basically the way to play this out is endless but it's not crazy to see a way out of these things or to see them as immaterial. I mean esp. Burry is not particularly well known for being an advocate *for* GME at all, rather, he just didn't want Hestia doing it's thing to GME and molesting it to death because functionally he likely shares the opinion I do that Hestia is not what GME needed albeit I am not certain Cohen is.

&gt;I give you credit for watering down your nonsenses by stretching them out in hopes that they sound less dumb, but it isn‚Äôt working!

Well, it's okay that you know very little of business, the history of how these things work, etc. I don't expect much of most people outside the field, but ultimately, you haven't actually said anything that makes what you believe any truer. Probably because you're not actually thinking like a business person (and definitely not like PE or VC) where you know that there will be failures in the game.

**When the next consoles come out**

&gt; The problem is that the cycles are extremely long and actually unpredictable. We don't know when the next game console will come out.

Nov. 10 and 12 for XBox Series X and PS5, respectively.

**No one knew about the Xbox One / PS4 specs before the consoles were released**

&gt; If it's pre-orders that fund sales then it definitely can't be weak specs that kill them because no one knew about them before release.

This is a response to my comment that the last console cycle was a weak one because the console specs were relatively poor. DividendWin said that no one knew about the specs beforehand. LOL. It's easy to Google and find articles like [this](https://www.extremetech.com/gaming/148974-ps4-hardware-specs-analyzed-a-big-upgrade-but-ultimately-underwhelming)

**GME spiked on 9/1 because of the new console cycle**
&gt; The spike (which is a run basically) started on Sept 1.

The ""spike"" you saw on Sept. 1 actually started in Aug. 28 AH when Ryan Cohen filed his 13D.

&gt; Cohen filed the 13D on August 18th.

He signed and filed it on August 28th. The 18th was the event that gave him 10 days to file the 13D.

* The phrase refers to the market's ability to show resilience in the face of economic or corporate news that might otherwise spark a selloff, and instead keep pushing securities higher.
*  Market pundits do their part by issuing warnings about everything that could possibly go wrong with the economy, the markets, and most leading stocks
*  The markets' ability to climb a wall of worry reflects investor confidence that these issues will be resolved at some point. However, market direction once the wall of worry has been surmounted is impossible to ascertain and depends on the stage of the economic cycle at which it occurs

163,2020-10-11,"&gt;First off. I've been in GME before the hype. I did both sides of the analysis. My post history can even confirm that.

I will never look through someone's post history to check if they were talking about something a few months (if that) prior regarding a 4 year old issue with a massive 2 year total loss of value. I'll just take your word for it.

&gt;You can bet on the person. Companies bring in new board members all the time to help with turn arounds and strategic improvements when struggling. You don't think if Elon Musk or Tim Cook were to get involved with another company in a similar industry to their expertise, that wouldn't make a splash on the equity price? What a ludicrous thing to say.

I would never ever buy GME because Elon Musk was the CEO. Elon Musk is a technologist, he is great with engineering projects, but GME isn't an engineering firm and doesn't need a great technologist. Tim Cook is an amazing businessman, absolutely shit at innovation, but great at business; the stock rose under his watch because of business maneuvers but not because Apple is doing anything new or fresh in comparison to under Steve Jobs who was great at innovation but not business. But GME doesn't need someone with great business savvy who inherited a global product line and just needed to rearrange the accounts and get the investors what they need. GME needs a different hero. GME needs a product. GME doesn't need a brand, we all know what it is, it doesn't need a brilliant rearranging of accounts because it's got all cash and absolutely no R&amp;D to rearrange as it's a linear business model, it doesn't require anyone with a new special console because it's not only way too late but entering into that war is costly (more than they have for certain) and fundamentally pointless since it would encourage it's B2C to not play with them anymore. 

You see, the tragedy is this: I do not buy things based on hype. I know who Cohen *is not*. They don't need a brand so they don't need Cohen. They don't need customer service so they don't need Cohen. They don't need 24/7 access or ridiculous retail support so they don't need Cohen. Those are the things that Cohen sold, a love of pets, customer service and support and a branding in an area that was relatively overlooked. Cohen is not the hero GME needs because Cohen is not a product king; he doesn't reinvent the wheel at all and GME needs complete reinvention. And on top of this, all this, he's not even on the board. This is all worthless speculation.

&gt;Smart money equals Cohen. He's been in the e-commerce business and has been successful. You're right on one thing, Cohen is not an investor. That means his money is staying in GME and he has plans, Bloomberg even highlighted that last month. I'm betting he succeeds again.

Yeah, I don't know if you understand that he's not going to succeed because his plans aren't really going to be fresh, original and not already dominated to death by the market that already exists. No offense but he's run 1 business, just 1, from the ground up with a buddy (Day), and he wasn't funded or backed by Series A for 3 years so to understand that he scaled up and sold within 3 years time; that's not good for the hero you need him to be. On top of this he's not on the board so ... he has absolutely no real power. He can vote his own propositions in but he's amorphous. 

Still, somehow I assume you're referring to him simply ( https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/gamestop-surges-on-investor-ryan-cohen-plan-to-rival-amazon ) turning it into a dropshipping company. Yeah, no, that's not going to happen. I have no idea why anyone is pandering to this idea that it is actually a good one. Are you going to buy your next blender from **GAMESTOP**? I'm sorry, but seriously, why? I'm also saying that there are no concrete plans to do this at all; nothing exists, no infrastructure at all, to support this idea. It's just an idea at the moment and that's not good enough. 

You really need a history lesson (not just on Cohen, business) to understand what GME is up against. It's not merely a matter of some guy walking in and voila. By the way,

&gt;Im already up over 100% on commons, I have Cohen buying in way above my avg price. I've already won this trade.

That would make him the sucker. In a zero-sum game (not that stocks are, but let's not discuss that) you basically are selling to this guy something worth dirt because you bought it for substantially less *and* nothing fundamentally meaningful has happened. RC Ventures can't actually do anything so it's nothing more than begging at this point. I mean if he wants to polish the turd, hey, you still won, and ... I don't know if that speaks highly of him. For what it is worth he's only VC in this that deep. The only one. *cough*

&gt;You seem to be very emotional here and I think that's because your position is going against you and you can't explain it even though it's obvious that GME price would rise.

Actually you seem to be the emotional one. You're constantly arguing on absolute air. I mean literally nothing you've said actually gives a strong reason why GME will succeed. You may as well have said, ""Because I want it to and I like that guy!"" of which you know absolutely nothing about.

I guarantee you it isn't proportionate; the cost of the sub-business is not something you're considering and that's a major problem. You have a store that's theoretically going from just games, which isn't working, to games and culture, which also isn't working because the culture knows that GME is a bad deal; we joked about it for years that if you went to Gamestop you could buy Crash Bandicoot (the first one; I was there... I feel old) for $20 and sell it for $.20. And that was back when it was popular and meaningful to swap discs and there were no competitors, really, other than maybe Babbages which bit the dust way sooner.

So yeah, again, how are they going to penetrate a market with a bad rep, no product of their own, mild (at best) branding, and a complete cadre of opponents who own that market hands down? It's almost a joke. Nothing wrong with having a share of a multi-trillion dollar industry but they aren't anything in there and the expansion, in my opinion, is a failure. The rate of growth for that is too low relative to the costs to run such a thing.

For point 3 consoles ""are your good news"". There's nothing else. That's it. Maybe there will be other tidbits but this is the cycle.

If this isn't a classic pump and dump I don't know what else to say.

Think about it, usually when this enters the fray:

&gt;I like the people involved with GME. Its sometimes best to bet on the people and not the company itself.

It's flat out hysteria. I will tell you the truth: You are not buying those people. You are not buying their opinions. You are not buying their strategies. You are not buying their (insider) knowledge. You are buying the company. If your investment strategy is betting on anything but the company you are fucked. 

&gt;I'm going to continue following the smart money and focus on FCF and mrkt cap. The dumb money will stay focused on the share price.

*Who is the smart money here?* That's the problem. In all of these discussions not a single person has ever shown who the ""smart money"" is. Not one. There are no major backers. There are institutional investors but most of them own less than 5% (and that's *not* an accident) and the general reality is that those institutions *backed out*. The ""smart money"" *left years ago*.

So where is your smart money? I mean, in the literal sense, you've basically stated that you wouldn't have looked at it at all but now somehow the smart money, which is really just a swarm of Twitter feeds and WSB kids, is in there? Cohen isn't an investor, he's not an II, so he definitely isn't ""smart money"".

This alone should raise some concerns if Cohen is in this for the long-haul. Why would he stop at 9.96% ownership?

As for cash-on hand. They do have $735M of cash, but also $197M in current (&lt;1 year) debt and $219M in current (&lt;1 year) leases. Couple that with $215M in long-term debt and $476M in long-term leases. This feels like they are going to try to preserve cash / liquidity as much as possible. I do agree that console cycle should hopefully be a cash-generating opportunity for them. However, if you look back at the 2014 console cycle - the two quarters of CF for quarter ended Oct 31 2013 and Jan 31 2014 (when the PS4 and Xbox One were released), GME only generated \~$850M in operating CF.

Sentiment has undeniably shifted.
Months ago nobody mentioned GME and the few who did were called idiots. Judging by the recent support from WSB/twitter/ST with bulls out of nowhere, I'd say sentiment is rapidly changing to the positive. The price controls the narrative. If it keeps rising, positive sentiment will rise with it.

* One of the somewhat major revenue streams for them are collectibles (almost 1bn$ in 2019). I know it's not substantial, but again, they're trying to turn the company around so they *might* come up with something more

* By your definition I am also a bear as I am not hoping for a company's long-term success. The play's time horizon here is January (April at the very best).

Why anyone tries to make it out for more than this is beyond me. Even as a ""bear"" I, of course, bought calls to see this rise in November/December because fucking duh.

There is no ""edge"" here. We all agree literally that this company is dead. You just wrote a lot of words to say, ""Yeah, it's a pump and dump."" That's public info.

&gt;The following year or two after the consoles release are going to be explosive as it has been every time before, which is also enough time for management to come up with new ways for a company to live besides selling games and consoles.

Look at any chart, hasn't lasted 2 years. In fact that's one of the reasons why it's such a horrible bet; the pre-post level prices adjust back within 8 months both times with the initial console release holding the longest at a steady price but ultimately technological collapsed that plus the fact that company didn't actually *do* anything with the money it has. It's like you sitting upon a heap of a trillion dollars and letting it rot. There's no return on capital deployed because there's no capital deployed.

&gt;Michael Burry involvement is also a somewhat convincing argument.

Yeah, why? Not a, ""you don't know who that is?"" type of statement either; you have to actually explain why that matters. Most investors who are well known got it wrong 99 times and right 1. And all it takes is that 1. Does this guy know games? Is he the future of console functions? Do we even have an expertise for him? Regardless of his connections or his DCF model does he actually *know* what he's doing?

I mean basically Burry stated that Cohen was *not* necessary:

&gt;Burry also pointed out that the company has nominated three new board members, all with video game or omnichannel experience. Adding a dig at Permit and Hestia at the end, Burry said he doesn't think GameStop's board needs individuals who will ""disrupt and detract"" from GameStop's current strategy.

[Support](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/05/gamestops-new-management-wins-over-michael-burry-o.aspx)

While Scion owns like 5% or something I don't think they'll balls to the wall in to make the company come back to life. They don't care at all. Basically Permit and Hestia, two hedges, both think that the stock sucks because it fell 85% and they wanted to take over and fix it. The hero you're now trumpeting (Cohen) is basically Permit and Hestia that the shareholders *rejected including Burry.*

Basically it just comes down to looking at the facts. None of these things align with this being a ""good idea"" outside of the known spike. There's no shame in that by the way but this case is extraordinarily weak because the people you're alluding to tended against your own argumentation or were not strong candidates to begin with. Cohen knows nothing about gaming at all let along the industry and has been a CEO in a totally different industry where he lead a company as a sole proprietor versus a corporate conglomerate and Burry was like, ""Fuck it, so what it's down 85%, it's a good strategy!""

Yeah, for PUTS. You might want to check to see if Scion wrote any against them.

&gt;You are seriously telling me that a market cap of 700m$ is adequate for a company which generated 6.5b$ revenue in 2019, having 2.3b$ in assets and 700m$ with cash on hands?

This means you don't know what you're buying. Gamestop doesn't *produce* anything. The market cap here is not equivalent to a market cap for a service function or such; in fact that's part of the reason why everyone has no faith in it; to assess that there's some magic number to this valuation and that it doesn't come from the fact that it is a non-producing B2C company that essentially sells outdated products is to ignore the main problem with the company itself. Yes, the market cap *is* correct when the cycle *isn't* in their favor. That's the problem. And if you note console cycles get longer and worse, not shorter and better, so GME living between the two off of little scraps of bread is not going to last long.

Having a lot of cash is not an indication of actually generating anything, a lot of revenue can be a sign of artificial nature (that is, you can sell a bunch of shit, and still have overwhelming expenses to offset; revenue is not net income) and the cash is equivalent to the market cap which is actually a bad sign because it means that they aren't generating anything. To put this into simpler terms by dropping zeros you sold 6,500 worth of stuff and kept 700 (not at all working capital) so a return of about 11%? You are underwater.

&gt;Yes, in percentages. But you should also account for the overall growth of the gaming market, and an argument can be made that total numbers are not decreasing that much.

I'm going to put a nail in this coffin by actually discussing another major problem: Gamestop has no alternative revenue. None. It doesn't matter actually even if the physical disc thing wasn't murdering it because there are two factors that impact this. The first is that GME has to buy the discs to sell the discs which gives it an inventory problem and the second is that GME, with no alternative market entry points that is way too late to take on Valve or any other portal, has no offset to this expenditure alone.

What then occurs is the fact that GME works like a swap shop but the problem is that the intrinsic value of the disc is greatly diminished by being used; they can't sell and resell the same thing forever for the same price and in the past the notion was that you sold, resold, and resold the resell as people played a game and swapped it out but then you had other companies show up with ideas that sort of undid this, one of them not even mentioned but actually exists still, is *Gamefly*. Gamefly fucks that shit to hell. You can keep the game for as long as you want, buy it if you want to, return it if you want to, actually as far as I know you can borrow hardware from them, and so forth and so on. The fact that it comes to your door, etc. is a problem.

You are not talking about a system that is facing *only* digital competition. The notion that there is no *Physical* competition is incorrect. There is. There is actually a lot of it and they do it so much better than Gamestop is already and have been for over a decade. The assessments regarding the issue of digitization are short-sighted; even to look only at the physical swapping you've got a real market that is crushingly present ranging from Facebook peer-to-peer selling to Gamefly and other services which do the job just as well for a very low monthly fee that completely undermines buying the game itself even if you were physical only.

So this also holds zero water.

TL;DR: I am fucking sorry *but the company is dead and you have to live with it.* Benjamin Graham called this a Cigar Butt Company and that is what it is; you're going to get this last puff and then ... yeah, it's fucking garbage.

154,2020-10-12,"I figure the absolute floor is Cohens latest buy in @ 8.6 which is way above my cost basis. A lot of early bulls are enjoying this volatility worry free.

EOY - I expect we have more announcements from partnerships with other vendors and e-commerce updates with figures showing growth. I expect Cohen to show his hand and the BoD come out with a joint statement about his position. I would like to see GME selling Xbox ultimate passes like crazy so they lock in the revenue sharing. A high attach rate this cycle seems like a no-brainer considering people will need hardware like controllers. Hopefully GME can monetize their user database of millions of customers (very valuable to the gaming companies, and there are lots that would pay for the data). FCF will look great over the next few quarters.

179,2020-10-12,"Yes that's right. Add to this that disc drive pre-orders are sold out, and that disc-less memory is limited:

&gt;Games are big, and even today that storage space is limited; the PS5's SSD will reportedly only have 825GB of space. Spider-Man is 53GB. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare is 65GB. Final Fantasy 7 Remake is a whopping 85GB. That adds up fast, and having it on disc instead of needing to download it whenever you want to play it is really useful.

I do think the trend is towards digital, but it isn't tomorrow, next month, or next year. It is at least until the next console cycle.

185,2020-10-12,"I'm confused.  Why are we standing strong against Blackrock and Fidelity?  They both have 15% share positions in GME.

MSFT news wasn't nothing, its pretty important even if it was overblown.  The pre announce halt probably actually added to the hype tbh. It is pretty normal for MSFT partnership news to cause massive jumps.

&amp;#x200B;

All that said, I'm very much on the GME hype train (and have been for a few months).  Thank you for pointing out that people should not buy FDs.   I'm expecting a few more jumps like the ones we've been seeing before we possibly see ""liftoff.""",Ackilles,wallstreetbets,185.0

428,2020-10-12,"exactly, a lot of bearish argument focuses on what has happened, mostly with previous management.  I get people are skeptical and rightly so given how terribly managed it has been,.  The jury is still out on whether sherman and co will be able to turn it around, but if RC takes on a greater role, that means to me at least will be trying to do something big to prevent themselves from dying.  Will they be successful, idk but GME has something that most business that face an existential crisis don't have, an upcoming huge bump in demand for products they sell (console refresh).  They have an opportunity to take some of that rev produced and remake themselves before they become potentially irrelevant.

Whenever I see a bunch of people completely sold on their demise as if it was a 100% probability, a Forbes article on Cohen earlier this year always comes to mind, in particular this blurb:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And the best idea to bet on could be the one that everyone says can‚Äôt possibly succeed.

&gt;‚ÄúWhenever there‚Äôs a lot of skepticism, it usually means there‚Äôs a lot of white space.

23,2020-11-07,"I think there is a bit of miscommunication here.  I'm not talking about people selling their PS4 when they buy the PS5.  What I'm saying, is that next week, people will sell their PS5s to gamestop as used.  Yes, the ones they got in preorder and paid a lot of money for, they will start selling them to GME for half of what they paid.

&amp;#x200B;

Do I know why? No, but it happens.  It won't be a ton next week, but it will happen, and it will gradually increase in volume over the next couple of weeks/months until it becomes a meaningful revenue number.

&amp;#x200B;

Unrelated little bit of fun.  I'm sure you've seen the stock price charts around the previous console cycles.  There were 100 mill shares outstanding for those cycles, only 65 million now.  If it were to go back to similar market caps, The stock would have to runnup much, much further than where it did before.

25,2020-11-07,"None of it matters since GME doesn't set the price. Microsoft and Sony does. GME is not gonna start charging 1000 bucks for the new consoles all of a sudden. Their profit per new console is fixed. So only way they make more money is by selling more of them. 

And as for the old last gen consoles. Supplies for them are not limited. There are plenty new old gen consoles out there for anyone to buy. The reason people usually sell their old consoles when the new ones come out is because of two things: 1. They bought the new console or 2. GME usually does a promotion of giving you extra credit towards the new console. 

So I don't know how you get to people gonna sell their old console to GME without getting a new consoles and than gonna buy the old used consoles from GME at new console retail price. 

I would say there is no correlations between the supply of new next gen consoles to the sell/demand of the old used last gen consoles. Sure some parents might go and buy a new xbox one X because the series X is sold out but that's completely because of Microsoft's stupidity in naming their consoles.",superbit415,wallstreetbets,25.0

In fact that was one of the most interesting things about this particular overview that I did. Remember that these were the most popular stocks so in turn these weren't stocks that were obscure, hard to know, hard to find, unspoken, or otherwise which is what is interesting me so much in the idea. 

The fact of the matter is that exuberance seems extremely high so indices that track these, contain these, or the securities themselves are almost pouring themselves out to the public. I made money on NIO for instance today and bet on it yesterday long after the run-up and still doubled in pre $42. It's just basically a lot of signaling in this market appears to be very transparent because you're correct that in the normal play of the game signals are usually harder to understand or garbled and nonsensical where things don't generally flow in one single way.",Everyman_B,wallstreetbets,37.0

40,2020-11-06,"I was thinking about this too and I was trying to figure out which method is best because if you risk less you stay in the account longer but at the same time you run more rolls of the dice and the more rolls you take the lower your odds of success due to reversion to the mean in theory. Not that I understand it all well enough to put it into a sound paper or anything but basically I thought you would do better trying to make large bets than you would small bets. I think there was a GME guy here who bet 100k into options of some sort that I read about lurking and he is part of the reason why I got to thinking about it. In one trade he became a millionaire and the risk level for that trade was much lower than anything I'd have ever seen because the stock was at the bottom and the odds of failure were pretty low insofar as it going against him though odds of it going in his favor was high. While I don't understand video game consoles well I guess he would have won that bet no matter what so it was a good bet.

In a sense thats where I am coming from I think where larger bets with more researched and certain outcomes would do better than smaller bets even if the same research is applied simply based on the number of bets total. I guess it just seems counterintuitive to do.

That is the video I think I got it from at about an hour in.

59,2020-11-06,"Wall street expectations for gamestop are bottom of the barrel.  They still think its going bankrupt soon.  Normally this would be their worst earnings of the console cycle, but the last one had forced store closures.  I'm thinking we see better numbers this quarter. And better than worst will be a surprise.

That said, I've been saying for months that I expect the stock to drop on EPS posting for Decembers ER, but I expect a huge rally during the call.  They will absolutely talk about console presales and interest.  That itself is pretty bullish.  They're sold out of preorders and will continue to be even after the next batch drops.

This will also be a great time to talk about other activities.  Is Cohen taking an active roll in the turnaround?  He is still invested, so this is still very feasible, and an official announcement that he is actively involved would be good for at least +2-3 bucks tacked onto the stock price.

Talking about continued increase in website sales and how people are responding to the massive improvements is also a likely topic.  If they don't bring up the MSFT deal, there will absolutely be questions from investors about it.  If they start forward guidance again, we could see crazy movement on that as well.


Finally, and rather amusingly, a lack of console supply is actually bullish for GME.  People start selling used consoles to gamestop starting the day they release.  Why?  I can't fathom a legitimate reason for this, but it happens.  Super demand and no supply means people will pay new console prices for used consoles.  There will be a massive profit margin on these for gamestop, and even better, when the console is an XBox, that console starts generating passive revenue for them as well.",Ackilles,wallstreetbets,59.0

40,2020-11-07,"Totally understood it was just for illustration.

Somebody else mentioned OSTK which is a meme stock hence has high volatility

A real life example is GME where I have a nice sized position.  I obtain 3.5% on the long side of the strangle for a 15% above underlying stock price shorted call.  I obtain 2.8% per month on the short side of the strangle for a shorted put (I want to be an owner if my puts are assigned).  

This was for a trade when GME was at 12.8 put in about 2 weeks ago on the Dec monthly.  GME tanked to 10.5 but I was paid 6.3% just to hold GME for that month.  Plus I allowed my broker (IB) to lend out GME thus earning some interest on the hypothecated shares.  Haven't checked my statements but its approx 2.5% for that month.    Thus my total notional cap loss (21% ugh) is offset by 8.8% income for that month.

Annualized; if GME paid out such outrageous premiums every month (unlikely) I will own free shares in a little less than a year.  The risk is of course that GME's share price tanks to near zero but that's a risk I'm willing to take and while I take that risk I'm compensated for it by the option premium income generated from the strangle",team_ti,wallstreetbets,40.0

Ecommerce will help GME get a much fairer p/s multiple that could send the price to triple digits after 2021 FY.

GME was priced for bankruptcy. They will not go bankrupt. Their bond pricing made that clear when it jumped from 70 to par. When i bought GME at $6 i realized they were trading at 50% less than what they had per share in cash alone. Vastly undervalued. Market ascribed $0 value to the company and its brand. Turned out to be an easy 100% gain which only took a few weeks.  Now it looks like it might be a 10x and more if I keep holding.

GME is very unique. I don't understand how the 100+% short interest can possibly close without a BIG move to the upside, whether it take a few days or a few months. The business is in a good spot, management is competent. Bankruptcy is off the table and they should be generating a profit from now on. 

Looking for Q3 ER as a potential catalyst. EPS estimates are low at an avg of  -0.85 and I think GME will beat expectations simply due to their e-commerce growth over the last few months. Everyone else in the industry is doing exceptionally well. Hardware/software/publishers all crushing earnings across the board. I think management has a lot of topics to focus on which will highlight a successful business model moving forward. I also think a return to profitability by Q4 ER is easily attainable, which should force the smarter shorts to capitulate on their thesis of a continual operating loss till bankruptcy.",Stonksflyingup,wallstreetbets,51.0

72,2020-11-08,"What kind of price-to-sales multiple will GME have in the next 2 years? Currently at 0.13

If GME successfully grows their e-commerce business to \~50% with same day delivery (currently being rolled out now), the products they sell could reasonably provide a 1x sales multiple. (Compare other e-commerce P/S - OSTK 1.2   CHWY 4.2)

4 new revenue streams for GME will include: Monetization of customer data, digital downstream revenue from MSFT Xbox platform, online advertising revenue, and PC hardware sales. All 4 offer good margins.

All of these new revenue streams and e-commerce growth represents a very big change (almost 'tech' like) than that of the former business model of purely B&amp;M with mostly just gaming product inventory. The real big money to influence a major share price rise is in the customer data. If leveraged properly, GME has a true 'tech' side to their business model.

GME looks to grow revenue YoY, estimating 6-7bn for 2021, and 8bn+ in 2022 with a P/S of 1, we are looking at a 8bn market cap in 2022. Share price of $120+

You could compare with BestBuy, which has a P/S of 0.8. Give GME the 0.8 P/S and they reach a market cap of 6.4bn (assuming 8bn yearly revenue in 2022). That's $99/share and an 800% increase from current market value.

Most investors are not aware of what the company has to offer, hence why the reference Blockbuster so much. There is a reason we have seen larger stakes being taken by bigger players. Just last week we saw some more big boys jumping in. Wells Fargo, Jefferies, Hussman all taking positions. When GME shorts flip to longs (will happen eventually) they will drive up the share price.

In the next 2 years, if the street decides to view GME as a e-commerce/digital data business within the gaming/PC industry, valuations can run high and P/S multiples could run even higher.",Stonksflyingup,wallstreetbets,72.0

8,2020-11-11," GME liquidated inventory last quarter without replenishment, which makes sense ahead of the new console cycle. However, it is clear that they will need to use cash in order to replace inventory with the newer products that are about to release.

So why would they redeem a huge chunk ($125M) so early? It is a crucial time for liquidity.

This only leads me to 3 possible conclusions, and I'd like to know if you think I am missing something.

They decided to redeem $125M in SPITE of the fact that they clearly need to use cash to replenish inventory ahead of the new console cycle.

Therefore, management either 1) knows that that the current 3Q quarter will produce positive FCF, 2) extremely confident about 4Q numbers, or 3) are flaming idiots.

While 3) is possible, I'd like to think 1) or 2) is more reasonable here.",Boostafazoom,wallstreetbets,8.0

8 out of 9 analysts rate SPCE a buy. It was an unheard of 8 out of 8 until Goldman Sachs decided to rate it neutral, in late October and ruin the party. Odd timing right?

SPCE is the second most shorted stock on the Street (after GME) and shorts are currently paying 9% interest to maintain their positions. 

This is building up to what will invariably be a short squeeze of biblical proportions as SPCE will be making history in literally 10 days! This 3rd successful powered flight will likely seal the deal for their FAA COMMERCIAL SPACE LICENSE! This will also be the first human space flight in the history of New Mexico!

21,2020-11-11,"You don't understand the business model. This isn't the same company moving forward.

It seems that you're hung up on video game sales and that doesn't even matter as much anymore. GME will obviously still have physical inventory sales as an integral part of its revenue, but the true vision is becoming more tech-like within the omnichannel retail business model.

This is the key part you are missing:

Monetizing customer data sales to gaming publishers will become a high margin component of the business. Online advertising revenue and downstream digital revenue sharing with gaming partners will keep GME profitable and healthy. These are the business components that you overlooked, or more likely you didn't even know existed.

Cant forget to mention PC hardware sales, a $40bn/year industry. GME will get a piece of that growing TAM.

I will speculate that GME may get involved in used PC hardware, making PC more affordable to lower income consumers, coupled with their BNPL service recently launched. (high margins on this). They are already accepting trade ins for cell phones.

Wrap this all together with an omnichannel business structure that is 50% e-commerce offering same day delivery and you have a winner considering what it is currently valued at (700m MC). Pure value play here. Should be trading with a price-to-sales multiple of 1 within 2 years, generating 8bn+ in yearly revenue. The share price will be at least $100 if management executes properly.

Business turnarounds are common. BestBuy was struggling massively only 6 years ago before commencing an awesome turnaround. They are now valued at $30bn. GME has the potential to be successful.",Stonksflyingup,wallstreetbets,21.0

Problem is though that no one buys consoles anymore in stores when amazon/walmart/direct manufacture sites are cheaper. Add in covid and the most autistic short play I've ever seen.

Either its gonna short squeeze to 60 bucks a share or its gonna crash and burn. Michael Burry already dumped Scions portfolio a good chunk of GME so I dumped mine around the 14 dollar mark. I felt something fishy and got paper hands.

It'll print for free money. I see TSLA being an easy $500 in 2021. So if you are happy with that kind of return and you can get in at that price, go for it.

I think the problem is the big safe stocks like TSLA AMZN NVDA and SPY too they aren't as MEME as your other stocks like NIO GME etc. The returns aren't as wild.

 From the 8-K: ""**Using cash generated from operations**"" (in order to retire the senior notes) 

 GME was able to use cash from operations, during a time when bears thought GME to be at its weakest, the end of 7 year console cycle.  

Why is this important? Well they are most likely cash flow positive NOW and NO console cycle benefits have truly taken place yet.  

GME have not yet generated revenue from monetizing their customer data or from the MSFT downstream digital revenue partnership.  They have only very recently began to generate revenue from PC hardware and online advertising.

147,2020-11-10,"Here is why I am bullish and willing to hold long term.

**Monetization of customer data** \- possible 600M EBITDA if leveraged correctly. Why nobody mentions this is beyond me, arguably one of the most important high margin revenue streams GME can benefit from.

**E-Commerce omnichannel business model** that offers same day delivery and is continually improving. This is the ""beat AMZN' part of the business model.

**PC hardware sales** ($40bn/yr and growing TAM)

**Online ad revenue.** From website + App

**E-sports experiences**. Currently partnering with gaming pros and streaming on twitch. Will **build brand recognition**.

Massive **reduction in SG&amp;A.**

**SKU optimization**. Better inventory and inventory turnover.

'Digital everything' is not as strong of a bear thesis as it was 2 years ago. Especially considering GME has the MSFT partnership to share digital revenue.

Gaming industry TAM is growing YoY.

Competent management team. Finally.

Bigger firms/institutions are taking a position in GME. So far as of end of Q3 we have had new or increased stakes from: Senvent, State Street, Russell, Wells Fargo, Hussman and finally Jefferies taking an sizeable position in Call options.

&amp;#x200B;

This is not a $700MM company. This is not the old GME where you simply buy and trade in videogames. It is very undervalued at current market price of $11

I think GME has potential to be valued at $2-3bn valuation within 12 months ($32-47)

When it finally appreciates in value after a few good quarterly earnings then there should be a slow squeeze. You have to be patient with this play. It will most likely take 6+ months until we see good Q4 and Q1 earnings to convince shorts to capitulate.",Stonksflyingup,wallstreetbets,147.0

62,2020-11-11,"Xbox one release was around nov 23 2013, gme traded around $48. There was a run up from March to oct from 24 to 55ish. 

In Jan 2014 gme dropped to around $34. This year‚Äôs console release is probably priced in. 

It sounds absolutely absurd in believing in this company outside of potential squeeze from console release but I have a different thesis. 

Brick and mortar toys toys are closing down (Toys R Us) and GME has been selling collectibles / toys, basically filling in that gap. I think it may become an e commerce one stop shop for all things nerdy with some physical flagship stores. I need to do DD on gme since I bought in the squeeze hype but I believe that this company may actually be a long hold for the next 2 years. I‚Äôll probably close my calls at a loss and buy leaps in addition to shares. 

Call me autistic (I probably am) but this could be a turning point for a beat down company. Imagine you bought amazon shares when they were trying to transition away from selling books. 

I am also strongly of the opinion that management has prevented the short squeeze because execs all know each other and when you‚Äôre an exec level employee the business has a relationship aspect with bridges you don‚Äôt want to burn. The only catalyst that can cause a short at this point is if more big name hedge funds pile in like what happened with Herbalife fight between Bill and Carl.",mustbepurged,wallstreetbets,62.0

""I don't know anyone that would ..."" ok. good. do you know everyone?

""I work on wall st. btw"" ok. cool story bro.

Gamestop was a solid pick up at the ATLs earlier this year. Anyone who picked up has made a fuck ton of money. It got down as low 2.80$ per share. Console Cycle coming up - more than half of game purchases are through retail/brick and mortar. Even if it doesn't survive the next 10 years GME has a clear path for the coming 2-3 years. I've been deeply following them for over a year - financials/10ks/cash flow/income/balance sheets. There is definitely something salvageable here. Have you seen their board of directors? 

Also...who the fuck clocks other peoples money? especially strangers? You sound like a fucking loser.

tl;dr you sound like you dont know what the fuck you're talking about. Anyone that picked up GME prior to august has at least doubled their investment.",Ski_g,wallstreetbets,70.0

72,2020-11-11,"The chart is misleading. GME shares barely moved during last console release and it actually went down a few months after. This console cycle is different because I suspect management will direct new free cash flow to transform the business. This is what you should be investing in, a badly beaten business looking to make a big comeback. Just imagine if you had the foresight to invest in Amazon when they were selling books. 

I also don‚Äôt think the squeeze is gonna happen anymore, or at least not to the VW levels.

113,2020-11-11,"Why was it not ""priced in"" at the previous console cycle? Why did it continue to rise after release and stayed at very elevated levels for more than a year afterwards? Why is it that, just like previous console cycles, the stock at sitting at the same level it would be at this stage in the cycle (i.e. the beginning)? What makes you think it's gonna be *worse off* this time around, when GameStop is in the execution stage of a massive turnaround and pivot to e-commerce?

The truth is you can't answer these questions and still be so certain that GME is going to fail. Not if you're being honest with yourself, anyway. 

You've been presenting straw man arguments, claiming market sentiment is negative for GME solely on the basis of your own personal opinions and preferences with gaming, and rejecting any possibility that the stock will continue to perform in the near future. I don't think you're ready to have a logical argument about GME because of your own biases.

- are too lazy to get up to put the CD in your console

- assume that people are generally okay with their purchased ""item"" retaining no value whatsoever, even if it's a mere $5

- think everyone, like you, can just go out and buy whatever they want, wherever they want

- think that most people have the internet capabilities to download games rapidly and would prefer it over spending an hour picking up a game

- probably haven't heard that Amazon are having troubles getting preorders out to some customers and won't be able to until December

- are going off of Y-o-Y ""stats"" and placing no value on anything that's happening being the scenes or the fact that GameStop will be one of *the* biggest beneficiaries of this gaming cycle at the very least, which will last 5 years at the very least

0,2020-11-13,"Yeah 30% is a shit ton (profit), as well as whatever the commission is for xbox game pass.  Considering they have a partnership with MSFT and that they are the biggest retail videogame store in the world, its safe to bet they are getting about the same or more than walmart, target,etc.  I have very high hopes for this stock, it should be selling at 15-20 right now (fair price).   he only problem is the market manipulation it is facing because of the large funds with shorts but one piece of good news and this stock is going to mars. 

Also in case you didn't know, 3 days ago gamestop decided to pay 150 mill of debt early ...this is huge. This goes against the narrative that this big hedges have that it will go bankrupt and that they are struggling to make a profit. [https://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2020/11/11/gamestop-debt.html](https://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2020/11/11/gamestop-debt.html)

I dont know about corsair so cant give you my opinion, im personally 5k into GME and im expecting it to go 20 by eoy probably around the 40 in march earnings. I wont tell you what to do but im fairly certain that GME is going to be selling huge with this new console. Even if they don't sell that big, they are still getting 30% out of every xbox. Absolutely insane. They sold out all xbox and ps5s already and a lot demand atm. 

This is also not taking into account the massive short float that can trigger a squeeze at any moment. This can take it even higher. 

Do your own DD if you like and good luck!  BTW if you are seriously thinking of going in, right now with this $10-11 range is the perfect value. It was $9 before MSFT announcement and paid off debt. So im not expecting it to go any lower than this.",loopback123,wallstreetbets,0.0

Which also means store sales down over 40%... digging a little deeper we see hardware sales down 21%, while software sales down 31% GME looks to be more and more where you go to get hardware not software. All this said- management is making cuts, finding new strategy, and trying to run a good business. Sure thing to the moon- fuck no... can they get enough sales from new consoles to hold off their creditors long enough to continue to cut costs drastically to try and get a little profit from online- maybe?

208,2020-12-02,"Good question!

First a nit: If the squeeze happens it means shorts are covering (and hence buying). I presume your question is will a significant squeeze even happen (i.e. expect some sane shorts to start the covering).

Realize that when the squeeze happens it is because the big shorts have decided to exit. These are the ones who have enough assets to potentially weather the high prices. The smaller folks will get killed once the big guys exit. The small fish will get margin called and the brokerage will cover at whatever price they can, resulting in a pretty big squeeze.

Why would the big guys exit?

The bankruptcy thesis of Gamestop is dead. That is what folks are hoping a significant portion of the big shorts will finally realize. If not, there is another alternative for the squeeze to happen (see the last paragraph).

For the near term (next 2-3 years) expect GME to be valued at 2-3 billion. That would give it a share price of $32-$48, keeping the current low PE ratio and that is ignoring things like the game informer magazine, their $1Bn collectibles business and their expansion into PC gaming etc.

The digital killing physical thesis is bust and is only part of the picture for GME.

This is even without considering Ryan Cohen's involvement who has shown a very very active interest in Gamestop. If he pulls off a chewy and delights the huge 55 million+ loyal userbase, who knows what this can be valued at!

So post squeeze we can expect the price to stabilize around at least $50 for a period of 2-3 years at least. Not sure if even the big guys can weather that.

**The alternative:** the shorts could be in a position where they are forced to buy. A simple recall of shares would achieve that. That could happen if Ryan Cohen manages to induce a shareholder vote. That is easily possible given RC's history and the recent letter from RC to the board etc. In fact this is the squeeze trigger I am hoping for, as this one will be one for the record books.",throwawaygaandu,wallstreetbets,208.0

https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/DKS/dicks-sporting-goods/revenue

incredible, considering retail apocalypse and all. makes sense though, since you have to physically try out any equipment you want to buy

i think the key to surviving in retail will be to provide value to customers in a unique way that draws them to the stores, while combining that with a strong online presence

there's also this from the [retail apocalypse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail_apocalypse) wiki:

""IHL found that for each retailer that is closing stores in 2019 more than five retail chains are opening stores, which is up from the 3.7 ratio in 2018. IHL also reported that the number of chains adding stores in 2019 has increased 56%, while the number of closing stores has decreased by 66% in the last year.""

it should be noted that GME is closing between 400 and 450 stores though:

https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/10/investing/gamestop-store-closures/index.html

i've also looked at several stores that are within the ""specialty retail"" group:

https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=121&amp;f=ind_specialtyretail&amp;o=pc

sorted by price-to-cash (P/C). a lot of them had great earnings in the last quarter, and many went up after. GME is the cheapest in the group in terms of P/C ratio, perhaps indicating a degree of upside

further, MIK and BBW have earnings on dec. 3rd

maybe, *maybe*, completely guessing: their earnings might provide an indication of what will happen with GME on dec. 8, ah

2) Cohen risks Management winning over other share holder if they start producing results. It makes it much more harder for share holders to vote for Cohen if current Management is delivering. Why shake things up if you're long and things are going well?

3) Vaccine news helps GME share price. Same thing, Cohen priced out of GME.

Squeeze is fuel to the fire. This is fundamentally a deep value play.

You may not have to agree with all the new strategies. At this point nobody even knows if it's the correct decision.

But outside reddit there are people who may want to go to a store sometimes to meet...real people. Further, it seems silly to be completely pessimistic on a company that does really nothing but gaming. It's such a growth business that I think to suggest there is no room for a retail presence, seems silly.

But I can definitely see their challenge. I've written about them in some detail before. If you go to their website some of their Xbox stuff is digital but none of their PS5 stuff is digital. I'm pretty sure i read some details about that. In any case, it's not quite as urgent as it seems because there are lots of previous generation consoles out there. Yes, GME **must** get digital content for PS5 and subsequent generations. If they don't they're fucking toast. If all the digital content is corralled into PS5 and Xbox walled gardens it's going to be quite bleak for GME.

Short term I like the comps GME is going to have. Their stores are going to be busy selling consoles. And the full curb stomp of COVID next year will give their stores a boost too.

So you sell at least a few days before everybody starts selling..

Do you think it makes sense to let it ride and there's a fairly low probability GME moons past $20 immediately before or after earnings? My cost basis on that lot is $12 so I'd make a profit anyway if the shares get called away at $20.",thalassamikra,wallstreetbets,508.0

621,2020-12-01,"I'm hoping it doesn't.  You already know these things, but here's where I'm coming from:

BoA holds a lot of their debt (correct me if I'm wrong), and maintains one of the larger short positions.  Makes sense, since they thought GME would likely default.  In light of improvements, BoA's own Nagle gave them a downgrade.  Now in comes Sherman, he's got a good vision, but he's old guard and likely knows his debt holders.  So now he's tasked with turning the company around but not screwing his debt holders as a professional courtesy.

I was perfectly content with thinking that was conjecture, but then I saw this bit from Reuters' on the Hestia/Permit proxy fight.

*Last April, the group signed an agreement with GameStop that prevented it from expressing any concerns about the company and its performance publicly, after some of its demands were met.*

Now, this may be boiler plate and I'm overthinking it, but it seems like the board was suppressing news of any developments.

As for the last piece of the puzzle, if BoA knows GME is on the mend they should have an exit for their shorts.  But I have not seen any indication of an exit.  Can they not exit quietly?

If Cohen comes in, as the outsider he owes nothing to no one and all shorts and debt holders be damned.

This is full Charlie conspiracy here, but it's been the only thing making me second guess my position.  Not enough to exit of course, still buying on red days.",edible_scissors,wallstreetbets,621.0

736,2020-12-01,"No question is too stupid for this thread.  


When you buy an option, you are the one paying for it, so you receive no income off the transaction. You get the benefit of the movement of that option. Ex: If a stock rises and you bought a call, your call will rise in value.  
If a stock drops, the call will drop.  


A put option is the opposite. If you own a put, it rises in value as the stock drops in price, and vice versa.  


If you use my example above, buying GME calls for Dec 31st, if the stock ends up between 16$ and 19.40$, you're buying the shares for 16$, but you already paid 3.40$ for them, so your call is a loss for you, but it's still in the money.  
ex: shares are at 18$ at expiry, the contract will be worth 2$ per share, but you paid 3.40$.  


You can't calculate your gains on an option you bought until you've actually sold it and realize a gain/loss, as it's based on the movement of the stock over time.  


You CAN however calculate your gains on an option you sold however.  
If you sell a call or a put, your maximum profit is the premium you received from selling it.  


If you sold those 16$ call options, you would receive 3.40$ in premiums for the obligation to sell GME shares at 16$ on or before December 31st, as long as your position is open, you are obligated to sell those 100 shares per contract. The maximum profit you make is 3.40$. If shares are below 16$, you keep the premium. If shares are under 19.40$, you're profitable, but only for the diff in between 16 and whatever the final price is.  
If however the stock price goes to 30$, you'd have missed out on the difference in gains between 19.40 and 30$. If you don't own the shares and sold the contract ""naked"", then you'd be obligated to buy shares for 30$ to sell them at 16$ (plus the 3.40 you received at first), netting you a loss of 10.60 per share.  


Selling options is popular in /r/thetagang

Otherwise, you'll lose money almost every time. You also need an exit strategy as soon as you enter in case it's a 1 day pump &amp; dump.

I do like NIO long term, but have a stop loss for 75% of my remaining position (that are essentially ""free"" thanks to my gains) at a 20% retrace.

862,2020-12-01,"Your call option has several things incorporating it for the price.

1) you have the time value. How long is left between the day you buy vs the day it expires.

2) Implied volatility of the stock between the day you buy and the day it expires (how much the expected move in the stock is between now and the expiry date)

3) the difference in price between the option's strike and the stock's price

4) The supply/demand factor.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's use real-life examples:  
You buy 100 shares of GME. You're paying  **16.19** per share as of right now. That means you need to invest 1619$ today to have ownership of these shares.

Your maximum downside is 1619$, your upside is unlimited.

If shares drop back down to 5$, you lose 1,119$ \[ (16.19 - 5) x 100 \]  
If shares run to 30$, you make 1,381$ \[ (30 - 16.19) x 100 \]

December 31 2020 16$ call options currently have a bid of 3.15$ and an ask of 3.40$.  
Which means, if you buy at market price, you're paying 3.40$ per share for the right to buy shares between now and december 31st at 16$.  
Assuming you hold until that day, your break-even price is 19.40$.  
However, you only pay 3.40\*100 = 340$ for this right.

If the stock drops back to 5$, your maximum loss is 340$ in this scenario.  
Your upside however, is unlimited.  
If shares run up to 30$ on december 10th, you still have some time value to the options, plus you have some implied volatility, plus you have the movement.  
So, your 16$ calls will probably sell for slightly more than 14$ (30-16).  
At expiry, you'll have the option to either a) sell those options or b) have them exercise, allowing you to buy the shares for 16$.  


The leverage effect comes in the fact that you only paid 340$ for this contract and in the fact that you get the upside of those 100 shares without as large of a cash outlay.",double_a_mtl,wallstreetbets,862.0

1183,2020-12-01,"I don't care what anybody says, I'm %eleventeen sure I'm not a gay bear. I mean, they're hairy right?

Anyway - I was listening t o one of my wife's boyfriends (got stuck under the bed again) and he said that a lot of what's been posted about the short squeeze on GME was either exaggerated or just wrong. I though a short squeeze happened when I washed my Elons in hot water, so I don't know anything about any of this. But he said something about looking stuff up - like short interest (I've tried wearing my Elons everywhere, no interest at all except from that school resource officer).. I dunno - but this is  the definition of an echo chamber. I come to light a candle, not to curse your darkness.

Don't yolo GME. Really. The short squeeze, in today's market, and  with a high volume stock, is an urban legend. Even 20 years ago, it never happened enough to move a stock more than 10-15%. It's a boomer myth.  GME shorts could cover all outstanding shares in 4 trading days and probably only run the stock up to $19 before they were done.

There are folks here who have been long on GME for 3 years. WSB buying shares ain't doing shit except making us rich when the squeeze happens and providing some hype volume. This has to be treated as a long play.

Same thing happened in October. There was a bunch of hype here around GME, people bought in and the stock went up to like 13ish over a couple days then faded back to 10-11 over the next month. Then the hype built back up here on a big green day last week and everybody started talking about the squeeze again, and now it's going to fade back down to like 15.

1701,2020-12-01,"do you know what makes prices go up? 

buyers. because buyers are demand. when demand exceeds supply, the price goes up. 

do you know what indicates buyer interest? 

volume. because volume tells you how many shares are traded. In order for a share to trade, there has to be a buyer and a seller. If there's low volume, that tells you that not as many buyers are interested.

When buyers aren't interested, the price has to come down to attract buyers. 

There's more supply than demand, so the price goes down. 

Everyday, in the morning, GME spikes. The first house of the day is classically the most volatile time in the market. So more people are interested in buying in the morning, because that's when spikes happen most often. 

The rest of the day, buyers accumulate shares near support instead of chasing pops - which is why GME tends to hold key levels throughout the day. Then, they sell into the morning spike the next day - and smart short sellers take advantage of it. 

Smart shorts aren't sitting around selling GME all day because there's no fucking volume and it's not volatile enough. Pro longs know that without shorts, there's no risk of a short squeeze - which is how you get monster runs.

Go onto your Robinwhore accounts and pre market queue up buy orders for single shares at 17.20,17.21,17.22 and so forth, run this fucker up and manipulate its pre market price to the point where the TA boys and the Algo boys have to jump on because its fucking running and the train might start to generate its own steam.  


Or dont and go back to your job and wendies.

Because you can be fucking sure just snapping up all the shares at the current price will end up with you holding bags and the market price being manipulated down 10% by EOD on like sub 8,000,000 volume.

36,2020-12-03,"Why not enough? You can start with under $2500 with PLTR right now. I decided I'm not buying options anymore thanks to what I have learned on WSB very recently. Just selling them. Most notably, have a list of stocks I would be ok with owning for a while. Wait for a big down day, like Wednesday on PLTR and sell cash secured put. Can net $165 per contract on a 12/9 call with 22 strike. If it doesn't hit you made 165 on 2200 or 7.5%. In 7 trading days. That rocks. Find similar trades for 1-7% a week (assuming you never get assigned)  and you're looking at 2x to 10x your money in a year. That is almost certainly unrealistic in reality, but it certainly has a better chance of making you rich than buying options. It may take a few years instead of some super risky YOLO that could make you rich or wipe out half your net worth in a few weeks. 


If it falls below 22, your cost basis will be 20.35. So you got a 10% discount on today's closing price. That's way better than just buying the shares outright. 

And if you are forced to buy, you immediately start selling covered calls.

Considering the market value with appreciating value it is likely that over time GME will become less and less of a favorite since he owned it in 2015 as well (more of it) and that portfolio was the last public record Scion released as far as I know showing it wasn't even in the top 10 holdings.",Everyman_B,wallstreetbets,58.0

Looking at PLTR which dropped 12% today you could make 6% selling puts expiring on the 9th. And if it did drop enough to make you buy you would be in at a price 10% lower than the current price which is obviously way better than simply buying the shares now.

What you are over looking is they can only short it until a significant catalyst happens than drives regular money to invest in GME.  A good ER, Cohen taking over etc.  When enough money flows in the price will rise faster than they can short it and they will make the wise decision to cover which will add to driving up the price.

Management wants to close stores because they have way to many. They are closing underperforming stores and stores where there are multiple locations in close proximity. This will improve their SG&amp;A and overall bottom line. Its making the company much more cost effective and will retain more of its earnings. It's bullish as hell. Also they are shifting much more towards online, so they don't need the heavy storefront presence they once did.

You clearly haven't seen their updated business model if you still think they are a dinosaur company. Your view of GME is one that no longer exists. They have made a turn and will be successful moving forward. That's why the stock is up 4x from the lows.

3. GME gets a piece of every digital game sold on xbox consoles they sell. 
 
4.  GME is the most convenient way for consumers to turn their current games and consoles into new games/consoles. Yes, they'll get more money from craigslist/ebay/etc, but that's a whole lot more work than just taking your stuff to the store where you're already buying.
 
5. Last console launch pushed the share price to $50. There have been significant buybacks since then.

That was an optimal entry opportunity for those that missed the Microsoft and Senvest pop in October. The price went right back to where it was before.

As expected price started breaking out the Monday after console release which was an obvious positive catalyst that has been on the calendar for months. Breaking $12 out of the prior channel was a safe buy signal, although buying in the consolidation would be smarter but take more balls.

Don't get discouraged if your entry isn't the best. $GME is a volatile long hold and will pay those with the patience and courage to hold through the volatility.

""Shut the fuck up bitch I'm beating my dick"" Snarled JPow as he aggressively cleared his throat. ""Quit your God damn nagging."" He had been furiously touching himself in preparation for European open.

Futures had been period blood red most of the night after the Asian indices opened. Some may call it virus fears, others call it profit taking. Jerome knew better. His Europoor buddies would smell blood in the water and buy the dip.

The PFE vaccine annoucment is released in the UK and JPow let out a gentle moan. He thought to himself ""Oh yes fuck me Dow Jones. Fuck me hard"" as he pulled out some WD-40 to lube up his PPP.

However it seemed that this news was priced in. Futures tanked back down when Germany started their market hours. Things were getting rowdy and JPow's wife walked out demanding an answer. ""What on Earth is going on here Jerome?""

JPow howled like a wildebeest as he busted all over a towel from Citron Research. All out of breath Jerome laid down on his bear skin rug and drank the rest of his whisky. Body still quivering, Jpow whispered ""My work here is done. Green by open. Unlimited QE bitch"" as tech futures turned green.

28,2020-12-04,"Hmm so my understanding is that consoles are sold at cost and the money is made on the subsequent sale of accessories, game, etc. 

The argument to partner with GME is to increase the LTV and TAM.

GME could expand TAM via promotions, selling preowned, payment options, allowing trade-ins. 

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of LTV they've said;

""We have a *higher digital attach rate, customers who buy physical games for us buy more games overall; customers who buy from us, buy more accessories overall. So -- and virtually every category that business, whether it be digital, physical games or accessories,* you see a higher attachment rate at a GameStop store, no question about it. So, that is certainly something that we are proud of and certainly a view that we share. And again as it applies to the *lifetime value,* we have *more of a cross exchange going out with our vendor partners that we probably have in the past.""*

So basically GME gets part of the CAC, gets a share of the LTV and provides to MSFT and Sony increased LTV  and expanded TAM.",reportminority,wallstreetbets,28.0

But here are some thoughts - Based on open interest I would say south of $18 prints for most call writers, so I would expect good news to bounce by 10% or less from here on earnings. Rumors on console sales and the hype around new consoles. Long term I still think this is negative trend. Only way Sony and Microsoft even partner with GME is because the distribution is less expensive for them that way- msft doesn‚Äôt want to deal with physical locations and mall leases- as physical location declines GME becomes less valuable to Sony/msft... actually the bigger the consoles hype the less valuable GME is to the Sony and the gaming ecosystem. if I were management or looking for positive trends I would be looking for anything exclusive that GME can compete on. Exclusive marketing/ sales deals on collectibles or other type things on the periphery of gaming that keeps the buyer connected. In earning report I would continue to talk to as large of population as possible- GME management should be looking for 1 million investors at $2,000 each I doubt they will even talk much to institutional. Robinhood investors are actually GME greatest hope for future in my opinion. Look for lots of hype in earnings over new console, and continued revenue degradation. If GME can hold on long enough, I see boredom from the shorts if the small investor stays engaged. For short squeeze you would need to see significant narrative change beyond anything currently being talked about. Call me when Elon starts offering free rides to Mars for a used PS4. Side note- no one even talking about how CEO was most likely hired to keep stock propped long enough with ‚Äúnew vision‚Äù to work thru the inventory and pay down the debt.

Boomer stuff tends to pop with good vaccine news, tech jumps on bad vaccine news. You get the idea. The tech stuff is decent for covered calls i guess.

If you want to grow and dont want to manage, either go all ETF or throw it in an index fund. 10k+ will get you into VFIAX, which isn't terrible.

I also fail to see how turning into an online retail game store does anything positive to combat sales. Sure, overhead goes down; to what? Match your immense loses of game sales as people buy digitally directly through MSoft and Sony? Not to mention there is still uncertainty with transition of power. What happens if Stimulus gets delayed? Retail markets are going to crash. Even if the delay is only by a couple days or a week. People are going to panic. 

GME mooned. It's near earnings, the market itself doesn't have a stable situation for GME and a correct is going to happen eventually. This is literally what happens in every meme stock this subreddit talks about, except a very select few. 

Don't get me wrong. I cashed out of $GME. I was riding a smaller moon, but still it helped balance my portfolio for losses. But are you honestly telling me there is more positives for $GME than there are negatives?

boomers also thought the console cycle would kill Gamestop because of digital gaming but physical consoles are still the vast majority of sales, never mind the fact that Gamestop is getting a cut of digital sales (even DLC) with Microsoft now

3) they don't lol. If borrow fees goes back to 50% APR for example, short sellers only break even if Gamestop goes to $0 in 2 years.. which is unlikely given their clean balance sheet and the boost a new console cycle will give for a couple years (especially when these consoles actually get games)",ronoron,wallstreetbets,65.0

As of this post, this number has now gone to 30,000 shares available to borrow for shorting and the interest rate is now approaching 17.4%.

Think on that for a moment, it is close to the equivalent of taking multiple credit card debt now for the shorters to continue.

This is just from brokerage data of Interactive Brokers, that being said I imagine the trend is the same amongst the other brokers as well since it is a competitive market and you wouldn't have one broker lending out more and more whilst everyone else isn't.

The shorts have been trying increasingly hard to double down and suppress the price for the past week, the fact that we're at sub 20 is artificial.

I made a 10x on MRNA, took profits and took later strikes. Have a play on JKS earnings Monday and holding ENPH calls.


My losers have been with JKS when the earnings changed from late November. Also PTON calls. I've played SPY calls weeklies and I'm even on that. Not going to get into those again, have me panicked in the middle of the night for futures.

I guess my plays are a bit meme, but got out of NIO before the run up. No position with gme, had a minor thing with pltr and then got out once I made a quick buck. I played SPCE once in a while but not for this bump. I got to 100k once before on the back of my JKS exposure in Oct, then it crashed. I learned from  that if a position runs up sell it take profits, roll to further OTM with different expires  you get the most pop on OTM when it first starts to move.

The 30% means a lot because the consoles are guaranteed to sell out for the foreseeable future, meaning the larger share of consoles they get the larger number of customers they will get. No one will buy new consoles without picking up ancillary items to go with them, those ancillary items are what provide profits. Additionally, you are more likely to return to the company you bought things from for related items. So if GME sells someone a console, they are likely to get other gaming items from GME in the future since they sign people up for the rewards program.

GME on the other hand is a binary bet (more or less). The company goes bankrupt and shorts win, the company is not bankrupt, and shares double.

I expect a dip by paper hands bitches in response to earnings. Shares price should dip and we should buy in then in anticipation of the future. Changes will be coming and we can ride the hype later, but early on expect a tangible response to shit earnings instead of GME future plans hype.

206,2020-12-05,"I just have a hard time believing there are 63K people who actually think GME is going to have a VW type of short squeeze.  VW was 95% owned by 2 holders who wouldn't sell under any condition so it was extremely difficult for shorts to cover.

If a stock is held by tons of smaller owners, many will sell on the way up so even if there is a squeeze, it will just be up like 10-20% then back down because nobody is doing this because they believe in the company long term.  People are wasting time/money on this ""maybe"" 10-20% when recovery stocks are going up like crazy (opportunity cost of letting your money sit idle in GME) right now.

If you want to bet on epic GME short squeeze, just wait till it happens (which I seriously doubt it will but assuming by some miracle it happens) then buy puts at the high.  You make money riding it down instead of up and you won't risk leaving your money somewhere indefinitely with a high chance of nothing happening.",hw71179,wallstreetbets,206.0

211,2020-12-05,"Yeah, good to be thinking about that play. To be totally honest, I am not sure if this SPAC structure impacts calls. I just know that for previous SPACs the call just converted. I had NKLA calls back in June that I got 100% return on investment, no issue when the ticker changed to NKLA, sold them that day actually. So I guess I am assuming the calls are the same and the warrants on them means nothing when it comes to buying and selling the options themselves. 

As for specific positions. I have a few options but the vast majority of my position is in commons. I'm talking 90-95%. The calls I do have are for March, which might be down a little bit and then I have a minority of Dec 20 calls. Those are getting nailed but they are more OTM like $40 and just a small little position in cases something really is announced this week.

Long and short of it is that I really like the commons. I have justified in my head now that even if I have to wait 12 mo to see a gain I am pleased with, the outcome justifies that wait and any opportunity cost I am paying in the meantime with that capital. If I just took that money and day traded or whatever on GME, I may make some good returns in the short term, but the relative risk there is more and so I will also get burned a lot in 12 mo period. Whereas here, parking half the portfolio there to just sit is a great ""play"". The chance I don't have a 150%-200% ROI in 12 mo is very low imo.",deltalake,wallstreetbets,211.0

249,2020-12-05,"The year is 2030, spx is at 20,000. Long calls have proven the most successful trade for the last decade, wsb becomes the largest investment group in the world as their gains have outpaced hedge funds and others who manage risk by 100-1. In the year 2025 wsb pulled their power together and nominated those with the most gains to become the defacto faces of the sub, our combined ownership of the stock market made us majority shareholders of most companies with our delegates now holding board positions. 

Earnings calls are now held through AMA's on wsb, companies figured they'd atleast try to get their majority investors to learn about what they do as a company this way. ""xXTendyMaster69420Xx"" poses the question on AAPLs Q4 2030 results AMA  ""if Tim cook gay? That mean he bear? Bear go down, buy put??"". As the largest shareholder of apple with over 100million% gains in calls since 2020, whatever xXTendyMaster69420Xx decides to do, controls the future of the company. Goldman and jpm try to control the situation, trying to convince him bulls are the gay ones, but it doesn't work, he just keeps replying ""bear r gay! bear r fuk!"". Finally he edits his initial comment ""dog shitted on right side of lawn, apple go down"" and just like that apple falls 80% as wsb sells all their apple holdings.

 Luckily, apple was only the tenth largest company in the market behind the likes of SPCE, TSLA, DKNG, GME, and other stonks (official renaming of stocks to stonks happened in 2028 after ""ThetaGAYng"" was elected president, shortly after he declared Citron a terrorist organization). The market fell, but the dip was bought like usual. for the next six years ThetaGAYng created the greatest bull run in American history through policies leading economic experts have called ""truly fucking retarded"" and ""the worst ideas I've ever heard"".

312,2020-12-05,"Each currency has a pair. For example, the US Dollar can pair with the Euro to make a EURUSD. This is called a currency pair. Basically, it‚Äôs how much one currency costs using another currency. So if the EURUSD is trading at say $1.2505, then you can buy 1 Euro for the cost of $1.2505 Us Dollars. The goal is to either buy the Euro with hopes that the price will increase so you can sell at a profit, or sell the Euro with hopes that the price will decrease so you can buy it back at a lower price for a profit. Much like Calls and Puts. 

Forex is risky because of the leverage and volatility. People often blow their accounts because they use too much leverage, improper lot sizes (how many units of currency), underestimate the volatility, and don‚Äôt use proper risk/reward ratios. a 50pip SL should have a 150pip TP. 

It takes a long time to understand the markets fully and each currency pair trades different, much like how TSLA trades differently than GME or SPY.

I made a post about this, but I bought 30 otm options on gme and estimate that forced MMs to buy ~$5000 of shares and it only cost me -$1600. If we all do this, stocks go up!",NeverOddOreveN69,wallstreetbets,395.0

157,2020-12-07,"Your risk proposition hasn't changed, it actually is technically higher given you assume liquidity risk by holding the asset overnight. There just existed a small arbitrage opportunity that could be capitalized on for a period of time. 

You need scale to make this both worth your time and your dime. Assuming the net change between close and open (doesn't include down days or other freak swings) is 0.001% (a tenth of 1%) per day. After a year or about 250 (simple math) trading days, equates to a 25% return on the market from JUST that trade. Awesome, winner winner chicken dinner. But you CANNOT miss a single day, cannot ""instinct"" extra gains, just simple, open-close every day. 

But say you have trading fees, let's assume $3.00 per full circle trade. You need to make above $750 per year to cover just the fees. To get to $751 to even show a $1 profit. That is currently ~9 shares of the SPY at its last close ($369.85) or $3329 invested to net $1 above fees to your pocket. Congratulations, you made $1 on $3329 not to mention the time value of your time to open and close the trades (WHICH IS VALUABLE). Plus, gotta pay uncle sam, so there's that headache. 

Now, at scale, when you're talking $1BN moving around, that's when this trade makes sense. The fund nets $1M per day on it. At that level, go for it, get those free micropennies, but for us down here scouring WSB, our time and money is better used yeeting 0DTE PLTR calls and pumping fuel into the GME moon machine.",thadcastle1991,wallstreetbets,157.0

Say it hits $100 and all you guys try to sell your shares who is going to buy them? This will lead to paper hands retail slowly lowering the price down trying to get out of their long before it drops back to a fair number. All the shorts have to do is wait for that. If no one will buy at 100 then people will sell for say 95 then no one buys and they drop to 90 and so on and so on.

B&amp;M 4.5bn rev at 0.45x will equal another 2bn in valuation, plus 800m in cash, plus inventory = 3bn+

There is your 6bn+ market cap. Or $100/share. This is not giving GME any sort of special treatment or high multiples. It's just fair market valuations given their revenue numbers.

Unprofitability, shorting, negative sentiment, and covid had driven this stock into the ground. Now it seems as if all of these things have changed or are changing for the better. Total company turn around is delivering good results so far.

I think they payed it early, because they made bank this quarter and wanted to send a silent message. If you payed attention they haven't broken the silent period, but they have addressed a few of rc's points in their letter, or as much as they could w/o breaking silent period. Personally i feel like this earnings will be one for the ages. Pivotal imo. Gamestonk has payed a ton of debt early (already said that), but why, because they made Bank have plenty of cash on hand and will have a banger of an earnings. Imo this q will be positive by atleast +.03 eps or higher. I know a few people who dropped a few hundred on used games just to get the time to go by. Plus the market is forward looking.

If it was to happen, would it be a sharp spike over a few hours or a gradual increase over days?

Would the squeeze happen pre or post- Q4 earnings next year (if holding shares, would it be better to sell pre-Q4 earnings or after)

And this is all speculative, but based on your research, what price do you see GME hitting during the squeeze? I've seen some crazy numbers like $100/share being thrown around but that still seems mental to me.",RommSearcher,wallstreetbets,431.0

Look for volatile stocks that I actually want to own. Hold shares and sell covered calls or hold cash and sell cash secured puts.

First time poster, well-known GME owner. 

Very excited to see you all joining the rag-tag GME OGs that have been to sub $3 and back. Something does feel different this time. 

I won‚Äôt rehash the story, just here with a friendly reminder about share lending:

1.	‚Å†GTC limit orders don‚Äôt do shit to inhibit lendability. GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEADS.
2.	‚Å†Shares held in cash accounts can only be lent with your explicit permission (e.g. enrollment into a lending program like @ IBKR, Schwab, etc.). When this starts going berserk they will reach out and offer you low at first, eventually ridiculous annualized interest rates to opt in. Look at the historical interest rates on iborrow during the proxy recall this Spring as a proof point.
3.	‚Å†Shares held in a margin account can and will be lent, unless you are NOT using any margin and the position is fully cash secured. If any portion of the position is no longer secured, the broker will assuredly be lending your GME. Those prime broker fuckers are frothing at the mouth to lend all shares (even synthetic ones) that exist (and then some, thanks to synthetic longs‚Äîsee S3 Partners‚Äô Ihor Dusaniwsky‚Äôs excellent writeup here that specifically discusses GME: https://www.shortsight.com/short-interest-of-float-2-0/ ). They‚Äôve been doing it for years (see my Twitter (RodAlzmann) for some charting on the shares short vs. price vs. short interest on max and other charts) and will gladly keep making $$$ off your shares.

Some other kids asks if they can borrow the candy and will return at 20% interest. The teacher is like shit! Ok, free candy! 

Those kids give the candy away to the girls they like in class. Those girls give them back to the teacher to hold. Now the teacher is holding 20 pieces of candy (10 out on loan but hey, those boys are good for it or she‚Äôll call their parents!). 

Some boys continue to borrow more candy and pass them out. This time the interest is 30%. Borrowed 3 more pieces. 

Now the teacher is holding 23 pieces of candy for the class, 13 on loan. Plus 3 pieces owed worth of interest. 

Well. Friday comes along and it‚Äôs time to pay up. But there‚Äôs none on the market! Or very few if anyone else brought some in.

1041,2020-12-07,"Maybe don't start now, but learn how they work because this is WSB and you'll soon get banned for talking about shares and making money.

&amp;#x200B;

In short, you write a call contract (obligates you to sell your shares at a specific strike price) and sell it on the market for a premium, and you hold the shares at least until the contract expires. The contract has a expiry date and strike price, and costs a premium (that you get paid if you're selling). Each contract = 100 shares, so you could sell 2 contracts.  


Go look in the ""trade options"" section of GME, at the top select ""sell"" and ""call"" and swipe left and right for different dates, and up and down for different premiums. It'll say something like GME $20c 12/18/2020 $0.32 which means you get paid 0.32 x 100 shares = $32 for one contract right now, and if the share price goes above $20 by 12/18/2020 then whoever bought your contract can then buy your shares. You get paid the premium, and your profit is the strike price minus whatever you paid for your shares. If it doesn't reach $20 then they won't buy your shares and you keep the premium and shares to do with as you please. You want to sell one with a high premium so you make decent profit, at a close date and a high strike price so that it expires quickly WITHOUT reaching the strike price, and you get paid premium and keep the shares when it expires.  


Risks include GME going to $50 and you only making the strike of $20 minus your cost plus premium, or GME going to $0 and you can't sell them and lose all your money.",DidYouReadThatThing,wallstreetbets,1041.0

I can't say what will happen to GME in the next week, but it does seem‚Äîaccording to the DD we've all read‚Äîthat there is a future where it trades above $20 somewhere in 2021, even without a short squeeze. Right now could be a time where you eat the opportunity cost and just hold for 90 days and see what happens and reassess after that period. It will suck, but in Feb/March we may have a shot at profit. My plan is to hold, and even buy more‚Äîthough I admit my bags are far lighter than yours. Give it until January 2021.

167,2020-12-09,"I‚Äôll answer since you‚Äôre genuine. An aspect to the price you paid for the option (premium) is the implied volatility as it affects the price. Essentially a stock that moves a shit ton up/down is more likely than a stable stock to move up/down; sooo either direction‚Äôs options (calls or puts) that are further away from the current price of the stock are statistically more likely, thus being more valuable. Might sound circular, but the potential (implied) volatility makes further Out-of-the-money strikes more likely.

If the stock calms down (aka consolidates) then the big moves become less likely. Because of this, implied volatility goes down, because the stock‚Äôs chance of making these huge moves is less realistic.

The other aspect is time. As expiration gets closer, the likelihood of a stock moving to a certain range narrows. Moving 50% up/down in a year is more likely than moving 50% up/down in a week, which makes the option worth less. This decay in the value is measured by theta, which is commonly referenced in theta decay. Really, chances potential stock price ranges narrow as time draws closer, making derivatives worth less.

In all seriousness, it takes dedicated time to fundamentally understand options. I‚Äôm talking manually calculating Black-Scholes models yourself to see how the pieces fit, at least until you understand how the pricing ‚Äúparts‚Äù fit.

Your options are probably draining value simply because theta (time decay) becomes an exponential drain on the value, as the probability of GME being in-the-money for your option becomes exponentially less likely at the date of expiration.",Nosefuroughtto,wallstreetbets,167.0

182,2020-12-09,"There are a surprising number of short sighted people on reddit.  Gme is an under valued company.  They are not going bankrupt.  They are not going out of business.

They were only 2% away from being profitable this quarter while covid hurt their business.  They have a high density of stores that cost money to lease. They are shutting 1000 stores. So instead of 20 in a city they will have 5 to 10 best performing stores.  If nothing else changes they will be profitable from the reduction in lease expense alone. The stock is back to where it was 8 trading days ago the day before Thanksgiving.

Other things are changing. If you plan on being successful in investing you need to do a little more research and understand why people that have earned a million dollars are investing in GME.  Not everyone wants to throw their money in a meme stock and hope they don't get burned. 

 I actually view this as a pretty low risk play.  I have $70k in it.  I was up $27k at close today.  My guess is I will be even again tomorrow.  I did sell all my Dec calls today before close so have already booked profit.

I have money in AMD, Fsly $100k in (which shot up today), PLTR $89k in (which shot up yesterday), Adbe, Nvda, Logi, Splk etc.  You can make money in almost any stock with patience and understanding trends. I am up 90% since June 1st.  Max reward with minimum risk.

Only one that is close is maybe Amzn and they really have a completely different part of their business that is actually a tech play. The also sell their own ""store brands"".

Gme is a value play on a company that is undervalued because almost everyone is underestimating their value.  Kind of like how Nordstrom went up on Earnings that were less bad than the street was expecting.

* A cycle that promotes digital so heavy that consoles were sold without disks. Something that impacts physical stores. (Yes yes, 30% of Xbox sales. A console with zero exclusives that will be available on PC. And missing out on any of those increases from Sony, the console with the most exclusives and estimated to be the larger platform this cycle)

266,2020-12-09,"Generally assignment risk is only realized on deep ITM options or - of course - at expiration for ITM or near-ITM options. Early exercise of near ITM options makes little sense because an option owner will be sacrificing all extrinsic value paid (premium) to make the exercise. 

If it dips in and out of the money it really makes no difference in terms of exercise to the option holder; the option will exercise at a set strike price regardless of current market rate. If anything it may behoove an option owner to trade shares in pre-trading or after-hours to lock in a more favorable price, followed by an exercise pending the above regarding give-up of premium. An an example: buy 100 GME at $13.50 premarket and exercise the $14 put to sell. 

For note, here is what Robinhood says regarding exercise requests, ""If you exercise your option between 12:00 AM ‚Äì 4:00 PM ET, your exercise will be submitted immediately and you won‚Äôt be able to cancel. If you exercise your option after 4:00 PM ET, it will be queued for the next trading day, and you‚Äôll have until 11:59 PM ET to cancel the order.""

Basically, if Cohen tries to take over, GME can 5x its current share count asap, making it mathematically improbably for Cohen to buy the company outright with his own substantial warchest alone. 

If they 5x their current shares, the BOD would lose a shitton of money. It looks like a nuke to me, where BOD dares Cohen to take over, and if he tries, everyone gets nuked. 

Cohen forcefully taking over seems unlikely to me. If he decides to back down and be content with his 10% stake, take on an advisory role (he burned the board seat offer with his public letter), he still stands to make a ton of money, and we shareholders do too, just not as much as if Cohen was able to take over.

Appreciate the counter. However, cost of sales/gross profit goes down when your fixed costs (i.e. labor and lease costs, debt costs) stay fixed when revenue goes down. That's what's happening with GME. They have fixed costs tied to running physical stores that are not bringing in the revenues they should because of covid &amp; end of console cycle. 

Look forward and think about what cost of sales / profitability will look like when it's *not* the end of one console cycle but a beginning of a new one, going into a holiday season where everyone is locked up at home playing games,  major games like cyberpunk got pushed to Q4, and people need somewhere to trade in their PS4/Xbox Ones because hey the new consoles are backwards compatible.

Now and if we talk about RC that will be my main point: you must have noticed that on his letter dated 16 November 2020 he declared owning 9.98% of GME. This number is extremely significant. When somebody crosses the 10% threshold of ownership of a public company he must declare it to the SEC within 10 days.

RC has publicly declared 9.98% ownership because it is a very convenient position for his next move. Whichever next move he wants it to be. And this is the moment when a M&amp;A lawyer is entering the chat. Theoretically speaking from 9.98% you can make deals left and right with big funds who own chunks of the stock + being long calls and exercise. If I am not mistaking RC has entered the stock when it was $4 to $5 range so 10 to 15 calls January were cheap AF.

**What we learned at earnings:** 

1. They beat estimates on EPS. 
2. Revenue down YoY in Q3 (expected) but up in Nov YoY (expected)
3. Cash increased to $600MM which is greater than their short-term and long-term debt. 
4. They *may* offer more shares. Giving themselves the option to (i.e. take advantage of the squeeze if the thing skyrockets and they want to use the cash). They have a few years of optionality here. 
5. Management is retarded and particularly bad at telling the story of their business as well as Q&amp;A. 

**What hasn't changed**

1. You as a shareholder are not paying interest to hold your position. Shorts are. As a result, shorts eventually have to cover, otherwise they will lose. This is a long game. 
2. They are not a bankruptcy risk. That part of the short thesis is dead.
3. Ryan Cohen (10% stakeholder) wrote a letter earlier to make public he didn't like how mgmt was handling GME. The earnings call did current mgmt no favors. 

At $14/share, that puts GME at \~$900MM market cap - for a company that has **$1BN in revenue in a quarter** at the point where a) covid is dampening retail and b) the absolute end of the console cycle. This is the lowest point of the cycle for a cyclical business. Subtract the net cash position of $200MM and that puts you at $700BN valuation for the 

So, abandon ship if you want - but I think a $4BN+/year business model with no net debt, entering into the beginning of a new console generation, with hawks like RC frothing for a takeover still make this a really interesting opportunity.",FatAspirations,wallstreetbets,449.0

452,2020-12-09,"Ok. I don‚Äôt think it has been noted here before.

GME has a 60% Cash to Market Cap [ratio](https://ycharts.com/glossary/terms/cash_to_mktcap). Meaning they are long $600 millions of cash while their market cap is $1bn. That‚Äôs a very impressive level of safety. 10% is regarded as a strong cash position.

That said, it brings me to discuss two important points:

1. Is this company in a potential position of bankruptcy? Absolutely not. Strong cash, revenue on the rise, profitability to be achieved within weeks.

2. Do they need to grab more cash from selling shares? I do not believe it is necessary. So why are they doing it? It is either a weak move from their CFO, but really from a financial point of view it does not make sense. Or they have an hidden agenda. Which potentially could be that they anticipate their share price to rise significantly in the foreseeable future so they could be able to sell shares at a high price and I quote ‚Äúat-the-market program, if we chose to use it, provide us further options to enhance our liquidity alternatives to support an efficient and successful execution of our transformational strategies.‚Äù

574,2020-12-09,"The Case For Bankruptcy

The scenario in which a short squeeze doesn't occur is PROBABLY the scenario in which GME ultimately faces bankruptcy.

As the thesis for short squeeze is laid out, the thesis for the short sellers is also crystal clear.

After all, GME is STILL a large brick and mortar store that is trying to sell a product that could be very easily purchased using the power of the internet.

The revenue of GameStop for the past few quarters is in¬†steep decline.¬†The company is overly leveraged and has many stores that are loss-making operations.

Its online store has much lower visibility and investment and is lacking in many aspects(in my personal view).

Its credit rating is not that good and Cohen himself somewhat criticised the management for trying to hang on to its old ways of doing things.

Gaming and associated products are bound to¬†thrive and grow at a CAGR of 9% and had grown even more in the past.

Yet GameStop FAILS to capitalize on this trend and is continuously losing market share while destroying its¬†financials.¬†This is a clear sign that something is inherently broken within the company.

While the management does seem to be trying to fix things, it could prove to be too little too late.

To change its fortune it needs to turn around its business models like Best Buy or Walmart. Yet it seems pretty unfeasible judging by its financials.

GameStop had adequate time to change with the times and become an early adopter but its backwards-looking culture and late entry made its journey full of competition.

Short sellers believe that ultimately GameStop wouldn't be able to achieve a business turnaround and gain a critical mass of customers in its online space and management incompetency will ultimately lead to its bankruptcy. Thus its faith would be like the numerous mom and pop shops or the various retail giants that were.

Even if GME share rises due to retail mania and market maker hedging; institutional investor ownership could¬†decline, leaving retail investors as the ultimate bagholders. The shorts may bite their tongue and keep on paying interest as long as they believe no fundamental change in the business is going to happen.

Which means they may not need to cover their position as long as the company becomes bankrupt, thus the fabled short squeeze may never materialize.

After all, most shorts are probably institutional investors like Melvin Capital who can always maintain their margin requirements(if any) and like the retail investors they can also figure out what the retail investors are trying to do and thus avoid triggering any short squeeze.

What a lot of people are speculating is Ryan Cohen taking over and then the Q4 earnings in March which will have the console sales on there and should handily beat analyst estimates.

I'm still debating with myself whether to farm boring 5% daily BA gains, or go all in on GME again though. Sherman said during the earnings call (I was listening live) that they will reveal holiday sales data in January 2021, so that kind of indicates they will try and maintain the stock price from now until the Q4 earnings report, but that's still an awful lot of time to sit on a stock that, as far as I can tell, could go completely sideways after the post-seloff recovery.",RandomYouTuber69,wallstreetbets,599.0

Also, until last year they had a dividend.  Both prove you wrong. Not to mention they have 600 million in cash and and only about 250 million in debt. So they are cash heavy. Not to mention Q4 this year they said they should be profitable. And back to my post, IF they sell additional shares into the short squeeze, then they will have a surplus of cash from that and they will then be able to resume their share buy backs canceling the dilution of the shares they sell in the squeeze but they will buy them back at a much lower price.

CEO/boards *absolutely* take activists seriously, but you have to have *earn* it and that takes years and a couple of big wins (see Icahn, Greenlight, Starboard, 3rd Pt, etc) before you have the cred to be taken seriously. 

Starboard v Darden like 7yrs ago was a good example. Prior to that campaign, nobody outside the industry had heard of starboard but they were very successful with targeted transactional campaigns. When they approached Darden, they got rebuffed. Starboard then launched a very noisy, long and dedicated public campaign that took like 12-18mo from beginning to end (the public part was a little shorter). Eventually Starboard ‚Äòwon‚Äô and Darden semi-capitulated. But the big thing was that starboard was a ‚Äòname‚Äô and the next campaign they went on management listened. 

This thing with GME was a fucking clown show. Some first-time kid whose resume is that they hit the lottery w a .com wants a seat at the big boy table?? They have never run a campaign before and a strongly worded letter will get you there? And they are going to use that seat to tell the business to ditch its business model on the fly to create a 2-way/3-way (it want clear) marketplace for game downloads.....funded by selling shit that has a net zero liquidation value? Motherfucking LOLOLOLOL - I can hear the board laughing at that. That type of transformation would take 3-5 years and a few hundred million dollars. OPs thesis was that it happens....today.

1064,2020-12-08,"People playing the GME gambit should have stocks not options. Anyone with calls specifically playing this earnings call was very special indeed. 

Gamestops really interesting because as a business it's been slowly failing for years and it's stock price reflected a very bearish outlook but fundamentally the business has the cash money to survive for ages and there's a concerted effort to turn it around (rather than just sleepwalk it into the ground). If the stock price holds over 12 through this sell off there's a very really possibility that the stock will rebound to 15+ (just look at the peaks and troughs recently) in the coming weeks and then Q4 earnings could see them posting actually positive EPS and if GME is still a 'meme stonk' at that point it could pop off bigly off the back of that. I don't envisage a crazy short squeeze taking it to 5 batrillion $$$ but there's absolutely no reason that this stock can't go to 30+ just based on its revenue streams - if they can convince the market and consumers that they have a future in the digital space as well as a viable merch/niche brick and mortar operation.",Lazybopazy,wallstreetbets,1064.0

Yeah it tanked AH but the earnings report and call are mostly great.  I am long on GME (1.5k shares plus a few 2021 calls) but I bought 12/11/20 puts because I expected it to drop.  Nobody thought 3Q earnings were going to be positive (or up from last year when COD was released in 3Q as opposed to this year when it came out in 4Q) but they beat the earnings estimates, significantly reduced costs, and are clearly listening to Cohen and pushing hard away from brick and mortar to having a bigger online presence.

The shelf offering is not great for people hoping for the short squeeze, assuming they take advantage of it, but $100m is not a huge amount of share dilution. Even if they used all of it, the short interest would still be at unprecedented levels.

1. Ryan Cohen does a hostile takeover and dumps CEO Sherman and the rest of the boomer board, all shares will be recalled, forcing all shorts to HAVE to buy shares and give them back to the lenders, triggering the MOASS.  

2. CEO Sherman holds the best earnings call of his life, providing positive guidance and future outlook, potentially convincing enough to trigger a mass buy of shares, triggering the rally up to $18 and maybe even the MOASS.

3026,2020-12-08," I posted this over at stocktwits but this thread is relevant for this post too. 

To start, I have 20,000 shares and 570 April 20/25Cs across three separate accounts. I also picked up about 100 calls for Jan/late Dec this week just for the hell of it (fuck IV crush when you‚Äôre boarding a rocket).  I'm holding the all through ER. This could prove to be folly or it could make me very rich. I‚Äôll know pretty soon.  

I know there has been some discussion of this here and there, but I find the psychological profiles of the folks in this situation to be very interesting--particularly because both Sherman (current CEO) and Cohen know that, fundamentals aside, this thing is sitting on a powder keg with the short %. But first take Cohen. Boy genius who builds Chewy with his smarts and an ethos dedicated to care for the customer. Beats Amazon in this niche area because he outworked and outsmarted everyone. Worked super close with his Dad, who sounds like an amazing businessman with an old school ethic about treating customers/employees well. After building this juggernaut he sold it for 3Bil. Dude did all of this before he was 33. Then says screw diversification and YOLOs into Apple and Wells Fargo. Apple goes berzerk and splits and he makes more millions. All the while watching and waiting for something new to come around.

And then almost exactly a year ago, Cohen‚Äôs Dad dies. There are many interviews when he talks about this: his Dad was only 69 and he is barely 35 and that‚Äôs early as shit to lose your father and best friend. Do not underestimate what that can do to someone and what lessons one might take from that or how that person feels now barely a year away from that happening. Cohen clearly reveres his Dad for his hard working ethic and how he taught him tenacity when you know you‚Äôre right. So Cohen finds GME and he sees that this brilliantly set-up company in an explosive growth sector has been run into the ground by prior management. He thinks he knows the way out: the ‚ÄúChewy-fication‚Äù of GameStop ‚Äì efficient, customer-focused ecommerce sector domination. So he takes a big stake and then talks to Sherman and explains what needs to happen to save this company.

And if the letter he sent last month reflects reality and is not posturing, Cohen is rebuffed a bit. Maybe Boomer Sherman doesn‚Äôt like the cut of his jib and patronizes him. Maybe Cohen didn‚Äôt like Sherman‚Äôs focus on short term profit at the expense of building long-term customer loyalty (the one of two trucks his Dad talks about, which Cohen cites frequently in his interviews). Who knows. But whatever it was, being rebuffed seems to piss Cohen off--judging by the tone of that letter. Oh, and he‚Äôs made it known that he has hired basically the top activist investor/takeover law firm and attorney in the country. So he puts Sherman in the hot seat: outline your plan to make GameStop what I know it can be as soon as possible. He knows Q3 earnings is in three weeks when he sends that letter. He‚Äôs saying: Don‚Äôt you let another conference call go by without outlining this plan. Or else.

And the ‚Äúor else‚Äù is of course all speculative. But I do not think that the ‚Äúor else‚Äù is Cohen selling his shares and sulking home pissed off that these mean Boomers didn‚Äôt do things the way he wanted them to do. No, I think this guy drinks Sherman‚Äôs fucking milkshake, takes this thing and shows the world how it‚Äôs done. He‚Äôs got the eye of the tiger, he‚Äôs still in that young and crushing it phase. He‚Äôs got his Dad, his Obi-Wan, guiding him on this. So he‚Äôs going to do this right. This is his moment and I think he sees that. He‚Äôs watching his baby Chewy with a MC of $30M. He knows he can do that or better with GME. And he is not going to take no for an answer.

Then take Sherman. Dude has been Mr. Big Shot Hired-Gun CEO for a while now. Brought in to right this ship and Be The Man. And just as he starts to turn around this company‚Äîthe moment he has been waiting for these difficult past 1.5 years (THE NEW CONSOLES ARE HERE!). And he knows that he‚Äôs going to be able to show shareholders that he can turn this thing around. But then this Chewy billionaire startup bro who is probably the same age as his children comes in and starts trying to tell \*him\* how to run a major public corporation. The nerve of this kid. Then, to make things worse, as Sherman prepares for the console release season and the Q3 earnings call, Cohen writes a scathing public letter attached to his 13D that calls out GameStop for being run by idiots and calls out Sherman specifically for being an out-of-touch boomer who doesn‚Äôt know the value of what he even has or what to do with it.

This is going to be fun to watch, to say the least.",CPTHubbard,wallstreetbets,3026.0
3027,2020-12-08," I posted this over at stocktwits but this thread is relevant for this post too. 

To start, I have 20,000 shares and 570 April 20/25Cs across three separate accounts. I also picked up about 100 calls for Jan/late Dec this week just for the hell of it (fuck IV crush when you‚Äôre boarding a rocket).  I'm holding the all through ER. This could prove to be folly or it could make me very rich. I‚Äôll know pretty soon.  

I know there has been some discussion of this here and there, but I find the psychological profiles of the folks in this situation to be very interesting--particularly because both Sherman (current CEO) and Cohen know that, fundamentals aside, this thing is sitting on a powder keg with the short %. But first take Cohen. Boy genius who builds Chewy with his smarts and an ethos dedicated to care for the customer. Beats Amazon in this niche area because he outworked and outsmarted everyone. Worked super close with his Dad, who sounds like an amazing businessman with an old school ethic about treating customers/employees well. After building this juggernaut he sold it for 3Bil. Dude did all of this before he was 33. Then says screw diversification and YOLOs into Apple and Wells Fargo. Apple goes berzerk and splits and he makes more millions. All the while watching and waiting for something new to come around.

And then almost exactly a year ago, Cohen‚Äôs Dad dies. There are many interviews when he talks about this: his Dad was only 69 and he is barely 35 and that‚Äôs early as shit to lose your father and best friend. Do not underestimate what that can do to someone and what lessons one might take from that or how that person feels now barely a year away from that happening. Cohen clearly reveres his Dad for his hard working ethic and how he taught him tenacity when you know you‚Äôre right. So Cohen finds GME and he sees that this brilliantly set-up company in an explosive growth sector has been run into the ground by prior management. He thinks he knows the way out: the ‚ÄúChewy-fication‚Äù of GameStop ‚Äì efficient, customer-focused ecommerce sector domination. So he takes a big stake and then talks to Sherman and explains what needs to happen to save this company.

And if the letter he sent last month reflects reality and is not posturing, Cohen is rebuffed a bit. Maybe Boomer Sherman doesn‚Äôt like the cut of his jib and patronizes him. Maybe Cohen didn‚Äôt like Sherman‚Äôs focus on short term profit at the expense of building long-term customer loyalty (the one of two trucks his Dad talks about, which Cohen cites frequently in his interviews). Who knows. But whatever it was, being rebuffed seems to piss Cohen off--judging by the tone of that letter. Oh, and he‚Äôs made it known that he has hired basically the top activist investor/takeover law firm and attorney in the country. So he puts Sherman in the hot seat: outline your plan to make GameStop what I know it can be as soon as possible. He knows Q3 earnings is in three weeks when he sends that letter. He‚Äôs saying: Don‚Äôt you let another conference call go by without outlining this plan. Or else.

And the ‚Äúor else‚Äù is of course all speculative. But I do not think that the ‚Äúor else‚Äù is Cohen selling his shares and sulking home pissed off that these mean Boomers didn‚Äôt do things the way he wanted them to do. No, I think this guy drinks Sherman‚Äôs fucking milkshake, takes this thing and shows the world how it‚Äôs done. He‚Äôs got the eye of the tiger, he‚Äôs still in that young and crushing it phase. He‚Äôs got his Dad, his Obi-Wan, guiding him on this. So he‚Äôs going to do this right. This is his moment and I think he sees that. He‚Äôs watching his baby Chewy with a MC of $30M. He knows he can do that or better with GME. And he is not going to take no for an answer.

Then take Sherman. Dude has been Mr. Big Shot Hired-Gun CEO for a while now. Brought in to right this ship and Be The Man. And just as he starts to turn around this company‚Äîthe moment he has been waiting for these difficult past 1.5 years (THE NEW CONSOLES ARE HERE!). And he knows that he‚Äôs going to be able to show shareholders that he can turn this thing around. But then this Chewy billionaire startup bro who is probably the same age as his children comes in and starts trying to tell \*him\* how to run a major public corporation. The nerve of this kid. Then, to make things worse, as Sherman prepares for the console release season and the Q3 earnings call, Cohen writes a scathing public letter attached to his 13D that calls out GameStop for being run by idiots and calls out Sherman specifically for being an out-of-touch boomer who doesn‚Äôt know the value of what he even has or what to do with it.

And this kid demands another strategic review and a public response on the obvious direction that Sherman needs to take the company. Sherman is not dumb. He knows who Cohen‚Äôs attorney is and he knows what Cohen is implying in that letter and the money Cohen has. Sherman now knows that the time he has to show shareholders he can turn this thing around has now shrunk. It‚Äôs go time. New consoles are out, Q4 numbers are likely to be through the roof and you have to address shareholders for the Q3 earnings call ‚Äì one that everyone knows is likely to be a dud since it was pre-console cycle.

3120,2020-12-08,"For what it‚Äôs worth I expect a bleed today and a drop tonight. Not much of a drop but will likely drop some. Then a continual bleed up into next earnings. Next 4 qtrs are going to be great, historically speaking new releases have always been good for GME. 

I don‚Äôt expect a violent fall with earning. Earnings are going to suck, everyone knows that. Guidance will be key tonight. 

After tonight I expect the bleed up as shorts try to exit their positions (stage one of a short squeeze), they have 3 months to get it done. Those left holding the bag will get pinched for the infinite squeeze at earnings.

I don't see GME's big pop coming up until around Q2 2021

Q3 2020 report I think won't include new console sales. New console sales have been limited anyway due to short supply.

AMD's chips were in low supply due to silica mining getting hit by COVID, but AMD is expecting the 7nm wafers to become more available around end Q1 2021

2/21/2020 ""AMD has confirmed ‚Äúthat wafer supply is tight‚Äù on TSMC‚Äôs advanced 7nm process.""
https://www.pcgamesn.com/amd/7nm-wafer-supply-2020

""second half of 2020, AMD will double their 7nm orders making them TSMC‚Äôs largest customer of 7nm""

Secondly, everyone knows Funko Pops position in GME one person called GME a 'glorified junko brick and mortar'... Well... 

""Funko Inc (NASDAQ: FNKO) ranks among the worst-performing stocks under Piper Sandler's coverage, but the research firm is now confident in a rebound after chatting with management.

Thirdly, the Microsoft digital revenue won't start flowing in until the new consoles are more widely available and in people's hands

Fourthly, they paid off massive amounts of debt and their EPS growth was showing positive upward trend from Q1-2020 to Q2-2020

1) Hold through earnings

2) Sell today and immediately buy shares, that way if there's a dip my percent loss is less significant compared to options. If we moon at least I'm still onboard for the ride. If no moon plan to convert those bought shares back to April options after IV cools down.",ddroukas,wallstreetbets,3349.0

I think most bag holders understand that the ideal scenario is that GME blows earnings out of the water and it triggers a short squeeze but also acknowledged that is not the most likely scenario. What makes this situation special is that if GME misses on earnings and the shares tank; Ryan Cohen has positioned himself for a takeover of the company and he has a really interesting plan to restructure GME. By ‚Äúpositioned for a takeover‚Äù I mean he has submitted his complaints to the board of directors as one of the largest stockholders. The GME board will either accept his suggestions (which would be amazing), ignore them (which would initiate a takeover), or blow earnings out of the water so dramatically that Ryan‚Äôs suggestions won‚Äôt matter to GME bag holders.

5,2020-12-10,"It was very feasible. Short borrow rate was going up along with stock price. Shit EPS was expected and thus priced in. GME did a test run for a rebranding the week before that made it seem likely to be announced on the call.

Cohens letter made it advantageous for the stock price to go up for management, as it would be more expensive for him to aquire more shares. It was likely they would respond to the letter to appease him and other major shareholders, which would have entailed more depth to the strat plan and how it was going in q4. Also, how they intend to shake off the short interest. And it was possible they would give more detail about the msft agreement and as a reach, other partnerships being pursued.


It wouldn't have been that bad of a call if it weren't for the shelf offering. It wasn't a guaranteed squeeze, but it was super feasible. I rolled my calls out to April and took a bit of profit. hurting right now but im still up massively over the last month on gme",Ackilles,wallstreetbets,5.0

GME needs more than 21st century retail to compete.  Their differentiator right now IS the fact that they are physical which targets a different set of shoppers.  That's a weak leg for the future. They need to be the Netflix of gaming, or the whole foods of gaming (premium store experience), or both.",Phlebotanist,wallstreetbets,46.0
47,2020-12-10,"Blockbuster literally stood still until Netflix hit them like a bus. By the time Blockbuster tried to pivot it was way way too late.

Blockbuster had zero interest in doing anything that competed with its stores.

If I look out a good distance I'd say yes, GME absolutely has major problems. Sure, this cycle isn't the end of physical disks but the next one might be. GME has time but they have to use it wisely. Their market has split into two streams and both of those streams are controlled by another company.

If GME had an Elon at the helm they'd make their own gaming console and start up a player centric game design house. Maybe some kind of PC/console hybrid. JUST moving to selling games online doesn't help longer term because Microsoft or Sony can steal that business away in a blink.

Having said all that, they're fine for this cycle and in fact i think their comps are going to be amazing. It's just not a stock I'd buy and put in a 401k or something. You have to watch what they're actually doing.",Objective_Stage,wallstreetbets,47.0
48,2020-12-10,"Blockbuster was late to change but the main reason they failed was resistance to closing stores, accumulating debt and an inability to continually pivot their central service model multiple times in the space of a few years.

Netflix got a billion and put it all into making the service as efficient as possible.  It was basically a lean post office.  Then they cut their legacy business off and invested deeply in online before it was clearly better than disc service, becoming the defacto streaming service and inventing a category.  They hit luck with the advent of smartphones and tablets and other orthogonal viewing methods.  When streaming started to become a lagging business they invested in content and went even farther away from a 'rental' company.  It's hard to change the identity and central mission of a company that many times in 17 years.

How would you apply this to GME? They need to find a new service model beyond retail.  They missed out on a Steam like service, even an also-ran like GOG or Epic Store.  They have to be ready to cut many more stores, maybe all stores, loose at some point as a declining business, and I'm not sure they can.

They had a digital sales platform in ""Impulse"" with Stardock, and were developing a streaming service with Spawn Labs up until it was cancelled in 2014.  They didn't lean into these concepts enough to execute effectively then and they missed out.  Retreated to a basic retail mentality. They didn't even focus on digital sales or defensive retail (like collectible games or exclusives).  They could have been the go-to place for VR and other premium hardware, prebuilt PCs etc.  Gaming Cafe, esports, anything.  Bad management during this period.  I think the current management is better but they don't have any plans to change service model.  Short squeeze or not, that means their business will eventually end.  They are running about as tight a ship as B&amp;M can and the shorts are premature, but time is fleeting.

I've always wondered, ironically, why Gamestop didn't just fucking rent games.  It may sound like moving backwards but they could have started a subscription service combining digital and physical rentals and sales, then transition to fully digital and layer streaming on top.  All the while their inventory of rentals would have complemented their used disc business until that was no longer viable.  And the foot traffic from exchanging discs (like Blockbuster's old option) would have driven in-store sales.  Probably past time to execute on this unless they pick a major partner, but this is assuming some kind of reverse merger situation.",Phlebotanist,wallstreetbets,48.0

 Nobody is going to care about Gamestop(tm) Ratings and Reviews as long as Youtube exists. Or Metacritic. Or Google. Anybody that reads reviews is going to go to a million places before they go to Gamestop. Whatever measly ""exclusives"" they come up with aren't going to make a dent in the massive sales from built-in marketplaces.

The one and only advantage Gamestop has is it's ability to make money off of used-game sales. Theoretically they have the ability to profit infinitely off of the same used game, it all depends on how many times that physical disc/cartridge is bought back and sold. Manufacturers only profit on the initial sale, and miss out on each subsequent return and repurchase. To combat this, they have pivoted to digital sales. Steam/EGS/GOG have dominated the PC gaming landscape to the point that physical PC games are pretty much extinct. Consoles are quickly following the same path. Before long, physical copies of video games are going to go the way of Betamax.

And the person that bought the shares never actually received them.  

Now, in practice, the broker just had to report it as FTD, and the shorter is still on the hook for the value of the shares.  When a stock appears on the threshold list, that ticker has now been highlighted as having a high potential for manipulation or other fuckery.

106,2020-12-10,"OK, you got my attention with the ""sitting on top of $600M cash w/ $1BN market cap.""

That sent me to the company's financials.  

[https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=GME&amp;qsearchterm=gme&amp;tab=financials](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=GME&amp;qsearchterm=gme&amp;tab=financials)

Yes, they have almost $600M in cash.  They also have current liabilities (debts that must be paid within the next year) of $1.6BN.  

They have other current assets (inventory, receivables, cash, etc) totaling $1.7BN, so you get a current ratio just above 1 to 1.  That's not horrible, but it's not a comfort of ""sitting on cash"" like Apple or Google.  

The actual ""book value"" or equity on the balance sheet (assets in excess of debts) is $300M.  The company lost $471M last year.  Thus the shorts.  It's on a trend to be insolvent if that doesn't turn around.  The company will have a negative net worth if it loses 2/3 of what it lost last year.

I haven't listened to the call or seen the full report from yesterday yet, so not sure what the turnaround plan is, just using what's available on CNBC as of last quarter.

I say all that to say this:  I still understand the theoretical value of the short squeeze if they're able to show strong performance this coming quarter.  But please understand for your own measurement of risk that this company isn't in great financial shape right now, and that cash on the balance sheet is already spoken for with matching liabilities.",One_Eyed_Man_King,wallstreetbets,106.0

201,2020-12-10,"I fully support screwing the hedge fund shorts because of the massive market manipulation and outright violations of securities laws perpetrated by them. GME as a company is a shithole. I hope the hedge fund shorts get fucked and people here get tendies, but don‚Äôt pretend that it‚Äôs not a shit company. 

Regarding your ‚Äúearly responses‚Äù (even though, again, I want the short squeeze to happen): 

1) RE: Best Buy/ Wal-Mart. False equivalence. Both of those stores sell things other than video games and video game accessories, like the items that actually make them money (appliances, TVs, audio for both stores; Wal-Mart also has groceries, clothing, outdoor gear, sporting gear, shitty knick knacks). Neither Wal-Mart nor Best Buy rely on video game shit to maintain their bottom line. Try ordering a washing machine on Amazon and let me know how that works out for you. 

2) RE: Digital vs physical games. The article linked doesn‚Äôt support your assertion in the slightest. UK retailers reported that 25% of their supply was the cheaper digital only console. That‚Äôs all it says. It has no reference to any data on actual consumer preferences. However, digital downloads of games are at their highest point ever. As of October, digital download revenues were up [14%](https://www.superdataresearch.com/blog/worldwide-digital-games-market)year over year. That‚Äôs a trend that has continued every single year for at least a decade. It‚Äôs not reversing. Physical games are going the way of the audio cassette. Sorry if that is hard to accept. 

3) Bonds. This isn‚Äôt determinative of financial health or future bankruptcy. The company could (and should) pivot to embracing more fully the online distribution universe. It‚Äôs good they are currently reducing debt. If other trends continue, however, the cost cutting measures responsible for such debt reduction will only go so far. 

TL;DR: Fuck the hedge fund shorts they deserve to eat their losses and feed us for a change. But also don‚Äôt hang your hat on GME as anything other than a shit company with a dinosaur business model that treats their employees like shit. It‚Äôs not exactly a solid long term investment. But I‚Äôm all for tendies in the near future.",TastyCuttlefish,wallstreetbets,201.0

203,2020-12-10,"Hey so I've been looking at calls and puts on some memestocks and noticing I can't afford them so I've been trying to find some that are a cent per share. 
Red flags everywhere I know, but I already learned the hard way how they can become worthless, but as a newbie trader on rh I've been analyzing the fuck out of a bunch of random stocks around the 1-4 dollar range, and noticing some options going up 13000% and down 99%. I've been trying my hardest to seperate those of which are simply going to expire worthless, and those of which that just randomly swing from a cent to 1.30.

The thing I think I need to feel out is which options people are going to maybe want in the future that seem unfeasible in the present, considering their single cent premium. 
The only risk is that it will expire worthless and I lose 1 dollar per contract. While this is not risky in the short term of options, say if I'm doing 200 contacts for 200 bucks though, each call could expire worthless. So I'm finding my sweet spot in terms of time, looking for stocks that have option premiums at a penny a year or more out, so that throughout the year I can monitor which have drastic spikes and which remain at the original penny, claiming my stake back. So I'm new and possibly not thinking a buncha shit out but I wanted to get this out to you guys up be critiqued. 

I've been doing this with GME calls and puts today, but I guess I'll update yall how it goes this week. Only starting with 30 bucks tho cause I just lost 500 out of my 600 on pltr calls lmao",Defiant-Parsnip,wallstreetbets,203.0

The main catalyst is done (so all the meme status/short squeeze theory is still the main thing). IV has most likely dropped and will begin to expand in the coming weeks. This means at any point GME will most likely have some sort of big move (in either direction).

I would recommend anyone to take advantage of expanding IV by looking into calendar spreads and diagonal spreads. What makes GME so great (as a premium seller) is how stupid high the IV is. 

Purchasing LEAPs and shorting calls against it would be a good option. Buy-writes (covered calls) or selling cash-secured puts would also be a great move. You can use any premium to fund FDs if you insist (I do not recommend). 

If PLTR has a big move where I am forced out of my position, I will look into getting into GME if its still low(ish). It's impossible to resist that IV.",OnlyWangs,wallstreetbets,416.0

This idea has a name - it‚Äôs called a proxy campaign. You can google that. You need to file w the SEC and register (I don‚Äôt know if ‚Äògroup of 20-something trading fractional shares and derivatives‚Äô is a registered party, but fuck it who cares?). Then you have the right to solicit the rest of the investor base to vote in a slate of directors that will do your bidding. 

Here‚Äôs the fun part: the filing alone costs about $100k in filing fees and legal fees. And now you‚Äôre just getting started.....

You need to hire board reps, advisors, lawyers, marketers, etc etc. A normal proxy fight costs at least $1M and some have gone up as high as $20M to $30M.....oh yeah *and you can still lose it all too.*

So I‚Äôd love to know where you all plan on coming up with the money to fight this and what your pitch to Fidelity, Blackrock, Vang, SIG and the rest of the top GME holders will be.

Ex.

GME: 45% shares
Cohen: 35%
Other: 20%

*Buyback*

GME +5%
Other -5%

*dilution*

Other: +5%

So now there‚Äôs 105% of the existing shares, but the regular investor still owns roughly the same number as they did previously as well as Cohen, but GME has a slightly larger controlling interest now, being up to 50% of the 105% of shares. Plus, it cost them little to nothing.

I‚Äôd wager this move wasn‚Äôt for shareholders and instead for the corporate members who see their larger investors trying to use their shareholder sway to force ideas GME doesn‚Äôt want.

1307,2020-12-09,"When I decide to jump ship or not I look at what is the reason for the drop? If it makes sense and might continue, then I think about jumping ship. If not, I buy more or hold tight.

GOOD: Here, the earnings were better than expected (although sales were down, costs were down more) the company is shifting towards omnichannel bullshit (which is good), and consoles and major releases are going to happen next quarter. 

BAD: Sales were down (probably because of the pandemic and no COD like last year, but who knows), stores are closing (they spun that as cost cutting, and that may be good, but it may be bad too) and they announced a shelf offering of $100m - those are all potentially bad.  Does the bad outweigh the good to justify the drop?

Factors:
1) Sales dropping compared to last year is bad, full stop. But it is also explainable in that there is a pandemic this year (which is bad for specialty shops because people don't want to make unnecessary trips), no 3Q major game release, etc. Next quarter will have consoles and associated major releases (which 4Q 2020 did not have). The sales next quarter are going to very good. 
2) Stores closing is potentially bad, but potentially good. Reducing costs can, as evidenced by this ER, be a very effective way to increase profits even if sales drop. Gamestop's physical footprint is probably too big to survive in an online world, so I tend to think this is a good thing. 
3) The shelf offering is potentially bad for the short squeeze but I wasn't thinking that was a certainty anyways. But, as others have pointed out, it is small enough that it wouldn't make much impact on the short % and it might also suggest that GME is aware of the potential short squeeze and wants to capitalize on it. It also seems like we are in a market that doesn't care about share dilution (see Carnival, Tesla, etc. - which were WAY WAY more diluted than this offering would dilute GME). 

I don't think this drop makes sense given the new info.  A small drop because of the lower sales and the new offering would make sense. But bad 3Q earnings were already priced into the price before the ER was released so a slight increase because of that would have made sense too. A larger gain would have made sense as well, based on optimism about the push towards increasing their online model. 

Another option is that the price was already inflated a bit. It jumped from like $10-11 since the beginning of November. So maybe we were a little ahead of where we should have been based purely on optimism. But I saw very little to make me concerned about GME in this ER. To the contrary, I'm more bullish than I was yesterday.

Here's what I am going to do: 
Sell covered calls with a strike well above my cost basis, using my shares as collateral. I'm holding until at least April and then reevaluating.",Turokk8001,wallstreetbets,1307.0
1308,2020-12-09,"So, it's too late for most of you who are already dead from buying GME FDs, but here is a good play to use options to speculate without losing your entire account.

6 days ago I bought 10 25/30 call spreads, expiring April. These have a max loss of $70 per spread, max gain of $430 per spread. I offset this cost by selling 2 $35 calls for $245 each. 

So now, if the stock stays below $25, I lose $700 from the spreads, but gain $490 from the sold calls, so I only lose $210.

If the stock closes in April between 30 and 35, I make $4300 on the spreads and $490 from the sold calls. 

If the stock goes above 35, I still make $4300 from the spreads, and I start losing money on the sold calls, but I'm still profitable unless the stock goes above ~59. Obviously above 59 I have unlimited loss potentially, but it hasn't been above 59 since 2007, and I would just close the position if this somehow looked possible.

So, $210 max loss, $4790 max gain unless the stock goes up 350% in the next four months.",masterlich,wallstreetbets,1308.0

1359,2020-12-09,"Thank you. I discovered it when looking for GME posts under New in WSB. Only a few people were even talking about it but I just took a quick look at the financials and saw that its P/S ratio was really low compared to its competitors. Their YOY growth wasn‚Äôt crazy but it was decent. These were possible indicators that this stock was undervalued and the lack of mention of it on this sub made me figure it was flying under the radar for now. I discovered it the day before earnings on Monday, and it had already flown 15% on the Friday before so I knew it was starting to get valid attention. On the day of earnings, it dropped about 15% despite a great ER so I knew it was a matter of time before it rebounded and I jumped in at $24.41 after selling GME. I watched it skyrocket on Tuesday and just took profits at $28.6 (it peaked at $29.11) because I figured it‚Äôs not hyped enough to not have a pullback after such a big jump. I definitely wanna jump back in as it has so much more room to grow. I can‚Äôt say what the price target will be for the short term because it might keep flying under the radar for a while, but I think this stock can EASILY hit a $10B market cap over the long term when looking at its revenue compared to its competitors. A $10B market cap would make the price about $100, though I‚Äôm sure there will be dips along the way. I don‚Äôt know when it‚Äôll hit that, but I‚Äôm confident it‚Äôll definitely be in less than 12 months. As long as Sumo‚Äôs growth stays good, it will prob keep climbing past $100 after a year.

I think you're absolutely right that all the Cohen story writeup marketing moments were planned and part of this larger play concerning GameStop. But I also could see, something like the share dilution option being talked about on purpose to manipulate the price down to have **MORE shorts pile in**. 

Like, why did we say we're going to dilute the value of the company? **To bring more shorts to the slaughter of MOASS.** That's why we did this. Make the shorts feel secure, before all this good news happens around Cohen. Like Sherman, is likely not dumb, and talks to the board and can see the writing on the wall. So, he might ask, well if I'm going to get canned, how can we kick my ass out the door that makes you and I richer? You have to imagine, there are people at GME that are ON-FUCKING-BOARD with the Cohen vision. But, as is theater, how do we generate the moment where we express to the world the GME is turning the ship around. And turning around, HARD. We have to have a big event.

At some point this is all speculative/conspiracy theory blatherings. BUT BUT BUT, if you can have FUCKING PATIENCE, in your investing choices, I see no reason why GME would not be worth &gt;$25 SP in a year. And you know ... even if MOASS doesn't happen.

11,2020-12-11,"Look man, I appreciate that the funding and the feasibility of all of this based on your assessment of the merits of the transaction is your area of expertise.  It's a very useful perspective.  I appreciate seeing it.

But my GME thesis, such as it is, is pretty simple: Short sellers are highly overleveraged expecting a bankruptcy that is not coming in the near term, suppressing the true value of the market cap for a company with GME's revenue and debt profile and potential to return to profitability, (or at least dramatically increase revenue) with this console cycle, pandemic buying and holiday season with a likely payoff with a large Q4 number that seems very likely to raise the price above  $14 (or at $10 when I first started buying) and that April calls have a pretty good chance of printing.  That's my target and I think it's a sound one.

The Cohen thing is just the icing on the cake here and the most interesting thing going right now in my view in this boring ass world we find ourselves in.  I'm genuinely fascinated at how this is playing out and do not know what to make of that letter other than a pretty direct signal that he and Chris Davis are at least going to try something.  Now, I know fuck-all about how any of that shit would play out.  I thought the consent solicitation thing was pretty clever and seemed like the kind of play that could make sense here, but as a few people pointed out, and as I edited above, that's not likely to be feasible here either. Live and Learn.  A consent solicitation, what will you crazy finance dudes think up next?  And I appreciate my solid associates on the board here running that down for me.  Throw in two steak sandwiches and bill it to the Underhill account, boys.

So I don't really know what's going to happen.  But my guess is they're going to try something.  Just seems like something Cohen wants to do.  And whether they can successfully pull it off? It sounds like you have some very reasonable doubts.  And you may very well be right.  But I guess I'm willing to give Chris Davis some credit here.  And since Cohen's intent seemed pretty goddamn unmistakable in that letter, maybe Cohen is just gonna YOLO this.  I don't have any fucking idea.  But if he gives it a shot, this thing goes to the moon.  How long it stays there and whether Cohen can actually build this business, I don't really care.  I'll worry about that later. And that, combined with my ""thesis"" above, doesn't seem all that broken.  But I suppose it's all a matter of perspective.  I could stand to have a bit more humility.  Couldn't we all, right?

And I hope I was clear that I know next to nothing about corporate law.  I'm merely a simple government contracts litigator in DC and we tend to write a lot and write quickly, so this is really for my amusement more than anything because I think it's fun and interesting.  It seems like you do too.  So let's chill a bit and just have fun with this.  None of this matters a goddamn bit anyway.

And I've been opposite folks from Skadden a few times, though bid protests aren't really their thing.  But those guys were all dicks and also a bit out of their depth and it wasn't all that much fun.  But I bet your friend is a good guy, because you seem really cool.

99,2020-12-11,"I am party to consent solicitations all the time. They are extremely common in the debt and structure fin world whenever you need a majority vote to change the terms of an outstanding security. I can‚Äôt think of a scenario where that‚Äôs been done with a huge public company like GME. It‚Äôs almost always reg d securities. If it has been done, it‚Äôs probably with tiny troubled companies. So is it technically possible? Sure? Do I think it‚Äôs likely? Probably not. But I may well be wrong. 

But think this through: let‚Äôs say Cohen is going to flip the board. Let‚Äôs say he pushes through a new board that will turn GME into a strictly digital game delivery platform. That means he‚Äôs not buying the company - what‚Äôs your upside case? If he goes through with getting a new board, nobody can buy GME outright and you can‚Äôt take it private bc the cash flow sucks. Like what a realistic earnings power in FY22-FY24? And the thing is, you also need to explain why the pg1 holders won‚Äôt dump GME in mass when

There‚Äôs a reason that PE firms do these transactions off public markets. I work these structures all the time - even in a best case scenario, you burn all the equity and rest on contingent debt. This is a fancy way of saying you zero-value the equity (the hypothetical stock would go to zero) and super-sub convert debt provides floor to the cap structure. If you do this as a public company, your stock - by definition - goes to zero/pennies.  Once you have flipped the business and you are again flowing cash, you regenerate your equity position when you IPO and recapitalize. 

There are no hedge funds mutual funds or etf trustees that can bear that type of loss. That‚Äôs why PE/VC do 7-10 limited life funds that are fully locked; all of those pg1 holders are marked-to-market. So part of this consent solicitation thesis is that you‚Äôre also flipping the entire investment base. The share price isn‚Äôt going UP during that process. 

TLDR: Cohen cannot do this transformation as a public company and there‚Äôs no way he‚Äôs taking private in a normal-way levered deal. The *only* way this works is if he is willing to stake up like $600M to $800M. To get a worthwhile return, he‚Äôd have to IPO for (I don‚Äôt know) like $5B in a few years. Is that possible? Sure, maybe that‚Äôs possible. What are you willing to bet on it? It‚Äôs also possible the NY Giants win the Super Bowl this year. What are you willing to bet on that?

And I‚Äôm genuinely not trying to haze you or play ‚ÄúI‚Äôm big brain‚Äù. One of the hard lessons you learn is that when your thesis breaks, you get out of the trade. Chasing a broken thesis is the #1 way you get fired from a fund. It‚Äôs an important lesson to learn: when you get beat, learn from it and move on

In what should be GME‚Äôs best quarter in years (pandemic forcing everyone to stay home, gaming popularity and revenue at all time high, huge hype and buildup for next gen consoles), their revenue dropped 30% and they posted a loss.

Do all the GME holders not realize people want convenience?

139,2020-12-10,"A lot of those guys you listed are generally thematic top-down investors. Not saying they wouldn‚Äôt take a swing at this, but it‚Äôs just hard for me to see a no-experience first timer like Cohen being able to build a coalition. I mean maybe he could, I just don‚Äôt see it. 

Also remember that *most* (like 80%-90%) of activism is transactional eg, sell that asset, merge w that company, do a special divvy, initiate a buyback - ‚Äúdo a specific and defined thing and I‚Äôll go away.‚Äù ‚ÄúSell your assets and completely reinvent the business from the bottom up in a orthogonal space you have zero experience in‚Äù is a flavor of activism that is *really* unusual. Like I‚Äôm having a hard time thinking of a comparable example. 

On the surface GME and, say, Steam might *seem* similar, but if you think about it, those are *wildy* different businesses. It would be like telling a coal mining company to sell all their assets and start building solar plants; both activities are *related* to generating electricity but the engineering/expertise/business/human/mechanical/knowledge/etc portions of those two activities are way way way fucking different. Something of that flavor is much more like a PE- takeout and turnaround, which is like a ~5yr play; you‚Äôd never even consider doing that as a public company. However, Cohen aside, none of the funds you listed would take a 5yr illiquid bite. 

So, therefore, the biggest issue to a takeout is money; there‚Äôs no way this can get financing without a massive equity chunk. That‚Äôs hands down the biggest obstacle. GME is a shitty business in a bad space, and the gameplan is to liquidate all the assets that would secure the debt? Hmmmmm.....not so sure about that. And they can‚Äôt do a hostile tender - that‚Äôs not even really a thing anymore. GME would just bleed him down. 

Look - I make mistakes all the time, and I‚Äôm not an activist/equity guy by trade, so I could easily be wrong. And I do honestly hope he makes money - I LOVE novel investment theories particularly when the work. But I just don‚Äôt see it here.",Laminar_flo,wallstreetbets,139.0

I understand that these passive funds, and even the managed funds within those firms aren't going to back a proxy battle.  But, if I go through the other big holders, you have: Cohen, Donald Foss, Burry, Must, Permit, Hestia, Senvest, Maverick, Paradice, etc... it seems like you're starting to get to substantial numbers.

But, you're absolutely right.  Why in the world would you start with DOMO?

160,2020-12-10,"As someone who has been invested in gaming for 25 years, been through the introduction and current state of esports and the transition to digital?

Gamestop is 5 years too late. This transition should have started 10 years ago and finished 5 years ago. They transitioned instead to Chinesium garbage that nobody buys. Anytime I would go in, all that crap is covered in dust. They refused to put money into future-proofing their business. Now they are behind in console availability to Bestbuy and Walmart. 

People keep yelling from the rooftops about how $GME is going to explode; they've been failing for five years. They are losing a huge amount of physical walk-in sales (which also means less chinesium trash being impulse purchased). Autists keep screaming ""BuT mIcrOSoFt GiBs 30%!!2@!2112"". 

Guess what. Xbox is largely going to lose this console cycle purely on an exclusivity front. Microsoft has already stated there will be zero exclusives on XBox because they have them available for PC through the Microsoft store. The fanboy-ism of consoles and PC are dying; the kids growing up didn't have the console wars many of us had growing up in the early gaming years. The gaming community is becoming far more tolerant of eachothers fandom (as seen through the subreddits this console release, both sides hyping eachother like never before). 

With how many consoles are going digital, $GME is going to suffer game sales; it's a fact of life. That means **at least** 7 years of reduced game sales. That is fucking **MONUMENTAL**. People are going to buy through the Console stores because they have the ability to refund you because they have the ability to remove that game from your Library (unless you plan on never using the internet). 

GME will never be a big or noticeable name in the platform or esports space. They are so far behind that companies have just created their own ecosystems that are completely autonomous from outside players. Nobody is going to go to a fucking Gamestop esports tournament when they are going on **EVERYWHERE**. Nobody is going to pay GME to watch shit when they can watch directly through Twitch, in-game or through that games website. 

Maybe if they got on this train 10 years ago. But I wouldn't bet on them doing anything of value in any aspect of the gaming scene. Gamestop died when midnight releases died. Now they're just holding on while WSB financially supports them lol.",Rubu_,wallstreetbets,160.0

I‚Äôll be honest, I read up to the DOMO capital part. I‚Äôll give you my 2c on the on the part I read. 

Chris Davis may/may not be a BSD in proxy law, but I‚Äôve definitely never heard of him. That doesn‚Äôt really mean anything, but it is a fact that he‚Äôs not at one of the ‚Äòbig daddy‚Äô firms like skadden, wachtell or cravath. If I saw one of those firms at the table, I might feel a little different. And besides, any lawyer is gonna take cohens $750/hr even if the case is pretty hopeless. 

To H2C holdings - there‚Äôs actually something to learn here. In a proxy battle, who owns the shares is *everything* and the strategy is ‚Äòhow do I flip those shares?‚Äô

Go to H**C‚Äôs 12/31/19 holdings list, and look at its ownership structure (edit - I posted this comment previously w the correct ticker but my comment got rejected. I‚Äôm reposting again edited). Focus on the fact that it was only about 30% institutionally held and the rest was either insider or closely-held. This makes it *really* easy to wage a proxy battle bc you have fewer plain vanilla longs to fight (PVLs almost never vote to join proxy fights unless one of the big proxy advisors issues a public judgement). Put differently, you have to herd fewer cats and the shares you have to flip are not encumbered by *massive* institutional bureaucracies. 

Contrast that with GME, which is about 99% institutional (ignoring the short double). Your top 5 holders, representing about 40% of shares (Fido, blkr, vang, sig, dim adv) are *never* going to vote for a new slate under these circumstances. 

The big longs simply won‚Äôt take a unilateral side in a proxy fight. So Fido just won‚Äôt do it, and blkr/vang/dim adv are holding into etfs and separately managed accts, meaning they will either ‚Äòno vote‚Äô or straight up vote ‚Äòno‚Äô.  SIG is transactional and is probably already out by now. If you keep going down, you can say the same with state street, msam, and norges. They won‚Äôt get on board with a fight. 

The only way to get PVLs (and trust/etf managers) to vote for a proxy action is to get a proxy advisory firm to take your side, like a glass-Lewis or ISS (in fact, this is institutional policy at just about all mutual funds). And this is a HUGE undertaking particularly given what Cohen is asking, and the fact that proxy adv firms are insanely conservative in their recommendations. 

I just don‚Äôt see it happening. 

And I quit at DOMO advisors being involved. I looked DOMO advisors and according to Bloomberg, they have a *WHOPPING* $13M (not a typo) under management. That‚Äôs.....a rounding error. It‚Äôs just not enough money to matter by a factor of like 100x. If I took a $13M trade to my CIO, they‚Äôd assume I was drunk (again). That‚Äôs DOMOs entire book. 

Which begs the question: why the fuck did anyone even bring in DOMO - why not somebody that matters? Why didn‚Äôt Cohen pitch this to 3rd Point or Greenlight? They are dying for ideas - they (almost certainly) would have taken the meeting. 

Teaming up with a nobody for a proxy war is like a dude at a bar saying, ‚Äúoh yeah, I regularly bang supermodels in Paris - like all the time. I‚Äôve also got Kendall Jenner on speed dial....Anyway if you need me, I‚Äôll be hanging out in the mall in front of the Hot Topic hitting on 13yr olds.‚Äù The words just don‚Äôt match the actions by a long shot. 

Tons of activist firms would have taken the meeting....but I guess they didn‚Äôt? Or they did and don‚Äôt like the setup (this far more likely). 

Either way, I‚Äôll keep following this bc I love good Corp drama. Good luck - and I don‚Äôt mean that snarkily.",Laminar_flo,wallstreetbets,184.0

You cannot claim the full standard deduction of $12,400. The max you can claim if solely have unearned income (that includes your mad capital STCG):

$1,100

IOW that sweet $70,000 profit you made on one trade is subject to your income tax bracket for STCG.

For 2020 and in your case that will either be 35% or 37% of your ""profit"" from the trade. And don't get me started on wash sale rules, K-1s, royalties, basis adjustments, qualified dividend rates, and the AMT.

So $70,000  - .37(70,000) = $44,100 profit in actuality and you better damn well have that $25,900 for that transaction when the tax man doth come knocking!

It's easy when you're making that much to ""invest"" it elsewhere and suddenly it disappears in a jizz of GME calls when April payday comes for the government. And that six month extension doesn't stop the need to pay, pay interest, and pay fees. So make an installment agreement with them when that time comes and hope you're not a dependent.

The ""short squeeze"" is kind of a red herring in the sense that it's what's been driving the stock price up all along. The stakes are still plenty high for shorts even after the most recent drop, and they're going to keep tapping out unless they anticipate an additional negative catalyst.

The rest do as you like with, but a cool $50k to day trade with for some easy and massive trades will be joyous because if shit turns south you're gonna likely owe the IRS and hate yourself for not taking a safe level of massive profit when you had the chance.

Srsly though, throwing no shade zoomer bby, take out fiddy percent and put it in some boomer shit like treasuries or MSFT equities.

418,2020-12-10,"the trend is downwards if you compare each spike. I suspect this is attributable to the increase percentage of purchases being made direct by the consumer through MS and Sony. Couple this with the supply chain issues artificially created by organized groups buying up the units and reselling them at 3x the price, which I believe will have as big or bigger negative impact on GME sales as the direct-to-consumer sales.

433,2020-12-10,"&gt; These homeboys need to revamp their business model or they‚Äôll fizzle. 

There are so many goddamn things they could do that will turn them around: 

- Pivot towards an online revenue model (their deal with MSFT was the first step)
- Cater towards PC rig building instead of game reselling
- Bundle their offerings with access to esport events to continue holding recognition

The pivot towards an online revenue model is something that everyone is keenly aware of, and Cohen especially hammered it home in his letter to the board. 

But another side is something that I've only seen somebody else mention in passing but is a great opportunity for Gamestop - hardware/peripherals:

3 billion people are gamers worldwide, and a [whopping 48% of them play on PCs](https://www.extremetech.com/gaming/314009-3-billion-people-worldwide-are-gamers-and-nearly-half-play-on-pcs) - nearly 1.5 billion people.

The transition to digital only copies is really seen more on PC than on consoles; to keep closing down stores without addressing this fundamental failure means ignoring this trend. But here's the kicker: 

**The profit margin for PC games aren't necessarily the games themselves but the hardware.**

NVDA, AMD, and CRSR are making money hand over fist because of the gaming market. Why GME isn't seeking out a partnership with them to have access to day-1 hardware and peripherals to make those products more readily available to consumers should have been a no-brainer. 

Gamestop's brand recognition and surprisingly clean balance sheet give them a stronger negotiating position power to start properly catering to the PC gaming crowd *beyond* just re-selling games, which--as mentioned--is a dead end that's going nowhere.

Then throw in stuff like headphones, gaming mice, mics, cables, etc. all of those little peripheral electronics that have huge profit margins - how do you think BestBuy is staying in business? It's not from selling TVs and phones, it's from selling cables.",bestgopmemes,wallstreetbets,433.0

all the boomers and even millennials do not understand that console gaming and PC gaming are fundamentally different due to the difference in core market strategy.

Its a competition between the consoles, not games, And thats why there‚Äôs such a huge emphasis on first-party games.

8,2020-12-12,"&gt; 1) Cash flow is everything in a company. No money, no growth. 

depends

GME is a good example of having cash, but no growth. a lot of their cash has come from selling off inventory, their corporate jet, and the main headquarters in grapevine (which they've leased back). they've also cut executive salaries and cleaned up their accounts payable

they're sitting on a shit-ton of cash because of streamlining the company processes, yet their revenues throughout the year have been down significantly. their gross margins also suffered in 2017 and most of 2018, until they sold off the spring mobile business at the end of 2018, which they had acquired in 2014:

https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamestop-acquires-wireless-company-spring-mobile/1100-6416309/

in 2019, the current management came in. gross margins improved significantly, and were looking up until the pandemic hit:

https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/gross-margin

in the last earnings report, it was mentioned that month november comparable sales are up 16% Y/Y, likely due to the new console cycle, which might be a good sign

i think it would be better to compare to the previous console years. nevertheless, the CEO mentioned that this will be a strong quarter

looking forward, it is highly unlikely the company goes bankrupt as they are well-positioned financially, and, again, the new console cycle will give them a boost

the company and the stock mechanics are separate though. as an example, most of big tech posted great earnings last quarter, but all of their stocks were dropped after and have remained mostly flat

GME stock movements are highly unpredictable. it does strange shit, and this is why placing bets on it is foolhardy. what's more is that everyone and their grandma knows GME shoots up during console cycles, and that's why the financial media, cramer, etc. will shit on the company more to shake people out, and introduce doubt

logically, yes, the company should do well the next quarter, along with most of retail, and GME in particular because of the new console cycle

88,2020-12-12,"Yeah exactly. This investor day thing is an annual thing and generally the option market is good with pricing in movements (implied move) of a stock which is where the IV of an option comes from as well. For this situation they weren't pricing in a very big move from what I remember, like ~5% on the weeklies.

Whatever underlying you're thinking of trading, check historic IV to see if what you're paying buying is expensive.(google will show a number of sites like options slam and market chameleon). There are stocks with IV still well over 150% months out or even year out cuz the biz/stock is that nature (think GME, Chinese EV stock, TSLA, etc.) So it isn't always due to time or whether or not it's ITM. It's more on how that stock moves and what the market price the movement will be during that contract period. (But more time buys more stability so IV is generally less).

While more stable stock will have IV at like 30-50% ranges. Often times when WSB talks about IV crush is when we buy into silly weekly contracts with 300% IV.

PS3 and PS4 had more supply and better games. PS4 games still look great, but it's a moot point because you can't get your hands on a system. This is a dead duck. 

But, but they have Chewbaca as a major investor, going to be ecommerce now! Listen, if it was that easy, he would have created 10 ""new"" ecommerce giants. Same for Bezos. 

But the second greatest short is coming! Ya think? Maybe, seems like a dumb bet when you have tons of other stock making nice weekly gains. But go ahead and bank on this short happening. 

Lastly, Gamestop is semi hated across their base. Gamers have bitched for years about their low value trades but they were the only game(stop) in town. Literally the main reason anyone went to Gamestop, is going away rapidly. But yes, please tell your family and friends at xmas to go all in. Buy shares!

My issues here are GME specific: 1st time activist w an *insane* thesis that can‚Äôt be conventionally funded sitting w a coinvestment table that won‚Äôt support the thesis. Remember that making money isn‚Äôt about what‚Äôs *possible* - it‚Äôs about (probability x return). Again it‚Äôs possible that the giants win the super bowl, but you‚Äôre not betting that bc you know that (probability x return) is shit. 

Is it possible that Cohen gets a seat on the board? Sure. But the next 18-24mo of GME are FAR more likely to be a vanilla old-retail turnaround story (eg stronger aggregate cash flow % on a smaller asset base) as opposed to a wild ‚Äòblow it all up‚Äô story, and if it *does* turn into a ‚Äòblow it up‚Äô story, the stock isn‚Äôt going UP in the near term. 

On the surface, I‚Äôm unlikely to put in debt anywhere into that cap structure bc it just looks obviously wrong to me. But again, equities aren‚Äôt my space. On the credit side, I‚Äôve avoided both NFLX and TSLA - so far I‚Äôve been (happily) wrong on both.

***Anti-Takeover Provisions***

*Charter*

Our  charter and bylaws may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a  tender offer or takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider in  its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a  premium over the market price for the shares held by stockholders. Our charter contains a provision expressly  stating that we are not subject to Section¬†203 of the Delaware General  Corporation Law, which would otherwise restrict certain transactions  with an interested stockholder.

*Stockholder Action; Special Meeting Of Stockholders*

Our  charter and bylaws further provide that special meetings of our  stockholders may be called only by the Chairman of the Board of  directors, the Chief Executive Officer or a majority of the board of directors.

*Authorized But Unissued Shares*

The  authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock are  available for future issuance without stockholder approval. These additional shares may be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes,  including future public offerings to raise additional capital, corporate  acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized  but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt  to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer,  merger or otherwise.",UserNameTag,wallstreetbets,276.0

280,2020-12-11,"If they fail to grow their revenue and hold on to unprofitable assets and revenue continues to decline like it is now, it won't matter how much cash they currently have. They will face inevitable bankruptcy.

Their latest financial quarter reveals that they have managed to gather enough cash to sustain their business. But for GMEs case, that is simply not enough. They must invest a lot of money into e-commerce and product diversification.

The transition is going to be costly. In this scenario, their leverage proves to be a burden. 
If it was a growing business with a good credit rating, it wouldn‚Äôt have mattered. Companies that are growing aggressively are frabkly some of the most leveraged companies there is(think Tesla, Nio etc).

But they are neither growing nor have the best of credit rating.

Which makes it difficult for them to borrow for growth or to shift their business model.

So yes, definitely they are still overly leveraged. In fact, I would say this is one of the main problem for GME along with management inertia.

Think from an analysts pov. GME may have positive cash flows 3-4 quarters, but then it will keep on being on red(if things stay the same). Along with declining revenue, this immediately screams doom and gloom to any financial analyst.",nafizzaki,wallstreetbets,280.0

317,2020-12-11,"&gt;You lose if GME Moons or Floors

Floors, yes.  ""Losing"" if it moons is kind of relative.  20k shares called away at $16 would be $50k profit, plus the $33k in option premium so $83k profit on an initial investment of $270k.  Considering that GME only hit 13.5 for the first time in October, that's a 30% return in 3 months and all his capital freed back up.

Sure, it could technically still be considered a ""loss"" compared to the possible returns if GME goes full retard and his 30 by January, but it's hard to call a 30% return in 3 months a losing proposition.  Certainly not the same kind of losing as if it plummets.",sirisaacnuton,wallstreetbets,317.0

Nah, if he were going to do a takeover he would have done it right near the end of the last console cycle when GME hit 3 something.

Also, hostile takeovers are rare because they're hard. The current board can do all kinds of things to make it virtually impossible to buy a controlling share of the stock. Cohen could run an alternate slate of board members but...that's a lot of work, lawyer time, bad feelings, upheaval, etc.

IF they're going that route it sure as hell won't be now. It will be in like 3-5 years when the console cycle is near the bottom again and some fully digital console is looming and GME still depends on physical disks or some shit.

I know people like to think GME management is stupid but they're not. They know they've got a nice ramp in front of them for some time. They literally told you in the press release they're about to unleash 20% positive comps in the next ER. I think it will be closer to 30%, maybe even 40%.

1) Cohen will never get the financing for any kind of buyout and that the only true underlying asset is the brand.  

2) The ATM is a strong signal from the board that they are sticking with Sherman for now.

3) Transforming GME into some kind of Steam alternative through a buyout would be a terrible use of capital and hard to do publicly (real WS has no patience for that kind of stuff)

Other WSBers - listen to /u/laminar_flo - maybe this stock can be memed to some kind of interesting outcome but the fundamentals are terrible and this takeover thing seems to be out of steam in the short-run.",testing484848,wallstreetbets,367.0

150,2020-12-12,"Pivot to what? Where? They can't just pivot to anything.

What value? What growth?

There are other industries besides tech you know. Some are far from recovered and won't until the vaccine is widely available.

The revenue sharing thing was a life line bc they sell Xbox shit. GME has no leverage here. The MSFT deal was a nothing burger and could end up costing them if they're data is vulnerable. That's their best asset.

The only thing GME has going for it is a retail outlet that funnels all things gaming into it. Nothing else, it's all is ever had. It's still brick and mortar located all over the country with expensive leases in areas where foot traffic is declining or today is non existent.

And while competing with steam, Sony, Microsoft, Google, apple ECT....

The PlayStation being available without a disk drive is a huge indicator.

I can now buy my kids games without leaving the house or putting in any effort. Parents are busy which partly why they're losing market share. Internet is just getting faster and more available.

&gt;The call they had for Q3, they said this upcoming quarter will be the best they‚Äôve had in years. Not sure why I would sell on that level of strength. Until demand for the consoles slow or Ryan Cohen throws in the towel on a take over. The opportunity risk is too great.

That's exactly why you would sell. Why do you think it dumped on earnings? Stock is literally a vehicle for forward thinking growth potential. It's for what an investor believes a company will be worth not what it is worth. That's all priced in.

I made some money on them too but my advice is take out your investment and let the rest ride. This is a dead company in the evolving sector of retail.

All it'll take is for a couple of the big names to jump ship or board members cashing out and it's done. Microsoft to say they're not printing hard copies anymore or a dozen other things. They could go into the distressed credit for bailouts. You could easily see a -50% week on GME.

If you're saying bc a lot of the market is overvalued, which I agree, therefore most likely GME would overvalued be too. It's only undervalued relative to it's holdings not to it's growth potential.

The Tesla squeezes are different, there's growth and a catalyst. VW completely different scenario. What is GME going to pivot to to make up that difference? Where do they go from here?

GME needs a catalyst to break out otherwise it's simply going to slide with volatility based on news. There needs to be an upside, forward looking growth past ""we sell games and consoles and are used selection of basically free for us besides the cost of shelf space"". In fact a lot of the youngest generation isn't even into video games like millennials and Gen X are and are competing with YouTube, twitch and apps for their attention. That's GME's growth market which may not really be there for them come 2030.

There's plays that are likely to double in 2021 but brick and mortar is going to continue to slide. That's my opinion and if you've got cash you want parked in GME, your call and I honestly do wish you luck but I'm going after growth for 2021.

But really, how can you look at this situation and not be blown away those two companies have like 20 years of growth and inflation priced in or GME is criminally undervalued lol",Ackilles,wallstreetbets,183.0

188,2020-12-12,"What‚Äôs crazy to me about this chart is we have HALF the amount of shares as they did in 2013, higher demand for the xboxes/ps5s then the last console cycle, GameStop has $600m in cash (now about $475 from paying down a ton of debt on Friday), and short interest is hovering at an all time high. That console spike should be so much higher than anything they have ever seen. GameStop has a market cap of $900m currently. They will bring in multiples of that in Q4 alone. Long GME and likely will add to my position (2,614 shares @ $5.58 currently)",Kwc0055,wallstreetbets,188.0

Well I guess you're going to become the next millionaire on WSB  üòÇ 

If we do our part and give $BB more exposure, it will fly off to space and beyond. Look at how $GME was literally raised from the dead. WSB ass blasted it from 6$ to 16$ before earnings. It's the butterfly effect and it started here on WSB!",faisall1,wallstreetbets,195.0

202,2020-12-12,"Honestly, I do come here to check up on the general pulse of the meme community. In some cases there is def some legitimate upside long term, not enough for me to build a large position in my main book, but possibly a flier or two. Airbnb can be a category changer, but 100b is rich and will need to catch up with its valuation. I see nonstop talk about pltr and gme, personally I think pltr can be a long term hold but not a top 10 position given it‚Äôs risk profile and lofty valuation. Gme can literally be a 10 bagger or a zero, sort of nothing in between as it can get short squeezed or acquired, but if left to its own devices will simply bleed into irrelevance. I don‚Äôt touch spacs or weed/ev, but there will be one or two winners long term (good luck finding them tho, it looks like nio may be the front runner for most relevant ev name not called tsla) the ancellary battery etc companies are all garbage",dms2367,wallstreetbets,202.0
