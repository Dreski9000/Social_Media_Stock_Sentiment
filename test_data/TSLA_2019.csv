0,2019-01-02,"So, from my huge losses last year, I can give you this advice which is very important. Cut your losses early after a set % is hit. Averaging down a losing trade is a strategy with very small win rate. 

And be cautious when buying longer expiry options because you are paying higher premium for Theta, yet your Delta doesn't change much. And in this volatility we have, a stock can viciously go against your bet and your option will be worthless even with longer dated expiry. Example TSLA which was at 380 two weeks ago and at 310 last week! So buying longer dated options is usually good in lower volatility market but this market is not for swing trading if you want to have consistent profits. 

So to make it short, do not average down out losing positions, cut losses early and take gains early. You can always re-enter the trade the next day or even same day if you have additional $$$.",uninfinity,wallstreetbets,0.0

24,2019-01-02,"absolutely wrong.  Square dropped from 90ish down to here because of the tightening of the credit market, which eats their fees, plus their CFO leaving to go to Nextdoor.  Their competition is pretty fierce, with paypal right there with them.  Square guided down last earnings for good reason, and while they might surprise on earnings (end of February) the underyling credit markets are tightening.  Square also has an elevated PE even at this price, with a reasonable price being around mid 40s.  However, in a bear market everything slowly moves down, and I can see Square going down to low 40s, or possibly mid to high 30s by the middle of this year, where I plan to load up leaps and make big money on Square again.  

&amp;#x200B;

Tesla is a very different proposition - their PE is insane, and values them at more than GM.  Their production problems and pricing problems are not going away, but it doesn't matter - they turned cash positive in Q3 and can most likely do so again, even with the increased pricing due to losing the EV credit.  Tesla is doing more than cars though - it's the entire infrastructure of electronic vehicles, and that's got tremendous upside.  So you can, in many ways, justify their staggering PE, as long as you assume they will be perfect in their execution.  Today we saw that this is not necessarily the case, and so TSLA took a hit, and frankly should be hit more than that.  

&amp;#x200B;

Wrong, fuck us, it shot up to 180 and sat for weeks...then, fuck us again, 210 for a few months.

1,2019-01-10,"I do this type of trade multiple times a year and I probably won‚Äôt explain this as well as I want to. The biggest problem is you‚Äôre locking yourself into TSLA for a year. TSLA is really volatile which is why you see the great premiums on the options. Let‚Äôs say your wrong about TESLA and the first quarter earnings dissapoint. Now Tesla is at 280 and you‚Äôre down 25K on your stock position. No problem, because you have 70K in option premium, right? Wrong. The options probably only drop in value by 30K because there‚Äôs so much implied volatility and time left. So your current position is up 5k - not great.

The best part is now it‚Äôs early february and you‚Äôre stuck. Now you‚Äôre thinking, we‚Äôll, I‚Äôm still up 55K if I wait until expiration... 10 months from now. But then Elon puts out a sex tape and it drops to 250 before April. Now your position is currently in the red. Again you tell yourself to wait til expiration because it can‚Äôt get worse that this and you‚Äôre still green if you wait til expiration. But then Trump ignores China next December and Elon halts production plans there. Stock drops to $195 and you‚Äôre stuck with 2 day old McNuggets for Christmas.

On January 13th, 2020, Chip Kelly and UCLA win the National Championship and he thanks Elon in the press conference for putting out a product that will help the world.

What in tarnation are you talking about. 


&gt;Tesla can't even produce the electric bits in the cars, Panasonic do all that for them

1/4 truth. The cells are created in conjunction with Panasonic at the Gigafactory, which is a joint mfg effort. This also gives TSLA first rights for all batteries, of which supply is short of demand. A temporary moat, which is why VW had to lock up billions in battery futures years ago lolllll.

Another broad-stroke half-truth about open IP and what that means for competitors. Do you know what parts of the EV are open and what are not?

OK dad, thanks for the chat. 

&gt; Considering Tesla has a higher market cap than Ford or VW yet doesn't even produce 1% of the cars the criticism is warranted.

Let's be honest, 99% of any growth investor laughs at anyone when they say this. The growth situations facing these companies, the dividends, the unions, the automation, the margin potential, the market potential, the current market monopoly, and the politics of incumbent mfgs vs. tsla means they really can't be compared.

TSLA has a perfect exponential growth curve and that's what a tech /growth investor looks for (among many things). I highly recommend you go all-in VW and Ford,  I'll do my TSLA thing, and at the end of 5Y, we'll meet up and winner buys the Kobe steaks. ",ValueInvestingIsDead,wallstreetbets,16.0

MAGAs will soon fight for cloud dominance. So, whichever gets MU first will get DRAM, NAND and XPoint at cost, which would be a huge advantage if/when memory cycles back. For MAG, this would also cut costs for their devices (and mitigate the issue of Samsung messing with inventories and jacking prices around on them). Imo, AAPL's and GOOG's ERs just showed what happens when phones are &gt;$1k vs &lt;$1k. (Full disclosure: I have many nearly worthless MU puts ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø).     
     
Another way to ensure cloud dominance is to snatch up big data players and keep or put them on your cloud.       
      
Also, making it easy for people to build sites on your infrastructure will be key. Even most devs have a hard time understanding MAG's different cloud products.

GOOG could also tie their ads and marketing tools into the web builder.             
     
I think AMZN will continue to acquire retail. AMZN Go is working pretty well, but they need more locations than just Whole Foods, which was a clear indicator of their intentions to go after WMT. The new e-commerce tax laws also encourage investments in brick and mortar -- even if only to act as product staging and warehousing facilities.

15,2019-02-04,"First of all, this is pure TA, I have literally no clue about TESLA fundamentals except that Musk is some rich american oligarch. I hope that if I am smart enough to make an accurate technical analysis for TESLA you people will understand it's merits and the fact that it actually works most of the time. I also apologize for usage of raw translation of some Russian market terms (if they are actually Russian, I honestly dunno), I hope you will understand me.

According to what I managed to read from my TA TSLA shares are currently in a volatile flat trend, they neither really bullish nor bearish, the move in a stable flat channel of 244-390 which is an evidence of TSLA shares being highly speculative and probably overbought due to lack of any real growth beyond the top border of the channel after fake correction drops.

The most crucial part is the fact of a triangle forming that will squeeze the local flat channel inside the global flat channel, that will be broken by a major movement in Spring-early Summer either bullish or bearish due to long consolidation supplying enough fuel to make the TSLA shares highly susceptible to market manipulations and flat fatigue.

I suggest not buying or selling TSLA until the price breaks any border and when it does, just go with the flow and buy/sell according to the new trend.",Margeen_Cole,wallstreetbets,15.0

29,2019-02-04,"There can be several, several answers and discussions to this question. 

One answer is look at IV percentile and you can sell CC‚Äôs based on that strictly, as normally high IV = high premium. Normally that‚Äôs a short time frame, but it is also dependent on breaking news, other factors, etc 

Another way is simply look at technical analysis if you‚Äôre familiar enough with it, and you can play off of that on extremely long time frames with high premium you will usually get - of course, that can be risqu√© depending on news and fluctuation - but normally 52 week highs and lows take quite a bit to be broken, unless they‚Äôre close to breaking one already. 

Another one is fundamental analysis, and that should be pretty self explanatory. 

Besides CC‚Äôs, there‚Äôs also other option strats (spreads, straddles, strangles, ‚Äòjellyfish‚Äô) that can be used to gain premium, limit risk, etc. I don‚Äôt particularly know the depth of your knowledge regarding options or the market in general, but I assume it‚Äôs probably new to a degree because you‚Äôre asking this very generalized question.

14,2019-02-05,"Let me preface that I do not have a position in TSLA and do not advocate shorting it. However, if I had to present a short thesis it would be not that TSLA will fail  Enron style, rather, that TSLA will remain a luxury automotive company. As such, its valuation metrics should be commensurate to existing luxury automative companies.  

Here is a very shitty on the spot pricing comparison. Let's look at BMW ... market cap of $47.8B on $112B revenue/2.7M cars (they also have better margin, but let's say TSLA will get their margin in the future). TSLA.. market cap of $55.03B , Q4 results 90k cars, 6.3B revenue, %134 YoY growth... so let's combine this and apply YoY to next year linearly... we can expect 420k cars and $30b revenue. So TSLA will produce 6.7x less cars and 4x less revenue. We also need to consider that DAX has PE ~ 12, while S&amp;P is ~20, so let's say US stock are just 67% more expensive.... so pricing based on forward revenue and using the US company premium we would get 47.8/4*1.67~20B. Which means that tsla has an additional 175% premium based on... future dominance of the market. 

The short thesis can then be not that TSLA will go bankrupt, rather that the ""future dominance"" premium should be lower. Let's say the premium should be 100%... then TSLA price target would be... $233.

11,2019-03-02,"Haha, that's my exact plan. I figure OTM long-dated calls will be worth it to harvest the most delta. 

Safer, ITM long-dated calls (i.e. top of the range at a $360 strike) is *safer*, but of course will yield less profit if TSLA does make a significant move. 

I didn't think of an exit price until you mentioned it, so I'll do some math:

Last breakout saw a rise of ~20% from the previous top (i.e. from $280 to $342 in two months. Taking that same value (obviously it won't be the *exact* same amount of % breakout, but it will give a nice estimate to exit the position), we add 20% to the current top of $380. That comes out to $456 share price.

With that being said, profits at ~$430 would be a solid/safe exit. Of course, I also haven't looked at the option pricing yet, nor have I looked at the breakeven for the long-dated OTM calls.

Once I see an entry, I'll probably make a DD post with all of the math and solid entry/exit points.

Posted this over December-January(ish). Haven't changed the chart. This is one pattern that I would LOVE to see play out. TSLA weekly chart. Assuming TSLA trades sideways in this range, RSI will keep decreasing and MACD will reset. Late 2019/Early 2020 calls could potentially capture a nice breakout for TSLA into new highs. Plenty of support has been tested, but also major resistance (i.e. this range).

25,2019-03-01,"Honestly not sure. I just updated my model, and they really seem to be killing it. 11,348 deliveries in 2018, and I'm estimating ARPU for the ES8 to be around $64,000 (estimating about 3/4 of a billion for 2018 revenues). 

The annualized deliveries for the ES8 was just under 40,000 as of Dec 2018, and on Dec 15 they started taking deposits for the ES6, so will be very interesting to see if the release any information about the kind of numbers they're working with. 


Given the target market for the ES6, I would guess they'll at least do 1.5x the number of deliveries of the ES8, if not 2x. So making some BIG assumptions, let's say the ES6 has an ARPU of $55,000, and they do 1.5x the annualized deliveries of the ES8 (60,000). Let's also assume ES8 deliveries stay around the same rate as they are now (40,000, though this number is likely to increase far more). 

They'll deliver 100,000 vehicles in 2019, for a revenue of just under $5.9 billion (what is that like 6x revenue growth?). This is also right in line with the estimates from JAC and NIO regarding their annual output. Remember, Tesla is only projecting they'll do 500k across their product line _this year_ as well. Tsla marketcap is 50bln, NIO marketcap is 10bln.

So all that being said, if earnings go well I could see 20-30% upside from where we're at now ($12-$13). The IPO lockup is a bit of a dark horse, but just because people _can_ sell doesn't mean they _will_. Given the huge number of people that have yet to buy a car in China, NIO has a huge base of people to sell to and could easily outpace Tesla as early as 2020 in terms of deliveries and production. The best part is that NIO's production is managed by JAC, who have a hell of a lot of experience building cars. They will not go through this ""production hell"" that Tesla has experienced because the facilities already exist, and already work.",450LbsGorilla,wallstreetbets,25.0

Those institutional investors either 1) directly invest in non-profitable startups like Uber/Lyft (or nonprofitable seasoned companies like NFLX/TSLA's debt), or 2) invest in nonprofitable startups by proxy (eg giving money to VCs and PEs) and those VCs/PEs invest in new companies.

So...you have nothing then.

&gt;All their manufacturing was tied up with S/X/3 with 3 using all hands on deck.  Let's just say your demand thesis has some legs.  At a similar build and parts list (75% per Elon) to the 3 and with design all complete and signed off, why wouldn't Tesla just start producing and delivering model Y now if their model 3 orders dried up?  Do you think demand for new Tesla products in general will just disappear?  

Because they're not done developing the car yet? What makes you think they're actually ready for production other than Elon's say so?

 You realize there is a huge margin between ""Tesla can sell every single car they produce with good profit"" and ""literally nobody will ever buy a Tesla ever again"" right?

&gt;Who led consumer reports in customer satisfaction again?

The Chevy Volt was #1 for a year and #2 for several years, and look at how that turned out.

&gt; And seriously. I think I'll believe those speculative articles over some TSLA.Q cult member individually counting cars. That is just somethin else. Better yet, I'll actually wait for the Q1 numbers because, you know, TSLA long means more than 1 or 2 quarters out.

So you prefer speculation with no basis over actual due diligence, got it. And they don't have to individually count the cars, you can simply count the ships. 

Or how about the project by Tesla fans over in europe to count the total number of orders? As of last count they were still shy of 20k orders(not pre-orders) in all of europe.

&gt;When you say nowhere near production, I think you actually mean no where near production capacity. If demand completely dried up and you have a bunch of manufacturing capability just idle, you start making products that sell. And Model Y, believe it or not, is going to sell. A lot.

Or the Model Y is nowhere near ready for production yet. Or demand for Model Y surges for a couple of quarters and then dries up just like it did for the Model 3.",Fausterion18,wallstreetbets,22.0

&gt;My source for the overseas sales numbers is based on drone monitoring of the single shipping terminal Tesla uses to ship cars to both EU and China. People literally counted the number of cars.

The spark job which is counting occurrences of specific words  needs to also check the user and put a hard limit on how many times the same user‚Äôs score gets added to the sum. This should be easy since the dataset which I scraped from Reddit is in a JSON format with author, body, etc with everything I need.

2. I‚Äôm still developing the part for individual stocks. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm doing 10 at a time and will eventually stop at RH too 100. Unfortunately it‚Äôs a manual task. I just need to add stock symbols and their synonyms. For example, a synonym for TSLA would be Elon if the remaining content of the body contains key words which are used for sentiment.

I'm a newbie at this like you with the exception that I have a few more months under my belt. It takes years of discipline to master this game and I'm ok with it.

I'm pretty sure tomorrow will be crap. If you looks at futures, Asia is in free fall and US ain't doing great at the moment (short term).

Right now, I have big money in GLUU and small money in TSLA. Please look at GLUU chart. It's been steadily rising. 

GLUU is over 100% for the year. Plenty of analysts are bullish on it. Global gaming revenue is going up, especially mobile. Do you play any mobile games or knows someone who play them? These games charge micro-transactions. I'm going to be in it till around end of Apr or so. That's its ER date. I'm going to get out prior to ER.

Take a look at TSLA chart. That thing don't stay below $300 for long period of time. Elon Musk has a tendency to hype things up. I'm also in it for around end of Apr for ER as well.

If you are interested in the wheel strategy, take a look at TSLA's premium. A huge caution - when I buy something, it goes down. When I sell something, it immediately goes up. So maybe you might want to inverse me lol

6,2019-03-08,"Lol nice! I'm really lazy when it comes to reading about compliance / margin reqs, so I don't know the levels. I think it's safe to say that you'd need more than level 0, so you'd have to request access with your broker. This generally involves having a decent account size and saying you ""a lot of experience"" trading stocks and options - whether that's verifiable or not has never been an issue, in my exp.

Google ""highest implied volatility options"" and you'll find some resources. In general, stocks that make big percentage moves daily (weed stocks, TSLA, etc.) will have juicier premiums. Premiums also get very high for expiration the week of earnings, but this is definitely not for beginners. I've never sold more than a week out. Mostly only several days out.

If you manage to get the correct options level access. I think it's very reasonable to sell 1 or 2 contracts of something just to get a feel for how everything works. Do this with a low to mid stock price (not AMZN lol).

42,2019-03-08,"01:40 PM EST, 03/08/2019 (MT Newswires) -- Canaccord Genuity has reaffirmed its buy rating on Tesla (TSLA) with a price target of $450, after the electric car maker introduced this week V3 Supercharging, which will enable its electric vehicle to charge faster than any other electric vehicle currently on the market. The new system has 250kW peak power versus the prior 120kW level.

""We view the V3 as further confirmation of our thesis that high speed charging, and thus SiC components, will help inflect EV growth rates higher as range anxiety fades for consumers,"" Canaccord said in a note.

11,2019-03-09,"So I ran over the [Dark Pool buying](https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix?) + [Smart Money Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_money_index) thing I posted [about earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ayv9hm/weekend_discussion_thread_march_810_2019/ei3jky9/). Here's an update with Friday's information. 

My process is this: I look over the list Squeeze Metrics puts out for subscribers that lists unusual dark pool buying or selling activity. If I see a name pop up a couple of times, I cross reference it with the Smart Money Index to see if the broader market confirms. 

I also sometimes check out particular names I'm interested in that don't necessarily pop up on that ""unusual acitvity"" list. SAP was one such catch. Next time I'm going to try and keep my personal/subjective picks on a separate list. 

**Lots of Dark Pool Buying + SMI trending or reversing upwards:**

1. ABB 
2. AMZN
3. BCS
4. C
5. **DWDP** (was on my previous list)
6. IVZ
7. JNUG
8. **MO** (was on my previous list)
8. MOMO (earnings this week)
9. NEM
10. **SAP** (was on my previous list)
10. SOGO
11. SRPT
12. WFC
13. **XOM** (was on my previous list)

Changes from previous list:

- Dark pool buying volume or proportion of buying for FOXA, ITUB, LLY, NKTR, NTNX, ORCL, and TSM dropped off considerably Friday. 

- RIO had an increase in dark pool selling Friday, but Thursday was also its ex-dividend date, so that may have played a role. 

**Lots of Dark Pool Selling + SMI trending or reversing downwards:**

1. BGS
2. DFEN
3. DUST
4. INGN
5. PRS
6. PRA

Notes on this list:

- CQQQ and KWEB have appeared on the ""unusual selling"" list but SMI isn't showing a confirmation. Similarly, INDL (the 3x leveraged India Bull ETF), EWW (Mexico ETF) have all had unusual selling this week, and YINN (3x China bull ETF) and EEM (Emerging Markets ETF) popped up yesterday but again the SMI isn't clear.  

- TSLA likewise has seen heavy dark pool selling these past few days but isn't being confirmed by the SMI. It's notable that before Musk's big announcement about the cheaper model 3, they were however doing lots of buying.

- IAU (gold ETF) has been on the unusual selling list a lot, but SMI isn't confirming and it seems odd that there'd be buying of gold miners and selling of miner bear ETFs at the same time. 

**Broad Sector/Index Notes:**

1. SPY: Increased dark pool buying each of the last three days
2. QQQ: Increased

Other notes:

- Last week/early this week saw lots of selling of small caps and biotech. Friday though saw heavy buying of TNA, the 3x small cap bull etf. IWM and XBI also seem to be trending upwards in regards to proportion (but not aggregate volume) of buying:selling.

- Thursday saw lots of buying in FB and selling of SQQQ. Friday reversed that, with FB seeing lots of dark pool selling and QQQ and TQQQ getting sold. 

- FANG names are mixed. AMZN, BABA, NFLX seem strong. BIDU, FB, NVDA, TSLA, and TWTR seem weak. AAPL and GOOG flat/holding steady. ",FireSail,wallstreetbets,11.0

-80% of a market that sold $2M cars when Ford and GM alone (not to mention the numerous others) sold over $15M isn't enough to justify a market cap of $60B which is double that of ford or GM. 

-""better"" is wholely subjective. Especially when referring to $70k luxury electric car. 

There's no valuation of this company that doesn't include BIG pipe dreams about TSLA taking over the world. Also, ask yourself this: what would happen to the stock price if Elon left?

so given the fees, I cant really toss it in high-yield online savings to make money.

what I can do tho, is find some ""safe"" 4-6% dividend aristocrat stock - sell puts/covered calls on 'em for extra income to boost potential profit.

For example, I'm short $TSLA 18 APR 235p at 1.06. $TSLA shit 9% after I opened the trade due to the missed delivery number but my floor is so low and the stock rebounded a bit so that I can buy it back at 0.65 right now so I'm still profitable.

vs. 

&gt; affordable autonomous taxi for the masses whos monthly outlay to get you everywhere would probably have an equivalent vs. current gas+maintenance+monthlypayments for vehicle ownership.

Reminder, I'm not even talking about TSLA. I'm talking about companies who can afford to economically scale to manage tens of thousands of taxis and provide the lowest-cost service to majority population of large cities. If you don't think this introduction will have an impact on the underlying economics of vehicle ownerdship, as well as the secondary &amp; tertiary markets the industry has created...What can we agree on? ...Do you like Italian food? 

I think these two markets will be very different in calculating 'asset' depreciation, esp in the context of Waymo (and not self-ownership e.g. Tesla):

1) Depreciation Rates of A leased 2009 Combustion Engine Honda Civic sitting in S. Jones' driveway putting 5000mi / year on it. 

2) Depreciation Rates of : Autonomous Electric Vehicle which Generates a Revenue and has far less moving parts than a gasoline incumbent.

If you disagree, that's OK. I wouldn't call your ""bullshit"" claim the pinnacle of critical thinking like you're presenting it as, tho. You're legit extrapolating todays economy &amp; market (used consumer-owned depreciating borrowed asset) to an entirely new economy (revenue-generating massively-owned autonomous taxis) and then celebrating yourself as a ""critical thinker"" lol.

22,2019-04-11,"For cheap stocks like $GME or $BBBY maybe five contacts. I only do cash-secured so for something like $TSLA, $QQQ, or $NFLX just one.",Networking4Eyes,wallstreetbets,22.0
23,2019-04-11,"Sure thing!

My main earnings strategy is to sell far out of the money puts the day before the earnings release. The expiry I pick is the closest one to the day after earnings which will have the highest implied volatility. Implied volatility (IV) is very high right before an earnings release because the non-inside traders don't know if the stock will go up or down. It's a gamble. Some stocks are more volatile than others. Companies like $AMD or $TSLA are going to move huge while other companies like $JPM (tomorrow morning) may not move so much. The higher the IV the more money there is to be made. 

&amp;#x200B;

After the earnings release the IV drops an outstanding amount because everyone knows what has happened. This is what is referred to as ""IV crush"". For example, $BBBY had an IV of 129% before close 4/10/19 and dropped to \~50-70% on open today. You will recall from your Black-Scholes options mathematics that Vega is the relation of an options contract price to IV. Price goes up, IV goes up, price goes down, IV goes down. Basically, you can guarantee that every earnings release on every company will experience enormous IV crush. If you buy the calls or puts you're screwed by this no matter what direction you pick. If you sell a call or put you can capitalize on this IV crush by selling the contact when the premium is grossly inflated and buying it back cheap after the crush.

&amp;#x200B;

So why ""far OTM strikes""? This strategy is not foolproof. If you sell an ATM put and the stock shits (like $BBBY did today) the change in Delta (the relation of the underlying to the options contract price \[e.g. stock goes down, call price goes down, put price goes up; stock goes up, call price goes up, put price goes down\]) may cause you to lose money if the change in Delta is larger than the decrease in Vega. Remember that when you sell a put the worst case scenario is that your contact expires in the money and you are assigned and will own 100 shares per option contact on whatever stock you picked at the strike price you picked (although the stock price may drop much lower than whatever strike price you picked so you will own shares that are worth much less). If your contact expires out of the money you get to keep the premium you collected in full. The name of the game is to pick a strike that will not expire in the money. So look at how the stock moves during past earnings. $BBBY moves like 15-20%, so you need to pick a strike that can tolerate that movement and not be in the money. $LULU moves like 20% on earnings. If your strike is low enough you don't need to be too worried if the stock shits the bed 20%. 

&amp;#x200B;

When you sell puts the profit is capped so this is not yacht-making money. The return for the lower profits though is a higher probability of success which if you execute this strategy over and over again you will start to accumulate some nice wins and you can start to laugh at the people who buy calls and puts the day before earnings and lose their ass on the I V  C R U S H and that they picked the wrong direction. 

&amp;#x200B;

Below are some real trades I have made illustrating what I have described:

&amp;#x200B;

3/20/19: $MU sold to open 22 MAR 40p at 1.35 at 109% IV.

3/21/19: $MU bought to close 22 MAR 40p at 0.29 at 60% IV (1.06 profit). 

3/27/19: $LULU sold to open 29 MAR 130p at 1.62 at 135 IV.

3/28/19: $LULU bought to close 29 MAR 130p at 0.02 at 80% IV (1.60 profit).

4/2/19: $GME sold to open 12 APR 8.5p at 0.16 at 113% IV.

4/3/19: $GME bought to close 12 APR 8.5p at 0.13 at 65% IV. ($GME shit the bed. This one came close to not being profitable but it worked out for a tiny 0.03 profit).

4/10/19: $BBBY sold to open 18 APR 15p at 0.14 at 129% IV.

4/11/19: $BBBY bought to close 18 APR 15p at 0.04 at 70% IV. ($BBBY shit the bed too but the IV crush was massive too. Doesn't matter, 0.10 profit).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm all cash at the moment (aside from a small position in $REML) in preparation for $NFLX earnings on Tuesday. The 18 APR contacts are already around 69% IV and they usually trade around 35% (forecasting a 34% I V  C R U S H already!). You could sell the 18 APR 312.5p at 1.00 and tolerate a 15% drop in the stock after earnings. Not a bad buffer. After that we have $TWTR, $FB, $TSLA, $AMD, and $AAPL.

You're really quiet and modest about your abilities and gains considering how well you're doing. It's amazing to see how so many of us from different background all approach it by dissecting each components of the stock/company/business life and make a strong analytical guess on how it'll perform.

&gt; what‚Äôs going on in specific sectors.

Would it be annoying for me to ask which specific sectors? I think a lot of people here look at debt to asset ratio in comparison to the product/service but I tend to also add their target demographic and how aggressive they market. 

Can I ask for blue chips companies how far out you buy your options for? I was thinking of buying LEAPS for companies like Coca Cola who have a very strong history of slow upward trend. Brands that's been out for awhile and have placed themselves into other business franchises seems like a good bet for it. 

Thank you for all the tips! Gave me more to think about in researching past performances and made me a better trader just by soaking up your knowledge. :) The only pattern I saw with stocks were TSLA where I always see it dip to rise back again in short amount of time, consistently.

6,2019-05-09,"Damn, sorry for your loss. I've sold naked puts on a stock that's moved 20% but never more than that.

Selling naked puts on a volitile stock around earnings isn't necessarily a bad idea, but you need to manage your risk properly. You normally want to sell OTM at least 2 times the expected move, and at least a month out. So in this case, if you sold the 45 puts in June, you would be still be sitting on a large paper loss, but the risk of assignment would be much lower.

Only problem is you wouldn't have been able to sell the June 45 puts anyways, since there were no bids and no open interest. Which leads me to my other word of advice; make sure there is plenty of liquidity on the options you're selling.

Don't let this stop you from selling options. I had a large drawdown on some SPX options I sold earlier this year. I took the L and moved on, but I've already made back a good chunk of that loss selling spreads on high IV stocks like TSLA and AMZN.",wafflerdeluxe,wallstreetbets,6.0

* If you can't write down on a piece of paper why you think the option contract that you're buying is going to be successful, then don't buy it.
* Don't play weekly options. If you're down a lot, weekly options are a great way to go lower. I'm literally contradicting this right now but just wait 24 hours and i'll post my loss
* In general, stick with areas where you have the most knowledge, even if that is close to none. I'm not saying only trade options on 2 stocks, but don't go charging out of your comfort zone just cause some dumbass like me is screaming to buy long $TSLA calls
* Learn about the option greeks. I probably don't do as much math as I should, but even if you plan on doing none, you should at least understand what they mean and how they're affecting what you're getting your self into.
* ""The stock market is a tool for transferring money from the impatient to the patient."" - Buffet or Munger, i forget
* **Seriously.** Patience. I am up 20% on $Dis **SHARES,** which I bought right before I discovered options. Do you know how badly I wanted to fomo into Dis calls afterwards? I ended up just buying one (weekly cause I was even more retarded than I am now), and it tanked. Yes I lost money, but I didn't lost 10x what I could've.
* Don't confuse luck with being good. When i first started experimenting with options, I played $RAD lack a fiddle. RAD $0.5P 4/18 BUY $30 -&gt; RAD $0.5P 4/18 SELL $50, **same day**. I would cream my pants at this today. Chasing it constantly will most likely end up with RH at $0 though.
* Despite what I just said, you can't make gains unless you commit money. It sucks to lose money. It sucks more to win a small amount of money on something you thought was a sure thing and you committed $195 like the true yellow-bellied coward you are.

Find a company that has good potential or want fall off the face of the Earth (such as MSFT). Then, learn TA. Despite all of wsb shitting on it, if you do it with a company that has good fundamentals and do it for a short time, it can work.

I do this on MU, NOC, MSFT, V, PYPL and TSLA Its worked for me. The s&amp;p 500 is up 6% in the past six months. Using this (and admittedly options with TA), I've gotten 30% return so far.

5/13

* Financial Regulations: XLF 5/17 ATM or very slightly OTM puts
* 5G Hearings: XLNX, QCOM, CCI, LRCX, AMAX 5/17 OTM calls and probably even 1-3 month out OTM calls at least 4 strikes above market.^*(5G)

5/14

* Boeing hearing on 737 MAX: BA 5/17 slightly to moderate OTM puts
* Renewable Energy: 5/17 calls on literally any renewable energy companies, maybe even companies that utilize that tech, such as TSLA
* FCC Hearing With Potential Net Neutrality Conversation: Comcast, AT&amp;T 5/17 moderate OTM puts

5/15

* Drug Price Reduction Hearings: GILD 5/24 strangle if you believe GILD will be able to get in front of the criticism somewhat which will cause unpredictable results, 5/17 ATM or slightly OTM puts if you think it'll go badly
* Carbon Capture Hearings: OXY and NRG 5/17 calls

None of these are explicitly day trade positions. If you're feeling lucky, make your play a day or two earlier than the dates I've specified. However, doing so carries significant risk, especially since the market is acting irrationally with extreme volatility due to trade talks. Making plays on these specified days won't be tendie-reaping, but will minimize volatility risk.

\*5G: Honestly, it might be a REALLY good idea to get into long dated (around September) calls now on these 5G companies to try and make an earnings report play early. Their profit might be down (with the exception of maybe QCOM), but their guidance might be so incredibly strong that it causes a massive bump. If I had the finances available, I'd wait about a week or two for trade talk volatility to subside, gauge whether or not normal market conditions have resumed, and get into long dated calls at least 4-6 strikes above market at the first market dip I find.",Solodolio,wallstreetbets,2.0

9,2019-06-01,"Buying $SPY or $QQQ and selling covered calls two or three strikes out of the money is a boring but logical solution for you.

You can, as many others have said, look for stocks with higher implied volatility to increase the yield. Think of companies like $BYND or $TSLA. Just note that the higher IV does mean that your long shares could get fucked eventually. However, the option premiums are basically free money as long as the price doesn't go tits up.

Another alternative, which deviates from covered calls but is essentially the same thing, is to sell cash-secured puts. Use the cash in the account as collateral and sell out of the money puts on stocks you wouldn't mind owning, $SPY, $QQQ, $TSLA. If the stocks go up, you keep your full premium without actually owning any shares. If the stocks drop you are assigned shares and can then sell covered calls against them so you kind of get to play both sides. This is my primary tendie-generating strategy.

But this was even before I started looking at the stock and even before test driving me (I went nuts how good the car is).""


This paragraph inspired me to buy 40k shares TSLA. Thanks, TC!",ErichPryde,wallstreetbets,19.0
20,2019-06-01,"I could see it rising a bit. I don't see a large drop unless their financials are garbage and they go under. All you really have to do is check out market cap of other car companies. I didn't do extensive check, but most hover around 30b-40b, and largest I saw was Toyota at like 170b. Tesla is at 32b. Best you can hope for is toyota-like or more, 6x current price. But it's likely going to be about max 25% higher than current price to be in line with most car companies, or unchanged. 

I think current market cap says something about where fair price is though. It's at low end of established car companies. TSLA isn't established yet so price is still a bit high. But things are priced on where they will be, so in that respect there's still a little room to run and shouldn't be much more downside. 

Basically, if you believe Tesla won't go bankrupt and disappear then it's a good time to buy, it shouldn't drop much more, but don't expect it to get much more than 40b market cap, which is about a $46 increase from current price. There's always the chance that hype increases price by more falsely (like what happened already), but to actually legit increase, and safely increase, they need positive earnings over a long period. It's getting to the point that they need to actually show something instead of imaginary hopes. So don't expect that $46 increase until their earnings give reason for it.",Zer033x,wallstreetbets,20.0
21,2019-06-01,"This post violates the very first rule of WSB.  It's a sleazy ad for Ritholtz Wealth Management and/or Nick Maggiuli's newsletter.

While banishment seems like the most sensible punishment, it's not very WSB.  Therefore, I propose that Ritholtz Wealth Management become the official Wealth Management firm of WSB.  This is surely a win-win.  Ritholtz clearly approves of the give-no-fucks lifestyle that WSB embraces, and their potential clients need to know that.

Whats more complicated a full EV car or a Hybrid car? Just listen to the last Ford ER. They already talked about electric mustangs. Why are they confident about this switch? well because they've been making hybrids for quite some time now. I can think of at least 5 car companies today that make hybrids well. Their entire engineering staff have gone through at least 2 product cycles of hybrids. TSLA has the lead, but they need to fix their FCF asap. There are no signs that the competitors are dieing, infact the opposite. So they better start making some money soon before some big dick RnD is spent by the big automakers. if TSLA spends 1.4b a year on RnD.

25,2019-06-01,"I agree. I think in the past era (think pre 2000) it was difficult to measure a startup companies value. But high tech has had about 2 decades to mature and I believe now, the analysts are quite good at reading future growth prospects. Take a look at how Cloud companies are valued vs traditional software. Saas companies vs those that arent.

Fundamentals always play a role. When Amazon was not making a profit, there was measurable fundamentals of gain. They increased marketshare, they caused other companies to close. The capex was huge and was delivering productivity gains. 

The question i have for TSLA is what are those measureable goals? One was production numbers. The other was the progress of self driving cars. You can't just keep raising capital through equity markets without some proof of progress. The bond holders wont stand for no progress. Self driving is capital intensive to deliver on, and that is the very thing that TSLA does not have the luxury of having. They need to make more cars right now and sell them in order to sustain capex in autonomous cars/electrical power grid.

They'll rip off the best tech, subsidize production, subsidize the purchasing of their products, undercut competition by selling below costs, and flooding the market to ensure costs stay too low for competitors to start up. They could also cut off REMs to TSLAs US-based plants to cut that production.

Dont get so caught up on dividend yields. This is a long haul, conservative game. What's the upside if you play your cards exactly right and nail the high yield portfolio?  You manage to attain a 8-13% for one year? You could get that with an index fund almost* risk free.

**General:**

FDs: Faggots Delights. Generally refers to short term, extremely OTM options that have a very low chance of ever going ITM. Basically only bought by poor autists who like gambling (most of this sub), loses money 90% percent of the time except for that one guy who gets 300% return and encourages more retards to buy in.

DD: Due Diligence. Basically research/investment thesis for a stock play. DO NOT LISTEN TO DDs on WSB. 99% you'd be better off inversing. Note: SoRefreshing and a few others who actually know what they're doing might be an exception, although blindly copying others is also a good way to lose money.

**Stocks**

ATH: All time high. If you want to buy puts at this point, you're retarded. If you want to buy calls at this point, you're probably also retarded.

Leverage: Use small money to make big money. Except it generally fails because only poor and stupid people do it.

Margin: Borrowing money. See above.

Bid/Ask: How much you're willing to pay vs how much people are willing to sell for. Limit orders set a limit for bid/ask while market orders basically leave everything up to robinhood. Don't be that guy who places a market order and complains when it isn't filled optimally. You'll look retarded.

**Options**

Call/Put: The right to buy/sell 100 shares of a certain stock at a certain price

Strike Price: The price mentioned above. The further away it is from being ITM, the less the option is worth.

ITM/ATM/OTM: In the money, at the money, and out of the money. If exercising your option would instantly net you some cash, it's In The Money and you're either insanely lucky or rich as hell. If it literally wouldn't do shit because the strike price is the same as the stock price, it's At The Money. If exercising it would make you one of the most retarded people on earth because you're literally gifting away cash, it's Out of The Money.

Expiration Date: Your time limit. The closer it is, the less the option is worth.

Exercise: Exercising the right mentioned above. You probably aren't going to exercise shit because you're poor, so you don't need to worry about this. Just sell your options. If one of your options are exercised against you however, you're probably kinda fucked.

Shorting an option: Selling an option to another person. Generally a bad idea if you don't know what you're doing cause you can lose more than you have; 1r0nyman is a good example. However if you do know what you're doing, it's a more consistent way to make money because shorting theta tends to work well given that it inherently inverses all the autistic plays made on this sub.


IV: Implied Volatility. How much you expect the stock to move. Stocks with high IV have more expensive options. For example: who expects AAPL to drop a shit ton in the next week? Not too many people, it's not really likely unless China bitchslaps them back across the Pacific. TSLA, on the other hand, could randomly drop 30 points after Musk randomly tweets about Catgirls again and gets smacked by the SEC, so there's a decent chance you could make money with a put there. Because the stock is more volatile, options are worth more.

**Options Strategies**

Spreads: Lame-ass shit you only do because Robinhood forces you to. Limits risk and reward by buying/selling similar types of options, so not great if you want to gamble like everyone on this sub. If you gain money overall, you've got a short credit spread. If you spend money, you have a long debit spread. Credit spreads are good on stocks with high IV.

Straddles/Strangles: If you think a stock will move but don't know what direction because you're an indecisive retard who can't predict how the market will work and are too lazy to hedge in an intelligent manner, this is for you. Basically you buy both a call and a put so no matter what way it moves, you win. Except not really, because the market will trade sideways and fuck you over.

Iron Condor: Basically the opposite of the previous strategy where you short a call and put spread so that you get credit but get fucked if the market moves significantly up or down. It seems like a good consistent strategy until you realize you're either risking $100 to make $20, or you're selling options on a stock like TSLA which moves ridiculous amounts and is essentially impossible to predict.

In Conclusion: GTFO back to r/investing and put your money into an ETF. Sell covered calls if you're a pussy.",afieryfate,wallstreetbets,124.0

Despite plenty of famous rich artists all around the world he partnered with a Japanese one for his Dear Moon project. His love for anime never ceases to reach new heights, and it is clear that Elon favors the Asian auto manufacturing scene over 'Old Auto' in the US and Germany.* 

&amp;#x200B;

*Now, what is Elon getting at here? What can we glean from this? My thesis is that Elon is attempting to take North Korea private and his connections with Japan and China are just stepping stones to gathering influence and followers in Asia. They share many similarities what with the whole rockets thing, the 'anyone who disagrees with me is clearly evil' thing, and the 'we dont need lidar in our cars,  Tesla technology is Best Technology!' attitude. North Korea has an immensely large amount of Rare Earth Metals, which will make the chips for Tesla's HW4 chip once Elon and Kim are joint rulers of the region.

BYND a week later is at 88. I get worried, sell a 6/21 120c for $138 thinking, ""I'll at least make something back from that $571, and this thing is probably going to stay level at this point because of the matrix of small float vs not a multibillion dollar company.

Gets closer to earnings. I'm down a bit on the 110c, and  -$138 on the 120c. I have a serious meditation session trying to determine what the best course of action is. The small stupid part: I say, eh, if this thing tanks I'll get the full premium of the call I sold and I can wait a week to see what the 110c does over the next week. If it goes up, It can't go up that much, so hopefully it straddles 115-120 and I can figure it out based on what to do.

So Friday morning, I'm feeling good, but I want out of the 120c obviously. At $128, I buy to close the 120c for $1180, exercise the 110c. I'm feeling good because I am not on the hook for the $12k+ if I had been assigned with a crashing 110c. During these minutes, I'm looking at the value of the 110c and 120c on top of each other trying to figure out risk/benefit of assign/exercise or sell and gain benefits from the contracts themselves. Meanwhile the price is going all over the place from 135 down to 122 then up to 127.

Share price down to 122 10 minutes later. I'm now realizing my cost basis on my shares isn't just $115 (for the IRS it is), which in my mind it was because I wanted out of the 120c. 

The cost basis in reality is now $11500 + $1k ($1180-138 premium) plus the various TDA commissions. Then I realize, ""FUCK. $127ish)

I was at my son's graduation when the fucking thing hit $148, and my wife wasn't going to let me have my phone out looking at shares during a elementary school graduation.

My best case scenario was exercising 110c and being assigned on 120c. I would have made ~$270 total from that. My worst case was losses all around (-$400). Instead I did the rookie autist thing where I burned $1180 on that 120c buy back that I could have waited on, and shouldn't have sold in the first place.

As someone said in the thread with that doof who sold 10 110c on margin: Don't try to pick up a quarter in front of a juiced up steamroller running on retard strength.

I also screwed up and sold a 200c TSLA call when it hit 170's this week. Panicked (appropriately) when it hit $198 premarket a few days later and lost $400 on that plan. Lesson there is don't screw around with TSLA. Haupt91 labeled it ""that insane one"" in the Elmo video for a reason",soccergoon13,wallstreetbets,25.0

Ok kids. gather around papa! Time to preach

FOMC is next week. The market is trying to price in a rate cut as we speak based on the choppy action you have seen in the past 2 days.

It would be advisable to stop taking risks on mega caps, large caps and the index options as we navigate these choppy waters. Search for niche companies which do not follow the trend of the index. That might be BYND, TSLA, TLRY etc etc.. So you get the message, ya meme stocks basically. 

This FOMC is going to be a huge huge catalyst event. How to play it Papa???? Well Papa Ashes is going to have a \~40$ strangle FDS on AMZN before FOMC. 

1. Rate cut: Market will instantly spike up. Have a day trade available but do not hastily close the losing position. Let the market digest the news. Once direction is clear those amzns fds will be worth 5-10x their original price and you will recover cost of your strangle too.
2. Rate steady and they say we will think next fomc: Market will crash like nothing else and we likely will see 272-275 before we ever see 294 on SPY. Again AMZN fds will be 5-10x if not more if you hold them from Wednesday-Friday or even Thursday mid day.

&amp;#x200B;

Bonus freebie from Papa because WSB LOVES TA so much. 

The stock that I am most interested in aside from AMZN as a play beyond FOMC is Facebook (FB)

/u/yolosense : There is cup and handle formation on the weekly for FB.

[Facebook Weekly Chart with C&amp;H](https://imgur.com/rYQhocH)

Again how to play this, if rates are cut, there is huge huge upside to FB because of economic events + C&amp;H formation. Calls on this once event is completed. Massive upside with ATH target.

If rates are not cut, this formation will obviously break and the handle will be an avalanche fall back to base of the cup of even further. So puts on this.

Yes there might privacy issues and red taping for FB in the future, but as option traders our job is to get in and get out within 2-3days and this works best. Advice is to preserve capital till FOMC.

Your terminology is fine; the only thing I'd note is that SPY isn't a stock, but an ETF of the S&amp;P500. Betting on $SPY is essentially betting on the overall US stock market as opposed to betting on a specific stock (like $TSLA or $GE).

It's possible he was doing this as part of executing a spread of some kind, where you buy multiple different options contracts of potentially differing strike prices and/or expiries on the same underlying security because you're making a very specific bet (e.g. that the price of the security will be between A and B at or during certain times). 

However, regardless of exactly what he did/was doing to end up in this position, it's clear that he had no idea that this was a potential risk, which makes it exactly as bald-faced stupid as it seems. The stupidity here isn't in the fact that the made this particular bet, nor in the fact that it was assigned to him, but in the fact that he made the bet without *knowing* there was a (rather high, IMO) risk of assignment.

&gt; Are there any examples where that's actually a good idea?

(By ""that"" I'm going to assume you mean selling puts above ATH prices)

... I'm hard pressed to say that there are/come up with realistic examples of this working out well. Let's operate under the assumption that you're doing this while *aware* of the potential risk of it being assigned (which the subject of this post clearly was not). The only real reason I can imagine you making this bet is if you think (or somehow *know*) that some *extremely* good news is coming out soon. And even then, selling puts isn't really what you'd go for -- you'd go for buying some OTM calls to take advantage of the massive leveraged gains. 

The only reasonable situation I can think of is that you're very specifically trying to make free money; you *know* for a *virtual certainty* that the underlying security is going to jump the strike price and stay there until expiration. What you'd then do is sell naked puts *specifically to collect the premium*, then turn around and use that premium you just collected to buy otherwise very OTM calls. When the security rockets up in price (and you'd better be damn sure it's a *when* and not an *if*), the puts you sold will expire worthless and you'll have already leveraged the premium you got from it into 1000% gains or something. You'd literally have made free money.

You'd also probably become an insider trading suspect very quickly for making that particular set of trades, though, so... /shrug.  What you have to realize is that the set of trades I outlined will serve up hilarious amounts of free money, but it's also mind-bogglingly risky. If the stock doesn't go past the strike price (worst case scenario it goes *down*), not only will you have spent money on the calls that you won't be able to get back, you'll lose an amount equal to the difference between the strike price and the price at the time of expiration times 100 times however many puts you sold. Taking the example above, the assignment of puts there cost him 20 * 100 * ~7.4 = ~$15000... assuming he's able to sell off the SPY shares he got at the close price of the market today. Now granted, that's somewhat mitigated by the premium he collected, but in the hypothetical I outlined, he already used that premium to buy calls, so that's all gone too. 

So, uh... long story short... no. This is dumb. There might be obscure corner cases where it's worth doing, but I certainly can't think of any realistic ones.",MrMonday11235,wallstreetbets,6.0

I personally do not have a favorable opinion of Tesla, but if was going to YOLO in a long position on it with a multi-year time frame I would be so much happier having the stock then paying for those calls.  Perhaps low-probability but look at some of the worst-case scenarios here: imagine if TSLA doesn't get above 230/240 for long enough durring your investment time that you manage to get out in the green.  Your calls will be bleeding theta and you may have to sell for a loss.  If you have the stock at least you will be collecting dividends over that time frame, if it goes up over the 230/240 threshold after your time frame you can sell for the gains you wanted then, and no matter what at least your underlying doesn't theta decay.  There are good uses for calls over stocks, but from what I can understand of your investment horizon and goals you would probably be better off buying the stock directly.

4,2019-07-03,"Why there won't be any loss? I still see net loss:

7/19 $230c option premium value as of today: $8.75
Delta: 0.45
Theta: -0.32
After market open tomorrow, TSLA price will be $240
So, the option value will increase by: (240-230)*0.45 - 0.32 = $4.18

The value will be: 8.85 + 4.18 = 12.93

16,2019-07-03,"Exactly, brokers won't let you make trade that is outside your margin capabilities.     

One thing worth to mention is margin requirements.     

Brokers (like etrade) have their own requirements of how much cash you need to cover the short position.

Some solid stocks have low requirements, say 25%. Some highly volatile stocks may have 60% . Some require 100% coverage.     

For example , TSLA has 35% requirement - you only need enough cash to cover 35% of cost of shares in a potential assignment . And here where you need to be careful. Because it's their internal requirements and they may revise them , usually at the wrong moment.  It happened to me on etrade - they revised it and I got a margin call on Saturday when market was closed and I was quite content on Friday. I called them and said that it's wrong and they cannot do it when even AH market closed. And they very politely explained that they don't give a damn fuck about me.     

So don't over-stretch your margins.",surrealskiller,wallstreetbets,16.0

55,2019-07-02,"Here‚Äôs a [picture](https://i.imgur.com/45aCEEC.jpg) of my positions. 

Yes I made a directional bet that TSLA will reach around $300 by 12/20. However, because of time decay, TSLA needs to reach $310.50 in order for me to breakeven as stated on the options chain. Cost me roughly $2k. 

The option contracts do not automatically sell, so there‚Äôs the risk that if I forgot about them, the expiration date would come and my options would expire worthless. 

&gt;	if it hits 300 on Nov 30 and 330 on Dec 1, can you hold to sell at 330?
    Finally, can you choose to hold it if the shares go to 330 on Nov 30?

you can sell whenever you want to, but say TSLA is at $330 on 12/20 exp. The morning of, you would have made a ton of profit. But by 3:59pm of that day, time decay would reduce your profits to $0 even if you had been up $1000 that morning. Thats why i recommend not holding any options that expire in less than a month.

4,2019-07-04,"I generally don't give specific trade recommendations to people, but I will cover some broad gambling categories.

It entirely depends on what you're looking for with respect to risk:amusement ratio. Like do you want to win most of the time small amounts and then lose it all in a blaze of glory? If so then you should actually take the opposite trade of what you did -- short volatility. Shorting S&amp;P 500 volatility wins small amounts most of the time. The problem is that when it loses it loses massively. If you short it, you can end up owing more money than you deposited in to your brokerage account. What better way to go down in flames than to have a $600k debt to your broker when you only deposited $100k?

If you like roller coasters or just want to lose it all faster, trade options with &lt;= 5 days until expiration on SPX or SPY. Call = bet price will go up faster than the market is expecting, put = bet price will go down faster than the market is expecting. It's more complicated than that, but if you're looking to gamble $35k, you don't need to understand more. As long as you buy options, you can't lose more than what you paid for the options, but unlike a stock, if you made the wrong move they will go to $0 at expiration day, but oh the manic-depressive ride you'll have along the way. You can last a little longer by not actually throwing all of your money in to a single trade, but you'll still throw it all away eventually unless you get lucky.

If you just want to gamble for fun and extend it out longer term, just find some stocks you like and buy them when they go down a bit (aka Buy the Dip strategy) or find some stocks that move a lot (TSLA, BYND, pretty much any recent IPO) and ride those waves. Less likely to lose it all in a week than yoloing options and you'll still get a lot of thrill out of it (assuming it goes your way at least some of the time).

Despite my love of WSB, I don't personally do yolos. I do trade near expiration options, but to each their own.

Amusingly I personally wanted to long S&amp;P 500 volatility at market close today as I'm actually expecting volatility to rise soon, but I got side tracked with something (forgot to take my adderall and zoned out) and missed the market close.",aint_no_lie,wallstreetbets,4.0

If you haven't read Zero to One, take an evening and churn through it. It's actually interesting as fuck, even if you disagree with what's said. It doesn't try and sell you anything, just shedding some perspective on how to SPOT a behemoth (because when you see it, it's too late to reap massive rewards), and how the market values them so differently today. You can disagree with market behaviour, but the goal is to make money, aye? Why not understand market behaviour instead of hoping it falls back to figure.

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b9idoa/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_april_05/ek4ymwb/

""fun tesla numbers

based on revrec standards and napkin math, 90,700 vehicles delivered (required to recognize revenue) brought in 7.23Bn for an average of $79,713/car

we know in q1 2019 they delivered a lot fewer cars

""Deliveries were approximately 63,000 vehicles, which was 110% more than the same quarter last year, but 31% less than last quarter. This included approximately 50,900 Model 3 and 12,100 Model S and X.""

that's going to represent 5.0Bn in revenue for the quarter, assuming the sales mix stayed exactly the same (which we know it didn't since the models S and X delivered were reduced by almost half)

i don't know what their Q1 revenue guidance was, but they are almost definitely going to miss and by a lot

Edit: I'm probably going to do some new math tonight as I'm aware tesla gets revenue from non-vehicle sales.""

turns out i was estimating high and non-vehicle revenue was significantly lower than expected (down almost 20% YoY), resulting in net revenue of 4.5Bn

based on the same napkin math (unchanged margin) and adjusted to say that revenue from non-vehicle sales remained constant;

revenue should be in the 6.34Bn range for automotive and 300MM for non-auto for a total around 6.64Bn, given the speed of the shanghai build and the changes in the panasonic issues it wouldn't surprise me to see capital expenditures way up (again). there's also less ZEV available to them and i believe they've lowered the price of their cars to account for the loss of tax credits, that represents another potential haircut to revenue

reminder that TSLA doesn't do revenue guidance, just deliveries. earningswhisper has estimated revenue at 6.78Bn which i think is definitely going to miss, and EPS of (1.78) which is always a crapshoot since TSLA uses the shadiest accounting practices available, but hard to imagine it won't continue to be below expectations.",ncsubowen,wallstreetbets,13.0

My biggest concern with options is that I'm not sure what the maturity would be.

When TSLA was at 180, I didn't know how fast it would recover. I just knew it would. So do I buy calls only a week out or so, which are really cheap but unlikely to payoff, or calls that expire 1 month out? Or 3 months out? Or 1 year out.

Now that I think about this, I think there are some quantitative heuristics that can give an indication of when the stock recovers. Or, if there arent any analytical heuristics, simulation based on historical volatility and the Greeks should have been able to help predict when it would go back up.

Luckily the last few days have been stellar for profits - I hope you've found the advice from the last few posts useful. Recommended options so far have been on point!

Again, plenty of opportunities to make $$$$$ on both sides. Bulls and bears can easily win in this market. Just a matter of timing your entries/exits right, picking some good stocks and being patient. Here are the stocks I'll be watching closely. Apologies if it's a bit rushed - I've got some deadlines to meet asap and the time dwindles.

**Stocks for the BULLISH crowd:**

* PYPL is a bullish power play rn. So is CRWD (can moon any second!)
* APPL and FB ain't looking too shabby if you're feeling bullish and want to play a FAANG. Keep an eye on TWTR, LK and XLNX as well
* SQ and ROKU should keep climbing up. Monster potential for SQ til the end of the week.
* If you want a longer dated call, ZEN and TWLO, and NYT won't let you down

**Stocks to play if you're feeling BEARISH:**

* COST, WMT, CMG, LYFT (Lyft puts only for a day or two... It should pick back up after)
* Bear power play: SFIX, NFLX
* TSLA. Very few reasons to be bullish, plenty to be bearish. If trading TSLA is your thing make sure you think twice before getting calls. Flip a coin 3 times, see if it lands on its side.

STAY AWAY FROM BA/CRM/BABA/SHOP (if you want your trades to be better than pure gambling). These are treacherous stocks atm.

Even if you don't like/agree with my picks, I encourage y'all to pick 2 or 3 stocks you know well and play on those. Consider fundamentals, study them charts.

**BULLISH:**

* Very bullish on Lyft. Beauty of a day for the stock, at  **+$2.04** **(3.41%)** I was bagholding and printed some solid tendies but chickened out and exited early.
* Bullish on ZS ( **+$0.52** **(0.62%)** ), OKTA ( **+$3.82** **(2.94%)**), TEAM ( **+$2.67** **(1.94%))**, Z (**+$1.33** **(2.72%)**)
* Also bullish on ROKU  **+$0.12** **(0.12%)** , Apple  **+$1.25** **(0.62%)** and LK (-$0.17 (-1.89%) )
* CRWD  **+$1.54** **(2.30%)** 

**BEARISH:**

Very bearish on Humana. Today **-$4.01** **(-1.52%)**

* Bearish on NFLX **+$3.77** **(1.00%)** and LULU.  **-$0.75** **(-0.40%)**
* TSLA (daily results don't matter. You can't be bullish here!)  **-$0.28** **(-0.12%)**

\-----------------------

Many of the stonks recommended yesterday were on fire! Let's see if the magic TA eight ball keeps it rollin. Again, individual stock plays seem a lot safer and potentially more lucrative. Check out the charts yourself and pick wisely :).

If bearish, I think the following are due for a bit of a drop that could print solid tendies on the daily:

* HUM might drop for a few days (and it's a good stock for swing trade IMO), but will continue it's uptrend and with the recent mention at Barron's and upgrades, it's a great addition to the portfolio
* NFLX, Illumina, LULU and Adobe are bear powerplays for the day
* If SHOP drops and you have a put, hold overnight
* Still very bearish on TSLA until earnings. After that it depends on guidance, and who knows with this company

If you're feeling bullish, wait for the drop and consider:

* CRWD calls will print tendies no matter what. There'll be some price manipulation but if you navigate the BS, it's a lucrative one
* ZS, OKTA, TEAM, Z, still tons of potential to go higher
* LYFT calls are a power play IMO
* ROKU is also a solid gamble. Will try to test ATH and even $120 this or next week
* LK and APPL should gap up soon, but you never know with these two

I'd also stay away from BA and CRM for now. Even BYND is an unreasonably expensive gamble.

Beware holding overnight unless you're feeling confident about whether we'll have a green/red day next.

If you do your research every now and then you hit a big winner like AMD or TSLA into the right direction and you turn $2000 into $4000 profit. Those are like one in a month kind of days. Once or twice a year you will hit a 500% bagger if the overall market and the sector you invest in all go up or down the way you predict for 2-3 days in a row.

Important think is don't hunt for the big winners, be happy taking 15% profit better then losing 30%. Every week there is at least 2 days that will kill option players on either side. If you go hunting for big winners on those days you will bankrupt yourself. That's also why you never go all in weeklies, pretend like your playing poker.

Just keep in mind when writing options typically you have a high probability of making a little money and low probability of losing a lot of money. Versus the buy side where you have a high probability of losing a fixed amount and a low probability of getting a yacht. 

Consistency in your strategy is the key. If you stay consistent you should remain profitable and will withstand when those pesky ""rouge waves"" hit. Also, don't margin yourself more than you can handle.

The funny thing about optionsellers.com guy is that his trades probably would have been ultimately profitable had he not been margined up to his eyeballs and been force liquidated at the worst possible time. He could've rode the subsequent bounce.

The distance of $DJI above its 200 week moving average (sort of the amplitude of the irrational exuberance) is 24% today. In 1929 is was 80% and1987 69% (nice) I'm just making this shit up but my impression is the bubble has plenty of room for more air. The selloff in December deflated things a bit. If rates are cut more gainz can happen. Much of it is already p r i c e d  i n so I wouldn't expect +3% on 7/31 but over the course of the rest of the year maybe a top of 28,600 for $DJI and 3240 for $SPX.

Trade is still an unresolved problem too and Trump isn't going to let that hurt his reelection chances. That could push us way up.

1,2019-08-01,"Even though this does not make sense in economic theory, price has a memory; as in the market is indeed dictated by emotions. This isn't as stochastic as your average day trade price fluctuations, rather we can thank retail traders (like us autists) for trading with emotions and thank institutional traders to let that happen. Look at $TSLA - 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2019 observed prices from $150 and $190 for relative lows. Does it make sense that the bottom price is around the same, even though this time around, TSLA missed earnings drastically? No, I think TSLA should be at $130. But the market is irrational and doesn't work that way. If and when BYND reaches the 52 week high, everyone will be loading up on puts, and I think you should be taking the other side and buy those cheap contracts after a small dip in price.  My favorite market quote comes from economist John Keynes: The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. When it breaks the 52 week high, the ones that lost money will likely emotionally load up on calls because they think it ""broke resistance, so it can't go tits up."" Articles will be written about how the stock will be like buying McDonalds in 1988. Your brokers will gladly take the other side of your FD plays. This is when you should short, and short generously. The markets cannot sustain a 96%+ long as there needs to be somebody on the other end of every trade. When you take that 25:1 bet it may seem stupid, but when it does crash, you'll quit your job and try to trade full time and fail and blame everything on accidentally making SPY 42069c instead of 300c.... or so I want you to think.",Rongtian,wallstreetbets,1.0

2,2019-08-11,"Writing options into earnings is pretty degenerate. Companies use quarterly reports to announce a lot of important shit (have you heard of $STMP?). Look at $UBER, announcing a cool $6 billion loss because this just happened to be a ""peak investment year"". Stocks with high IV are usually Biotechs or fairly immature Tech companies, you never know what to expect on earnings (look what happened to $SRPT last week, a well known large-cap Biopharma). 

It's best to wait for IV to jump on some random catalyst (Trump tweets) and then sell options that expire BEFORE earnings - but this is not a ""quick payoff"" like selling directly into earnings is. In fact, you may lose money initially, especially if vega continues to expand. This also requires somewhat active management of your trades. You can reduce your gamma risk by selling options dated 2-3 weeks after the earnings report, but again, no quick payoff &amp; still quite risky as you have more vega to deal with. 

Sometimes implied volatility gets ridiculous. But no matter how high it gets, selling options (at any time) can still implode your account. $BYND was one example. I can't blame anyone for selling premium into that. But look how much this thing has swung since IPO. Back before $TSLA options got destroyed this year, you could sell a 200P/400C strangle every month for stupid amounts of premium. But that was because of shit like ""funding secured"".

If you're gonna do this, start with spreads and take it slow. I don't recommend shorting naked options unless you have a decent amount of experience &amp; discipline in trading and managing risk. The options market isn't perfect - we had a 12 handle on the VIX like 2 weeks ago because this autistic market was absolutely certain trade talks were going well. Market makers handle the risk by going short/long the underlying stock - the poors of WSB will never be able to do that. It's not easy money. It's a calculated risk, like all investments are.

Lost a ""significant amount"" the other week and wasn't feeling too great (95k). Took a break from shitposting in order to concentrate and focus on making money even though I still modded around here. Have made about 75-80% of the losses back and am within striking distance of my ATH. Am still trying to improve as a trader. Losses were mostly from futures because I have a hard time taking small losses, and my position size was too large. Today I plan to take profits and go short if /ES goes to the 2935-2940 range. I have contracts on all the indices and will close out all and focus on scalping ES afterwards. If /ES doesn't reach my profit taking zone, I may close out above my stop loss and enter short if that seems to be the direction it's going. Other than futures, I am still playing with AMZN, TSLA, NDX, and SPX. Short calls on AMZN are in trouble if the market continues up. Short call strikes of 1815, 1835, and 1850 for this week.

Work backward from a forward PE of 8 at their current valuation: At their $35k price target they need 20% of the US/EU market at 15% GM and 15% of that going to the bottom line.

It may seem like you're seeing nicer brands, but the data are showing that the average age of cars on the road are at an all time high. [Source](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2019/06/28/average-vehicle-age-ihs-markit/1593764001/)

This suggests that it's not people living beyond their means, but people stretching their budgets to the max, taking out whatever long-term loan has the lowest monthly payment, driving the car for longer, and defaulting at an elevated (though not disastrous) rate. This is not a good sign for the consumer economy, but it suggests a recession is less likely to be a bubble bursting and more of slow grinding halt as more people fall into financial trouble.

Probably can expect to see a strong flood of used cars coming into the market. This will be helpful to those of you looking to trim costs and improve your household budget, but there's probably not a quick play for cash. (Though I think Ford might be screwed long-term for other reasons.)

Major downside is when it does go below and you lost the past 6 months worth of pennies.


Alternatively, you can sell puts on higher IV companies (typically tech stocks or shit like TSLA) and collect a huge premium, TSLA's is like $1000 for a 15% OTM put. The obvious downside is if you get assigned you'll buy 100 shares/contract worth of stocks. It's not bad if you don't mind holding the stock.

I'm new here and by new I mean obviously this is an alt to some reputable account. Check my profile: I've been scraping together karma from the dregs of suggested subreddits and accruing time to be allowed to post here.  
  
So obviously I'm a 16-year-old autistic girl with enough money to break out of the rat race and I wanna do it while doing my part to fight climate change. I figured this is where I belong.  
  
So Greta Thunberg (pronounced ""Toonberry"", you uncultured troglodytes) is driving around Murica in a Tesla Model 3, so $TSLA 420c expiring after record Q3 earnings, right? And puts on oil.  
  
Just kidding. I'm in the EU and my bank has the worst UI for trading options, so I've been making gains recently to recover my n00b losses from before, which were most from (prepare to laugh) buying $TSLA high and selling low. I've earned about 25% back so far from trading actual stonks (it's easy, they always go up), because of said shit UI. Also because of shit UI, I can't post a pic that anonymously shows my investing history, so sorry about that, and it's why I'm posting here to avoid a ban.  
  
Any recommendations for banks/apps for trading options in the EU? Also, are there PDT rules in Europe that I need to watch out for? I read the terms of my bank and it sounds like they almost want me to day trade, not mentioning a minimum portfolio value or anything.

1,2019-10-12,"I tried several strategies this year, and the worst one where I lost the most money was... selling options on TSLA.

People on this sub are always blindsided by absolute gain numbers. When a guy posts +45k gain everyone for some reason assumes he turned 100 bucks to 45k. Without knowing the % gain +45k is a meaningless number that might indicate 3% gain. Also with premium selling the gain is not telling the full story, we need to take into account the collateral. If the guy is selling naked options and makes enough money it means his account is very likely over 100k to begin with. If we calculate the gain % properly without drolling over 45k gains his story won't be nearly as impressive as you imagine, I guarantee it.

So how I ended up losing money. Firstly I picked TSLA because the premium was high. I figured high premium makes the most sense for selling premium. But guess what, the premium is high for a reason, you will have to deal with wild 3% swings on a random day, and boy it swings. I was selling 1-2 weeks out put spreads, usually risking around 2500 to gain 500 (this is delta -0.3). I also tried selling naked couple times, but with the cash account collateral requirements this was just pennies. The problem is it can blow through your ""safe"" strikes in 2 days no problem. It went against me just 3 times where I lost almost full collateral amount, but with 1 to 5 win to loss ratio 3 losses wipe out 15 successful bets (which I didn't even have, I think I won maybe like 5 times before that).

Now before you say ""you can just keep rolling it until you win"". This is usually coming from people who never actually tried rolling anything, it's not as easy. Rolling is nothing more than selling for a full loss and opening even worse position than before to cover your loss, digging yourself into the hole deeper, both losing time and lowering your chances for success.

Anyway, selling TSLA was the last drop. I tried selling premium on other stocks before (safe stocks, safe strikes, 30+ days out, etc) and always ended up losing at the end or gaining pennies. I switched to buying ITM and it finally feels like odds are not against me. For the hell of it I tried buying ITM on TSLA, I thought it was the dumbest choice because of high premiums, but guess what, haven't lost once yet. Now I am thinking maybe high premium options are actually better for buying than for selling, want to test this theory once the dust settles a little from current trade wars.

Now theta gang will tell you how I just don't know what I am doing, that with selling premium you are the casino, etc.",lolnburn,wallstreetbets,1.0

So like a lot of you guys, I was always back and forth on Tesla.
Seemed like a great product and Musk seemed like a revolutionary, but he acted like a dumbass on Twitter and there were just so so so many analysts regularly taking dumps on anything and everything TESLA. 

But one day I walked by a TESLA store in Osaka, and for the first time in my life I actually sat down in one of their cars.

Fucking. Amazing.

The atmosphere in the store wasn't even LIKE a regular car dealership. It was like... a SCIENCE FAIR or something. So many people oohing and awing and asking questions about the technology. The sales people were ultra chill and gave me free coffee.

I've never been a big car guy, never gave a shit about sports cars or nice cars, but when I sat inside that Tesla and pulled up the onboard computer iPad-like thingy, HOLY SHIT. You can monitor almost everything in the car, and adjust everything in the car. It even told me the percentage of air in each tire.

And you can plug the car into your wall outlet and CHARGE IT like you CHARGE YOUR CELLPHONE. 

It was then that I knew, I had to YOLO TESLA.This was the company of the FUTURE.

So way back in March,I bought calls expiring in 01/20 and LEAPS for 1/21.Bought a little bit of $TSLA stock too, for my grandkids.
Not gonna lie brothers, *it was not an easy road*. My faith was tested often over that long summer. I spent a lot of money averaging down my 01/20 calls, and at one point was down like 75%.

But in retrospect I should have YOLO'ed even MORE. I should've MAXED OUT MY ROBINHOO GOLD and went truly BALLS DEEP.
But I'll take my profit, and thank Papa Musk, and thank God for my blessing.

$420 is on it's way, boys.

10,2019-11-03,"For his January 2020 calls,  he has 34 contracts. His avg price for each option is $11.42. Each contract has 100 options, so $11.42 x 100 = $1142 per contract.

$1142 x 34 contracts = $38,828 (The money he invested for this specific kind of calls)

You could've simply just bought 1 contract, leave it and forget about it and just do the same thing.

And he's up 100+%. Seeing that TSLA is undervalued at the time, he made a smart bet that TSLA should be up above $295 by next year. I say it was a very good and respectable bet. Though it wasn't guaranteed, his advantage was time. TSLA is very volatile, and if it goes up, it really pays off. Same way if it goes down. But if it goes down, as long as you gave yourself time for TSLA to bounce, then there's nothing to worry about.

When I talk about time, there are many options where you can choose different ""expiration dates"". I don't want to get in detail with that, but the shorter the expiry, the more tears you're gonna shed (meaning you're more likely to lose  imo). You're gonna want longer expiry. 

Strike prices are also something you have to look up.


Words of advice: Get out of here. With all due respect with all my fellow autists here, a lot of them make stupid trades. Sure some of them win those lottery tickets, but how about the rest?

Theoretically, everyone can be a winner in the stock market. So if you lose because of making a stupid bet, then shame on you.


If you're still confused about what I said, then please remember these:

Buy in-the-money calls/puts, with at least 3 weeks expiry if you want to have better chances of winning. Once you get the grasp of things, it's all up to you on the way you trade.

This is literally gambling with extra steps. You'll have a much better time learning to play Poker. Bunch of Indian Casinos are 18+. The buy in to even have a good time playing options is at least 10x what you have saved up. You can afford at most two decent plays.

I remember being 18 and having no money. The idea of getting ""rich"" quick was very appealing but if it was so easy, everyone would be driving lambos. You are way better off going to the personalfinance sub which actually has good advice for someone in your current situation. All you have to do is start a vanguard account and just dump as much money as you can in some growth fund. Stonks literally only go up over time which you have a lot of.

12,2019-11-09,"This is a hilarious read:

&gt; Tesla  (TSLA) and Chemours (CC) were material losers during the quarter. TSLA shares recovered from $223.46 to $240.87. Unit sales in the June quarter improved more than we expected compared to the March quarter.
Even so, TSLA appears to continue to spin positive PR ahead of the safety and fair treatment of its customers. For example, in August Walmart sued TSLA because its solar panels were catching on fire. Rather than warn its solar customers when TSLA became aware of the fire risk, TSLA allegedly created Project Titan ‚Äì a covert program to replace the defective components while staying out of the news. Similarly, in response to a series of car battery fires, instead of recalling the batteries, TSLA appears to have quietly issued a ‚Äúsoftware update‚Äù to the battery management system that has a side effect of reducing battery range. TSLA has chosen not to warn or compensate its customers for the decreased performance.
Finally, to the surprise of nobody, documents in TSLA‚Äôs SolarCity litigation unsealed in September showed that Elon Musk knowingly orchestrated a significant fraud by arranging the $2.6 billion acquisition at a time when SolarCity was insolvent. Musk and his family had a huge conflict of interest, but rather than properly recusing himself, Musk initiated the transaction and drove the process. SolarCity was so cash-strapped, it was trying to delay payments to vendors after parts were delivered and the vendors had recognized the revenue; SolarCity could not raise any funds at reasonable rates from third parties; and Musk engineered the unveiling of the Solar Roof tile to convince TSLA‚Äôs shareholders to approve the deal, even though the product did not exist at the time. As was the case with Musk‚Äôs extraordinary ‚Äúfunding secured‚Äù tweet last year, we believe this level of trampling of standard processes of corporate governance, ignoring methods to deal with related party transactions and self-dealing should lead to substantial consequences. For now, the accepted reality appears to be that Elon Musk is above the law.",getbodied99,wallstreetbets,12.0

52,2019-11-11,"I mean a recession. This has so far played out like so many have before. 

Incredible deceit on the part of Wall Street and government institutions (mainly pensions and thrifts; misinterpretation of David Swensen‚Äôs work on private equity, promises of yearly 7% returns, etc). Large excesses in corporate debt, private equity, government accounts. Fueled by hopes instead of reality. A market propped up by buybacks bought largely using debt. All this makes for the 2nd most expensive market in US history measured by CAPE ratio (higher than 1929 and slightly less than 1999; if you put in updated numbers for this year were barely below 1999 levels; Shiller stopped updating his figures in September 2019 and any data you find online will not include recent information). 

The only thing keeping default rates low right now is the high issuance of corporate debt this past year, which depresses default rates similar to pre-1990 (until liquidity disappeared and those so called zombie companies which currently account for 16% of US businesses all went belly up). This is why December 2018 happened, as debt issuance went to 0 similar to 1990 but companies did not go bankrupt as they were able to roll over their debts as 2019 began. 

Basically we‚Äôre on life support and global economic data continues to worsen. Leading indicators are still moving down and sentiment is still pricing in the idea that what has been the case in the recent past will continue forever into the future. Institutions are still buying CLOs as well as other debt instruments, making a significant amount of debt liquidity, but if that fails for an extended period of time say because of negative earnings growth or recession fears (like in 1990), we will see the first extended bear market in 10 years at a time when monetary policy is limited (pushing on a string). When Warren Buffett has been a net seller the past 9 months with 60%+ in cash, I start to be cautious. 

The issue is timing. More like the inability to reliably time the market. For long assets, value outperforms in a bear market. But most of the market is overvalued. Buying an index at these prices is speculation. It‚Äôs why Warren said recently when questioned about his cash pile and why he doesn‚Äôt put it into indexes, he says that there would be a time to use it and it‚Äôs when everyone is panicking. Now is not that time. In other words, do as greatness does, not as greatness says (his indexing talk is meant for the average know nothing investor, not for the enterprising investor, himself included). 

The only bull market (that I know of) that is valid today is that central banks will loosen into oblivion, but they have already not done so. I believe they will act too late as they have always done and as this pause indicates. But in a world governed by deterministic chaos, no one can know for sure. Either way, now is the exact wrong time to be going 1.3m in leverage and buying TSLA calls.

Would be great if it just tanked all day and broke 330, but also looking for another PM gap down or quick dip to 340ish at open to roll right into calls. Any opening gap or dip is good news, if it opens high probably still good for puts but have to double down on a losing position there and risk that it just keeps pumping up, while if it opens low you can roll profitable puts into cheap calls. Worst case is it opens flat and starts to pump up right away, I'll get some calls then, but not sure if I'll cut losses on the puts right away or wait for 360 to break. I'm nervous about getting juked by a reversal, but that cost me big today when I sold my calls at 333. Who is to say shop cant beat 369 or 333 tomorrow? Or flirt with 400 this week? Pullback before continuing up sure, but are you more generally bullish or bearish from 350? The way shes been moving I think anything from 320-380 is possible tomorrow and 333-369 is a reasonable EOD target, we probably still get something like 340-360 at worst for a flat day. I think we could even break 310-390 this week if we are lucky. How do you see it? Shop gonna beat tsla to 420 or is it all hot air? 350 is a crazy level to trade at, I feel she still has to move bigly from here, no?

The catalyst IMO for SCVL is time attrition.  All these small short positions (I assume most people are poor and can't hold large short positions) are probably 100-1000 shares.  They've been short presumably for nearly half a year or more now and are all underwater if you track the share price.  However, it's probably not underwater enough for these shorts to cover (especially considering it cost them nothing to short).  The way to force these autistic WSB losers out is to either pump this, or time.

$AMRN is shit and only has value because it was the first. $MTNB and $ACST are the real competitors. Both are shithole penny stocks and I believe they have the right to beat $AMRN. They're both better drugs, and they both are earlier in their stages so they're cheap now. Both companies have seemingly good financials.

But fuck $ACST.

CaPre ($ACST) isn't as good as MAT9001 (god awful name $MTNB) and there's some shit about having to lose weight to do the drug. This is medication for people having heart attacks. Good luck losing weight with that one buddy.

Anywho, tendies if you invest in either but I think $MTNBIKE is the best. Plus, it's up and the other is down today.

TL;DR: All in $TSLA puts.

You could tell that those dudes thought they were the shit in their own heads, but they couldn't communicate with other people in a business environment.

Always found that pretty interesting. A lot of engineers will hit a salary ceiling and stay there the rest of their life because they don't feel comfortable moving into management or starting something on their own.

Earlier in the week I got 4k worth 95 strike TWLO calls and about 400AMD shares, but next day trump comes out with that trade comment that he can wait till after election, scared me out of my positions for a loss, next day TWLO goes to 99. Rotated into EA puts the next day and it stayed green while rest of market tanked, sold for loss. Today was okay I bought 312 1 week calls on SPY yesterday over 100% gain but I only spent 600 unfortunately. Sold my 5k worth of SPY 312 strike 4 weeks expry yesterday, unwilling to bet so much on jobs report, and moved some of that to DIS, but DIS barely moved today. Sold those calls for minor loss. Played a little on CRM earnings and lost, shoulda know it'd barely move. But biggest loss was that EA put with the DIS calls second highest loss. Down 1500 this week. All my SPY plays were gains.

Decided to not buy calls anymore. Be smarter about my trading. I'll just buy shares on margin and buy them by selling puts. There's really no reason for me to buy options because my margin account sma is so high from past margin use in 2018. With 12k account I can get about 50k margin. A 5% move in stocks I own would represent 20% account swing and its less dangerous than buying options. Plus can get premiums for selling options. If I diversify stock holdings then margin call shouldn't be an issue unless the market itself crashes. Today I started this plan and already got over $500 in premium for sold puts (TWLO 98, TTD 247.5, NET 17.5). I got assigned TTD (by $0.15) but that's okay. Plan to sell call on it Monday, and calls sell for a lot, near money is like $600. Stocks I bought were small posotions just to diversify. 10 ULTA, 10 TSLA, 100 AMD.

I do have some more questions. Why is there such a big discrepancy in the gamma flip levels of SPX and SPY? Which one has a bigger impact on the market? I assume SPX? I‚Äôve been following Charlie McElligot‚Äôs work and he seems to focus solely on SPX to calculate gamma risk in the market. Do you think the SPY levels are also important to catch a large move down? 

How can a short term trader take advantage of weekly gamma levels on individual stocks? I noticed on Friday expiration, there was a few stocks that made good moves higher around their flip zones (TSLA, BA). Is it typically to move higher once gamma flips from negative to positive? Or was that an expiration Friday thing? I noticed the flip zone changed again for some stocks- I guess it changes weekly (daily) due to opening and closing positions? How do you trade stocks around their flip zone? Should I be avoiding long trades in stocks with large amounts of negative gamma (and vice versa for shorts)? 

Thanks again for your time and any insights!",starfirer,wallstreetbets,41.0
