CRSR can and probably will hit 40-60 but trying to time when that will happen with the contract prices where they are? You'll probably barely break even (if somehow CRSR goes to 45) or lose it all. Even if their fundamentals and comparative competitions indicate a hold, they have lockup period ending pretty soon and that will probably keep prices depressed for a longer period of time. All the people shilling short-term options are holding bags and desperately trying to unload. For CRSR atm, it's better to buy stocks (I know I know, we're wsb how dare I).

BBBY, 19c 5/21

NFLX, 520p 02/19

SFIX, 60p 02/19

The puts, I wish I bought more of (actually, same for the calls) but I got fucked up with some meetings for work and market closed before I could make any extra moves. They're (the puts) a small portion of my portfolio. I have other long positions that I'm holding onto.

The weed plays, I was even wondering what would happen with a 1/1 split (1 republican senator is all it takes for legislation to pass). They may just as well continue to soar now that Dems have the trifecta, though. Either way, I dated them longer bc I like giving my options time to run up and not getting theta fucked. Guranteed profits over trying to gamble and time.

BBBY, I dated way later than most people here because of a couple of reasons. First off, XMAS sales won't be included in the current earnings report. Second off, accelerated stock buybacks won't be finished until Q1/Q2 of 2021 - not enough time for runup to happen if you bought mid to late Jan options like most people did.

NFLX and SFIX were just some good old fashion elbow grease as far as research - the occasional DDs here that agreed with the thesis did help me feel a sense of confirmation bias forsure. NFLX mostly bc they benefited the most from the Trump tax cuts (by a bit, actually) and SFIX because if you look at their fundamentals and their runup, they were due for a correction.

I've sold a lot of what I bought pre-2014, but here are a few more screenshots of stock I bought way back when. My wife, who studied economics at Harvard, tried to calm me down in 2008 when our 401k got cut in half with the market crash, telling me it was absolutely the time to buy, buy, buy, which we did--sank $20k into a bloody market. I bought AMZN, NFLX, SIRI, GM, F, and a bunch of shit that died (Blockbuster) or was reborn, like GE, with the original stock left to rot. And each year I'd drop another $10k-$15k in the market, watching our 401k bounce back.

2,2021-03-07,"When I started investing, I lost a shitton of money.  Years ago after several years of savings and investments, I had a 70K account. I yolo'd all into barely out of the money calls on a stock I thought had dipped for unjustified reasons.  I was right and would have made money, but I paper handed out and instead ended up losing 40K of my bankroll.  It was devastating.  That was years of gains gone in less than a day.  I put down trading for 6 months or a year and thought my dreams of making huge tendies were over.  

I kept saving money and just reading about stocks, derivatives and just financial news in general.  I tossed my 30K into AMZN and NFLX and just let it sit.  

Kept saving and with huge gains from amzn and nflx all of a sudden, I had 400K 6 years ago.  Some more trades here and there and now I'm at 2.5 million only 4 years later (it would have been way more had I been more aggressive in my positions.  I'd call my trading style mostly retarded with a significant dash of boomer caution).  

Don't ever give up.  If you take a loss, you are just paying the market.  Losses may seem extreme but remember - I went down to 30K, invested in a boomeresqe manner and made it up to 2.5M in just over 10 years.  You can do that too - especially with all these financial crisis and inflation bubbles all over the place.

Finally REMEMBER!  Most people are not even aware of the stock market as an out to the bad aspects of their life.  They just think it goes up 8% a year and discount that as not being enough to really impact their life when in fact, it is one of the few ways Plebs like us can get a piece of the pie.  If your attempt at doing that fails, then you are just back where you were, working your job like 95% of your co-workers who have their money in mutual funds.

Lots of halfway decent normal non-space things in it, DE, NFLX, but why not throw money into a boring non-space ETF if you want exposure to large caps in multiple sectors?  But if IV is halfway decent might be an ideal candidate to wheel due to price, write CSPs on it and if you get assigned write ATM CCs on it and hot potato it out.  Trying that on something with high IV and high share price like ARKK at 120-125 turns into a 12500 dollar commitment so ARKX might turn out to be better at a 20-25 share price and 2000-2500 commitment.

I've had three calls in the last week that came alive 1 week before expiry... one I ended up losing 100% on because I waited literally a few minutes too long and kept holding onto hope as it kept decreasing, one for a 40% loss and the other for a 60% profit... both of which continued up all week and my options would've been 4x.  

I rolled my NVDA profits into calls that are one quarter out on stocks that dipped following earnings or a big announcement (NFLX, TSM, ETSY). I'm going to be anxious for the next couple months. 

Anyway, if you got any hot tips, let me know. :)",h4ppyfolk,wallstreetbets,3.0

4,2021-08-04,"Legit answer here: your stock picks are shit. If you are trying to gamble your positions are awful because you're basically playing roulette and betting on green when the payout is 0.2 to 1 if it hits. If you literally pick all WSB stock picks you are actually a retard chasing after the train after it's already left the station, or going to your local palm reader for financial advise.

My suggestion, throw a decent portion of your portfolio (25%-50%) at FAANG (FB, AAPL, AMZN, NFLX, GOOG) or similar stable high growth stocks in long-term (5 to 35 year holdings) long positions and you can play with the rest IF you are legit trying to invest. If you're trying to gamble use options so at least you can feel like you're in Vegas and lose just as much money twice as fast, my suggestion is starting with ITM call spreads for bullish and ITM put spreads for bearish until you get a feel for market trends, press releases, earnings reports, etc. I would almost always suggest to NEVER do OTM weeklies unless you know damn well what you're doing since that is normally just throwing money at the wind. But if you want to be a true WSB autist this is the way, everyone goes through that phase and some of us never leave and just eat -100% every friday.

Good luck have fun, and read some goddamn 10-Ks and 10-Qs before throwing money at a company if you're serious about making money",TheNewsmonger,wallstreetbets,4.0

$DIS is growing, albeit at a slower rate than the market. It has actually declined slightly in market share.

 $VIAC has the best growth rate in the sector. PlutoTV went from 70 MM (2018) to 1 Billion (2021) ahead of schedule, and SVOD grew 92% (P+, Showtime). Pluto will surpass $Roku MAUs this year. 

To add, 25% of new signups last quarter were for P+. This will grow with NFL season (10 year rights) and reclaiming content. Approx. 25% of demand for licensed content on Netflix, Peacock, and Prime is VIAC content.

On top of all this, VIAC is expanding to over 40 countries by EoY 22 (with support from CMCSA).

4,2021-09-06,"I'm so confused as to why you're confused. ""Video game store in the midst of streaming,"" is exactly why that stock was undervalued. Most investors thought it was the next Blockbuster. So the stock price kept falling and falling. While everyone else filed into $NFLX as it was the next stock bandwagon.

Also, you're not making the distinction between necessary conditions and certainty that something will happen. A stock can meet all of these criteria and it still might not squeeze. However a stock will never squeeze if it does not at least meet these criteria.

Occam's Razer is a philosophical tool that boils down to this: If something can be explained adequately by known variables, it is not necessary to introduce new ones.

This is a very solid company with good assets and stable income, I was also very impressed how it behaved the last few days, it went down less than the rest of the market. 

I don't share you enthusiasm though, it's undervalued compared to the rest of the market because it was oversold in march but not much more then that, the comparison to NFLX imo is far fetched.

It has the potential to grow and it's biggest chance to reach &gt;70$ is if somebody will buy it or if there will be a merger(I think the chance is high, there are too many players now in the streaming market).

I like your 2023 60 calls, it's somewhat risky but not bad, the January 45 I don't know, they might print but it's pretty soon and I think it's more likely it will not go above 45 until January, and if you continue holding them they will be worth 0, I would consider selling them when the stock hits 42/end of October which ever comes sooner.

First of all they've already announced they'll cut the dividend when they spin DirecTV off.

Secondly, T is a utility. Everyone already has a phone and TV. Competition in both industries is cutthroat (DTV has to compete with NFLX and Comcast and the like) so the only way to grow is to steal market share from someone else.

The Time Warner part has some value but the TV properties are stagnant/dying as well. Movies aren't dead but the post-corona way they will be distributed will obviously be different from the past.

So the reason you own something like T is for the cashflow/dividend/breakup value. Maybe DTV and TW are better off on their own or owned by someone else. Lot of uncertainties for a company that's supposed o have high-certainty profits.",xkulp8,wallstreetbets,10.0

Let's say you sell 20M cars at an average of 45K.  If you have a profit margin of 30% per car, which TSLA has right now, that is a profit of 270B.  If that were true you'd have a PE of 29.",MarginCarl,wallstreetbets,6.0

Like consider AMZN, aapl, msft‚Ä¶ those stocks have seen multi thousand percent gains and it‚Äôs STILL not too late to buy those.  I firmly believe TSLA is in its early stages en route to being the largest, most valuable company in history. 


For background, I saved ~$330k into my 401k over 14 years of work.  In Nov 2019 I changed jobs and moved my 401k into a rollover ira‚Ä¶ this allowed me to invest in individual stocks.  Initially I diversified my investment into ~20-30 stocks (aapl, AMZN, nflx, COVID stocks, etc)‚Ä¶

Watched NFLX break below 650 on Monday and I was holding a couple puts so I thought all was good.  Hits 643.90 and all of a sudden on Barchart, I see a ton of calls opened on the unusual options page.  2k at 650, 1.5k at 665, 1k at 700 (guessing at the numbers but they were multi-million $ positions).  And despite no volume on the actual underlying stock (at least on Yahoo), it makes a V shaped recovery back to 650.  Of course, I bought a call.

I‚Äôve been looking for other places to put more money into. Is there any specific reason why NFLX has dropped from $700 to $600 or isn‚Äôt it just a normal correction due too rapid growth?
