2,2018-01-07,"Honestly, I don't think so. I think SPX is better in terms of taxes, and liquidity. Just more expensive though if buying naked calls/puts and constructing spreads. I guess the only benefit is you could enter SPY at a discount if the trade didn't go your way and you were assigned? Other than that, I can't personally think of any benefit. I could be mistaken though. What broker do you use?",WSEnthusiast,wallstreetbets,2.0
3,2018-01-07,"Yeah your strategy sounds pretty solid and somewhat similar to mine. I have 2 different types of spreads I'll use. If it's on an index like SPY QQQ or a sector etf I will typically short a delta of around 0.1 about 2 weeks out and the long depends on what I feel is the best at the time. But for SPY I typically aim for a 0.10-0.20 spread and I'll usually sell about 80-100 of those. So it uses a decent amount of capital but it rarely stops out in this market so it's still worth it to me. For that trade I will stop out if I lose 2x what I stand to gain, so for a 0.1 spread I'll stop if it widens to 0.3. Since the trade has such a heavy chance of going in my favour I'm fine with risking more capital. For that one I'll also let it expire worthless unless it stops out since the commissions are high on those. 

But for spreads on stocks I will base the spread off of the stock rebounding off a support or resistance whether I'm going bull or bear. So in this case the delta are usually pretty high on the short, like around 0.4 or so but this is fine because over a large amount of trades I still profit because of theta decay as well as credit spreads basically just being rigged to the seller's advantage. 

And for those trades I don't base the stop off of an amount lost, I base it off of the underlying going below/above a certain price. So I play those basically exactly as I would going long or short commons or long options, just have theta on my side instead is the main difference. 

Examples of a couple of the recent trades for the start of 2018 that I've already closed out were SBUX, JNJ, MMM, HON, SQ, SPY. MMM was a dick though and went low during the day, stopped me out, then climbed back up so that was unfortunate, but the other 3 all paid out for me. For sizing those positions though I usually go for $700 credit because I expect to usually pay roughly $100 in commission and close out the spread when it has around $100 left so I'm left with around $500 from a successful position. 

I'll be honest though, it's refreshing talking to someone on here that understands what they're doing and aren't just gambling for the fk of it.

4,2018-01-07,"Always mixing up the two. But the few times i traded it, I traded the index option (SPX). Since my fees are calculated per contract, it's cheap to just trade one contract of SPX, instead of 10 SPY. Are there any advantages of SPY contracts over SPX contracts?",satireplusplus,wallstreetbets,4.0
5,2018-01-07,"That would apply to SPX, not SPY. ",WSEnthusiast,wallstreetbets,5.0
6,2018-01-07,"I mean sure but the point is that if you had 10% bonds going into 2008 and bought the dip of BAC you'd have effectively doubled your shares than if you just held BAC. Obviously that's retarded to be 100% BAC but point is generally true.

Rebalancing in a recession is one of the easiest ways to get tons of #gains. Unfortunately during a recession a lot of people lose their jobs etc. but if you have a secure income source, or could scale back your expenses as needed/have minimal debt it makes sense to risk it.

Right now I have a good chunk in general shit like QQQ/FDGRX and probably too much in alibaba right now lol. Also a bit in SOXL. Also like 2 shares of MJX because funny. But that doesn't represent a big portion of my portfolio it's mostly for fun. 

I'm stupidly bullish mostly because I actually will prolly make more money in a market collapse than if it continues going upward (Significant equity I don't mind yolo'ing into stock market but would want to wait for a true dip/recession to do so). 

That being said if we have another insane year (20%) SPY I might go like 40% bonds just because it'd seem pretty stupid at that point.

7,2018-01-08,"No I'm ***shorting*** the 3x short. Look, I believe the S&amp;P 500 will go up. I can either buy the normal ETF, the 3x long ETF, or I can ***short*** the 3x short. Let's say I make a 5 day long trade. Day 1, the index goes up 2%, day 2 down 1%, day 3 up 1%, day 4 down 2%, day 5 up 3%. 

If all ETFs start at $100, this is how they would behave:

The underlying (which is the index or the index ETF, say SPY): 100 -&gt; 102/100.98/104.01/101.93/104.99

Profit on my trade is 4.99%.

3x long: 100 -&gt; 106/102.82/105.9/99.55/108.51

Profit on my trade is 8.51%. This is more than the normal ETF, but not quite 3x as much, in fact not even twice as much. This is leverage decay. 

3x Short: 100 -&gt; 94/96.82/93.91/99.55/90.59.

Since I'm shorting it, my profit is initial price - final price, 100-90.59=$9.41=9.41%, which is the most out of all of these, and this effect gets stronger the longer you track leveraged ETFs. That's why they tell you don't ever hold leveraged ETFs for long, some people say don't even hold them over night, because they decay. It's just maths, when you look at it for a bit you'll get it. Shorting both the 3x long and the 3x short in equal volumes should, in theory, be a license to print money basically while staying completely risk neutral. If I shorted both in the trade above I would've made $0.90 with absolutely 0 risk, I wouldn't care whether the S&amp;P 500 was at 100 or 30k the next day, I'm still making money. Too bad it doesn't work.

What's important to note about the leverage decay is that it isn't usually as extreme as I pointed out, you don't get this close to the underlying in 5 days, because the S&amp;P 500 usually doesn't go up ordown by 1,2 or 3% every day for a whole week, this was just to demonstrate it more clearly, but it should work for all sets of conceivable moves that go in both directions, I just used a random set of numbers.

9,2018-01-08,"They showed up on the cheap calls/puts list I post every Monday.

I bought them on November 16th, looks like SPY closed at $258.62 that day, so ~6% OTM.

Bought them for $0.53. That's actually one of the more expensive options I've ever bought, but felt more comfortable since it's an index ETF than an individual security.

Anytime I buy an option, I just assume it isn't going to ever be at the money, so I'm just looking for good returns leading up to the strike. This one went way further than I was expecting.

Probably going to put a sell stop on it, as I'm feeling like the downside risk is much higher than the upside return right now. IV looks pretty low on it though.

Idk if I believe fully in all those mumbo jumbo patterns, but a double bottom ONLY occurs when the underlying asset continues HIGHER than the peak of the double bottom, meaning that the SPY (for example) would need to close above 288.

A double top is a lot more likely if we continue lower, considering that's confirmed if we close below 255 (or so, to be safe, should wait to 253).

34,2018-04-02,"Bag holders are the ones who buy and commit large portions of their portfolio into strength. 

Buying on a dip will generally give you a greater advantage over someone who buys on an up day, especially if its an index you're buying.

1) you have a lower price

2) you have the same dividend.

so if you saved on 1% on the first point and guaranteed another 1% in dividends, you're now 2% better off than the guy who about at a high.

If all this is a reaction to tariffs...its an overreaction  for the following reasons:

1) 3 billion in goods is maybe 1% of the total trade between US and China.

2) Tariffs will take at least 6 months to implement and at least 6 months for the market to feel it or react.

3) The US and China are both smart enough to know that a trade war is dumb. Especially with such interconnected economies.  Even if a trade war happens, you can expect a market drop of maybe 40%, which is already expected, then reconciliation will happen, then you'd have a ""bull market"" again.  So as long as you have cash on hand, you're fine. Don't forget, each year the spy returns on average 6 to 8% + dividends.

4) If this were such a big issue, you'd have the big players pulling out...they aren't.

That means if a few stocks go up and people buy SPY to get a part of the action because everyone says NEVER BUY SINGLE STOCKS YOU WILL LOSE ALL YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ONLY BUY ETFS, this fact alone will pull the other 499 stocks in the index upwards.

Is MartyMoho being told that ""we all the sudden now care about the users and not to give bad advice and you don't know what you're doing""? 

  


Is MartyMoho being told to stop shitposts  or you'll be banned etc..?

Volume rate of change charts are what I use to measure how we're doing and across the board volumes were low. After looking at charts day in and day out for the past 3 months you get used to this faux bull rally shit, happened last week and it happened again today. You can usually tell it's going to hit some major psychological resistance level and even if it breaks if the bull volume doesn't continue to keep it above that it usually spells trouble. AROON 5-minute was a little late to indicate bearish reversal but the overbought RSI coupled with breaking bearish on the 3-minute was a good indication. That and the consecutive black marabozu. 

Just put it this way. Unless we have great economic news that warrants a rally and there's no potential for bad news later in the day (today it was escalation of conflict in Syria and Xi's tariff announcement) then it's best to wait for that rally to show weakness and buy your puts.

Also keep in mind your just going to get out of the trade after one offsets the other with enough profit you are happy with..

  


Example :

  


buy SPY 266 call 1-2 years expiration

  


Buy SPY 262 put 6 months expiration.

  


And what do you think will happen if you wait just 1 month even??

1,2018-04-12,"Being cucked by beta is really quite simple. Volatility *greatly* affects long term returns. You want a reduced variation in your returns, (which requires less dispersion) leading to a smaller standard deviation which in turn leads to a more consistent growth rate. 


Look at the difference between the arithmetic mean return on the SPY and NASDAQ for about 50-100 years. The arithmetic mean return is greater on the NASDAQ (doesn’t account for compounding) BUT the **geometric** mean return is greater on the SPY. Therefore, based on the NASDAQ being more volatile your $$ would’ve grown at a higher rate simply holding SPY. The geometric mean return takes compounding into account, and factors in the volatility of your returns.


 Now, if you’re holding short term, then yeah the beta decay isn’t a huge issue. The beta decay occurs simply when the underlying goes down by x, and your leveraged ETF goes down by (x • factor of leverage). Due to beta, the leveraged ETF is x times riskier than just holding the underlying. In order to make back a 50% loss, you need a 100% gain. 


(Ex. Start w/ $100, lose 50% you’re at $50. Need to gain 100% to get back to initial investment. If you calculated your **arithmetic** mean rate of return for these 2 periods, you’d get (-50+100)/2= 25%. Obviously that makes 0 sense, since your actual rate of return was 0%. This is why the **geometric average** that takes compounding into account gives you the true return based on compounding (0.50•2.00)^(1/2) - 1 = 0% which is your true return). This is a small example of what can happen due to beta decay (taking on x # of units more of risk than the underlying).


 Don’t get me wrong though, there is $$ to made on leveraged ETFs, but it is **terrible** for the long term.",WSEnthusiast,wallstreetbets,1.0

Buy a few longterm Calls and/or Puts like 30-80 days expiration.

0-day options or 1-7 day options. You just buy calls after Big Red days/dips, and then slowly add Puts at each mountain top. You have to guess the mountain tops of course, but you'll eventually learn to wait and stop the emotional connection. 

example, today I bought  SPY  265 puts and 268 puts. I unfortunately just sold them too early, but they profited none-the-less. I still have a couple open right now.

I see that there are way too many puts, so obviously until it forces most of those closed, the market won't go down.

and while this kinda runs up, my longterm Calls are gaining some. etc. I may close the Long term calls when they profit some and then just re open some long term calls after another dip etc.. over and over again making one long perpetual trade that almost never ends..

Just a line chart.

1. It either rallied or dipped. 
-You buy Calls after drops, and Puts after Mountains. Sell within minutes or atleast until some profit. 

2. Meanwhile have longer plays going on in the background, like 30-80 days expiring options at otm strikes incase Big rallies or dips.

So you just fight Algos all day and force funny shapes on the chart because of the Computers need to push you out. 

3a. then, on top of that, you have the futures helping you in whichever direction you need help with. 

4b. Then if you want to get deeper, you would buy actual shares of Spy/QQQ / TQQQ to actually force real profit/loss in whatever direction you need as well.

5.c Oh and I will never get into this, but I guess you would use the final level of selling calls/puts too. But I know it's so manipulated so I prefer just buying calls/puts as then you only lose how much you paid initially.

39,2018-04-11,"Yes, Because I'll drop the one with the most profit and then either open a new call/future foothold, while the market has to pullback a little, and if it doesn't, I'll continue making gains, because when I close the ones with profit, I start a new set of Puts and calls accordingly.

Meanwhile I have way out of the money calls/puts gaining/losing as well, but eventually the long term ones will offset each other and once the market decides if it wants to tank or rally like no other, those will overturn any losses I have short term etc..

Abathor: regress(MU, SPY, SPY - XLK)!",2yan,wallstreetbets,53.0
54,2018-04-11,"I'm a little confused about this section

&gt;
The beta (basically just the slope of the regression line), actually includes r-squared in that beta = r *(s_y / s_x). So, in this case, since we know that r is roughly 0.45 and beta is 1.7, the variance of MU is 16x the variance of SPY in your sample, which is what's driving the slope.

I' m just going to word my understanding bit by bit to make sure I've got it right

&gt;The slope includes r^2  in that


&gt;B = r(standard_devation_of_y/standard_devation_of_x)

All good so far. 

&gt; The variance of MU is 16x the variance of spy

1.7 = .45 * s_y/s_x

1.7/.45 = s_y/s_x

3.77 = s_y/s_x

I might need a little more explanation on how we got the 16x the variance. 

&gt; Which is what's driving the slope.

How did we conclude that the difference in variance is driving the slope?  There seems to be a bit of a jump there. I'm not saying you're jumping to conclusions, I'm saying you know more than I do and I might need that omission explained a little bit. 

Also notes My first thoughts to correct this would be to divide both by the standard deviation... although for that to work I would be assuming that the percentage changes in each are normally distributed and I guess Jarque-Bera might disagree.

&gt; you can still perform a rank-based test for correlation between the two variables using Spearman's rho to control for outliers which may be informative, or you can augment your hypothesis by adding MU-related factors to your model to improve your residuals.

Adding a spearman rank to the bot would be pretty cool, I will def do that. 

In terms of adding more factors, a lot of factors are correlated to the market and that makes it harder to add more and still maintain interpretive power . I added the ability to subtract in the bot so that I can take *differences from the market* as an input,
so basically the bot can do this, Abathor: regress(MU, SPY, SPY-XLK)! I was just wondering if that's a good way to deal with this problem.

Edit:I guess it can't do the subtraction,  I need to figure out whatever is causing that bug, I'll do that when I get home to the server.

63,2018-04-11,"The test for the coefficient is for whether it is different from 0, so statistical significance only implies that the two variables are not mutually independent. The strength of the relationship is typically measured by the correlation coefficient i.e. whether the direction of the move in one variable matches the direction of the move in the other variable. The beta (basically just the slope of the regression line), actually includes r-squared in that beta = r *(s_y / s_x). So, in this case, since we know that r is roughly 0.45 and beta is 1.7, the variance of MU is 16x the variance of SPY in your sample, which is what's driving the slope. This would not give me a great level of confidence for trading MU based on signals about SPY, because you will often end up on the wrong side of the trade.

There are two things to consider - you can still perform a rank-based test for correlation between the two variables using Spearman's rho to control for outliers which may be informative, or you can augment your hypothesis by adding MU-related factors to your model to improve your residuals.

A move of  1% in spy leads to a move of 1.7 % in MU normally.  +- 19.7%. But that *only* explains 23.5 % of Mu's move there could be a bunch of other reasons that it's moving in different directions.

This number is really tiny which is good. If it is over 0.05 Ignore the whole damn thing. Literally. Just don't look at anything in the results, it's all nonsense. 



Adj. R-squared [0.438]
-  approx 44 % of apples movement can be explained by this regression.

________________

Table 2: 

Look at the column P&gt;!t!

Notice that the const row has a p greater than 0.05. Just completely ignore that row.

Now look at the X1 row in table 2, it's got a significant P value (It's less than 0.05). 

In this output each variable you add is called X1, X2, X3 etc. 

So if I had run the command as follows (AAPL, SPY, AMD, MU)
I would be looking at the impact of SPY, AMD, and MU on AAPL.
So table 2 would have the rows: Const, X1, X2, X3

Where X1 is SPY, X2 is AMD etc. 

The coef column tells you a change of 1 in SPY results in how much of a change in AAPL. 

So in this case, when the market goes up by 1, we would expect apple to go up by 1.17, and when the market goes down by 1 we would expect AAPL to go down by 1.17.

27,2018-05-01,"Let it ride. I'm assuming this is SPY. It may recoup some value if next week is a good week, which I think it will be.

Next time don't YOLO your account on options. It seems easy to make money but it's easier to lose it. 

It's easy to see people here shoe their gains and want in but you will lose 8/10 times. Do some research, come up with strategies you think might work based on your analysis and then bet. And never more then like 10% of your account. You are better off to save money until you have a sizeable amount. 

It is easier to learn the hard way with a few thousand then find out down the road with 10x that. Everyone makes the same mistakes when they start. Win big first time or 3 and then you get fucked. 

And never play with money you can't afford to lose.",frigsakesstu,wallstreetbets,27.0
28,2018-05-01,"You keep talking about dollar amounts then switching to percent.... if you made $400 in a few minutes off of investing $100 into options that's one thing, but if you put $2k in and made $400 that's different (one great one good, but for reference it helps).

Also you put 5/4 270.5 calls... is this for SPY?

My advice is to learn from your mistakes.  Don't put more than you can accept to risk into a single transaction.  Sure you limit your gain potential, but you also limit your lose.  Don't keep throwing money at a loser... once it became clear it wouldn't happen you should've stopped ""averaging down"" (which only works if you have more and more money to play with PLUS you think the position will pay off before expiration).  Actually you could probably have bought some puts instead and maybe averaged out flat/low loss.  Don't think ""every time will be a winner"" because if you're hitting 50/50 or slightly better my guess is you're slightly above average for an ""at home"" investor.  Also buy ITM calls, don't screw around with OTM especially with a low account balance where a single option contract can make/break you.  Also maybe it's time to consider paper trading until you have ""your plan"" figured out.

Or just dump in $200 and then bet yet again on SPY or QQQ going the way you want and will have big movements.  Repeat 2-3x and if you win each time you'll be back at $2k in no time.  *Don't do this*

0,2018-05-04,"List some of your trades/strike/options plays and we can tell you why you shouldn't have done that and maybe try to see why you lost all that.

I should know something by now as I've lost $16,000-20,000 now.. But I'm still fine and recently have been changing some of my ways of trading and it's working (as you'll see in my recent posts)

I know now to wait for opportunities instead of trying to fight to force them..   Yesterday we had a huge run down of 400 points on the Dow, then quickly all the way back up. 

That was one of the opportunities to wait for. I only caught some of it, but if it tries to do that again, I'm going full tilt on a 0-day option play If I see that again.  but in general you have to be watching the market 24-7, which I am lucky enough to be able to do.

Since most people can't watch the market 24-7, I am no expert by any means, but having now seen what kinda happens over time, I would wait till you hear about some huge red down day and ""the dow is down 400 points"" on the news, and buy as many shares as you can in a ETF Index fund.

and let is sit then. check it periodically.

If you do have time to check it more often and want to trade more often, then perhaps try buying 1 week options on $SPY, $QQQ etc, and only after you see/hear about a big dip/drop or terrible day in the market.

You would buy right after you think the dip/drop is at the bottom and or at 3:55pm if you see the market is down alot. Then buy the 1 week option and close it within the next day or within 2-3 days if you think it will continue up.


*side note- it's probably better to buy longer than 1-week options for you, maybe like 2 weeks - 1 month long expiring options. But key is to buy them after big drops or run-ups.  You need to purchase options when premiums are trying to adjust to whatever just happened. 

Also to me, it's preferable to close options more quickly then letting them run, so if you see profit that you are happy with, or even 10-30% up, I'd go ahead and close it. Because the market is there to screw you, not give you free money, remember that, it's a business and they want money, your money.

Of course I didn't but as you know I actually followed my rules and bought after a big red day/dip which is All I blab about constantly to you all here.. So I just did it and it worked this time. 

But I also thought there is no way this is going to go off a cliff and totally crash because nobody was panicking on the news, CNBC said nothing except ""oh the dow is down 400 points""... and I thought to myself, well our leader isn't going to let a crash happen under his ""win"" strategy and making America better isn't having a crash in the stock market.. and things like that. 

I also thought maybe they are just as I always say ""manipulating"" the market so they can 1. take out all long calls, and 2. prepare for the buybacks maybe?

$TSLA is possibly my favorite stock to trade because it actually moves enough that you have a reasonable chance of making money in both directions.

I think there's a decent shot at $TSLA returning to $300+ once the analysts get over their hurt feelings, since the earnings release was pretty good, overall.

10,2018-05-05,"&gt;what if it dropped a dollar, do you lose more than double your money?

No that's the nice thing. You just don't sell the contract and you lose the money you paid for it.

I only got into this stuff a couple weeks ago. I've just been reading and absorbing everything possible. I made a couple bets on Apple calls that worked out so that was encouraging. But, standalone calls and puts are not good options trading strategies. They're more like gambling than investing.

You can limit your downside by looking up how to make option spreads and covered calls/puts. 

Since you can buy AND sell options, there is no ""house advantage"" like with a Casino. Especially because RH charges no commission. So in theory you can exploit an edge and make money. You just need to find the edge. I'm starting to think that keeping things simple is better. I hate Snapchat, I think they suck. So long-term puts seem like a good idea. I just need to find the right strike price. 

In the long run, can you beat straight investments into $SPY? Maybe, maybe not, but it's certainly more fun than passive investing.

As the other people said - find a cheap stock that you feel good about and buy a contract. Snapchat again. Only $10/share. So a good entry point for me would be to buy a single contract on a put which would only be a few dollars. Use that as a starting point.",kroatone,wallstreetbets,10.0

They made it look like it was gonna go up, but look, it's now back down and It's better to buy as they lower it more. 

I""m talking about from 9:15pm - 10:18pm futures on sunday.

anyway, buy 1 call either in-the-money, at-the-money, or out-of-the-money for 7-14 days.  

then slowly add 1 more call if they drop it down $1.. then add one more call if they drop it another $1..

etc. like that. 

Then just wait a few days or even till end of day and you'll profit. They aren't taking it back down to $258 again, not till some crazy news comes out. 

I guess the worst I can see is $260 lowest. ($SPY)

And if it head anywhere near there, I've got $24,000 cash sitting waiting, and that's not including margin, to go all-in calls on $SPY (or fricken $SPX)

Yeah, I mean if SPY continues to go up throughout the week it'll work. If it doesn't then no it probably won't work lol. Kind of binary there.

9,2018-05-06,"It sound like you need to take the safest route.

Watch the market around 9:27am. See where $SPY (or apparently we are supposed to use $SPX), is at.  

Then if you get the feeling, buy 1 call at 930am strike $263 or lower if you want to be the absolute safest. 

then wait 2 minutes or 5 minutes and see if they start to drop it. IF you notice minimal dropping, don't do anything, if you feel it starts dropping to 265, 264, 263, then buy 1 call again at each of the drops..  

until you amass 3-4 calls.   

I suggest you do 7 days out, if you have enough money do the 10-14 days out then those are really playing it safe and can ""save"" you if we have a downturn. (which again, why would they drop it down when we just had Apple fly up, we already had a down-turn, and now more earnings coming up etc.) Remember that we had lows on thursday and people want to make money and want in, so there is no real good reason for more down-turn.

If you want to really  gamble and pay less, (but now you are really really gambling) use 5-7 days out expiration.

Make sense?

I think you'll want to try it with $SPY because it's cheaper and maybe will fill quicker.  

Oh also I use thinkorswim which allows you to click very fast in and out too though. So that might be a big factor on buying and selling quickly and at better prices..

Also, the roll and beta decay is NOT fixed at that rate, it is nonlinear and variable. The former depends on the contango the latter depends on the leverage factor and the volatility squared.


My point is that your suggestion to buy when below 7 is fucking retarded because the scale of the equity changes as a function of time due to both roll decay and beta decay.  The advice of ""buy under 7 and sell over 7"" is irrelevant a month from now.  If you made the same argument with pure VIX futures, e.g. ""buy below 15, sell above 15"", then it would make sense because the scale of the VIX just a function of SPY implied volalility, therefore temporally independent.

28,2018-05-09,"Good plan! I always hit a plateau in learning by reading or observing where the only way to break through is by just doing things even if I fuck up.

If you want to get your hands a bit dirty leveraging options for a basic volatility trading strategy:

* set aside an amount you are willing to lose and consider it tuition. 
* Open a robin hood account and transfer over your tuition
* get it approved for options, lie in response to all of the experience questions to ensure you get approved
* Buy a single SPY call and a single SPY put with the same strike price (feel free to keep some $$ in reserve)
* Chose an expiration date 1-3 months out, whichever fits in your tuition budget. 
* Watch and learn from how each leg responds to the market
* Sell either leg when it is profitable. 
* Average down either leg by buying more when it is down (deploy reserve $$ here)
* Repeat the last two steps


The primary risk to this strategy is value loss to time decay if the markets trade flat. Otherwise it is fairly hard to fuck up and you learn A LOT about how options respond to market forces.

18,2018-05-10,"It really depends.

Absolute best case the SPY goes up, or down 2+ points tomorrow.

If SPY can open within 0.5 of where it closed today, I have some calls that are green and I’ll sell those.

I think it’s going to drop.  A 2-3 point drop and my puts which are now varying shades of red will be very green and I’ll sell those.

If SPY continues on up another 2-3 points that’s OK too, I have some calls that will be more than green enough to offset my puts being garbage (which don’t expire for 2-4 weeks anyways so there’s a chance they may pay out in the end).

Worse case (for me) is the SPY never goes up or down more than 0.5 points.  But not terrible because all my SPY calls/puts expire out a few weeks at least.

Last week was my best trading week ever.  I did it by looking at stocks I felt had large upsides (looking at their P/E and 50/200 DMA) and bought calls on those and sold many of them within a few days for 50-200% gains *and* got many SPY call/put strategies (guesses) right.

1,2018-05-12,"I'm pretty sure you will lose it all if you keep waiting. But it's totally up to you, just don't let it get to you, remember that $2000 is nothing in the grand scheme of things, even if you are poor. You can always work somewhere and do something to make $2000.  

Remember that the biggest problem with losers is that they keep losing. Don't allow yourself to keep losing, I usually don't follow it anymore, but If I had a trade that started to lose over $100, I would usually drop it. Sometimes I would let it go to -$200 just to see if it would turn around, and it never would.  

there  was only one time I held a future at a loss of -$5000 and I was margin called and all this and that on it, and I held it overnight and it literally recovered the next day, only because of something that caused it to fly back up. Personally I think it was because they were trying to get me to close it out because come to think about it, it was way back right before some real serious rally days were about to start. 

anyway, point is, don't wait, and accept losses quickly and try again. 

I tried the same mentality of hoping it would recover when losing, and it made me lose thousands. I just recently tried to hold a $TVIX 2700 shares position I bought in around $6.. well look, its now at $5.60 or so and lost me $1400,  I decided to let it go and play up on $SPX with 3 options today which already got me back $360. (I also opened up 17 $SPY Calls because I was pissed about $TVIX dropping so hard) haha

on the example with the futures, remember with futures, like shares, you have no time decay or time limit, so that's why I can wait for that to recover. (except for margin requirements. etc)

So there is my story about holding too long and thinking it would work for me..

So now remember being short Apple isn't good if it doesn't go your way too soon, and the weird thing is that when you get out, Apple will drop more..

My good story on that was I tried $40,000 in Apple shares (with margin) and all the sudden I was down $-3000 or so in like 3-4 days..  

All I had to do was wait.. I was in at $149 or $156? somewhere around there. I closed it because it was $-4000 at one point or something.  

But when you are long shares, all you have to do is wait, but it's so boring. 

Calls and puts you're screwed with time.. 

But it's not worth shorting anything unless you got the bad news, or it's one of those red days that just keeps going into 4pm red.",GrapeJelly33,wallstreetbets,1.0

Then, a few years back, they spun off electronic measurements (a slow growth area) to pursue biotech and chemical analysis (the EM company they spun off is Keysight $KEYS). I haven’t heard a ton about them since, but they weren’t a company that was ever very explosive.

Do not do this Monday, you NEED to wait for the day we all drop big and you hear on CNBC about how the dow is down 400+ points etc..

On that day, or any day you read or see anywhere that some stock or the indexes dropped some huge amount, put $25,000 in shares into anything like TQQQ, SPY..

You can do options if you want but you'll need to make sure you have like 180 days till expiration.. And buy the strike just a little higher than the price the stock is currently at, like $1-5 higher strike.

  


But with shares you can just leave it there and watch as the market goes up towards the end of the year a ton and you profit, with options you will make more, but be getting hit with time decay if there is no movement or the stock goes down..

  


I guess you could look into buying like 200 vertical spread options on Apple or Google or Amazon or etc..

  


Check into that too.

  


Just go on YouTube and watch videos about vertical spreads

  


But don't jump in, if you have $50,000 just put it in something that you know will grow nonmatter what in 1 or 2 years the S&amp;P or Nasdaq will be soooo much higher than it is now so it might be worth you just putting it all in shares on TQQQ.

  


Look this stuff up before you jump on on Monday.. We have had 5+ days of going up, so there will be a red day soon, then you Want to jump in.

0,2018-06-02,"Probably just gonna sit pat with the calls I have currently. Picked up 6/29 MSFT calls at open today that are already up a good bit, and am bagholding some MU calls. Depending on how those go, I may roll them into more aggressive strikes, but other than that I don't see myself changing my positions substantially this week.

If I had enough uninvested funds to make plays this week, I'd probably go for SPY/QQQ puts through wednesday (market went up a ton today across the board, and I think we see a pullback, especially depending on the tariff bullshit that's afoot) or 8/17 V calls (not sure of the exact strike I'd do for that, but either 135 pr 130 looks solid to me, depending on your risk tolerance). V essentially broke even on a day the market went up a ton due to temporary factors, and I firmly believe it will make that up and more. Furthermore, they'll have their ER coming up sometime in July likely, and V historically wrecks those. 

Alternatively, if you're planning on holding off, I think long term SPY calls may reap some serious gains. We've been trading sideways at ~270 for nearly 5 months now despite great earnings and largely good market conditions. If tweetledumb will fucking forget about starting stupid ass trade wars with every country on the planet, I think there's a solid chance of a breakout to ~285 by the end of the summer, with an outside chance of hitting 300 by end of year. Now, just as a forewarning, I'm obviously pretty bullish, so don't just see those numbers and say ""fuck it, looks good to me"".

For examlme sometimes I have my $SPX calls making $200 or much more, and in that case, I can now open a put closer to the money, to capture more money if it drops..

You initially start with otm puts and as your calls make more money you can adjust or if you are sure about your feelings that the next crash will go to 270 ($SPY) then keep rolling the $270 puts, but you'll see as it happens because you'll have to adjust if we have a rally ..

You want to keep your puts so they make some money on drops.. so yes you'll have to adjust them higher as your calls make money..

29,2018-06-07,"I’m not trying to be overly harsh, I think you just need to have some perspective.  And I’m not basing this on “it happened in the past, AMD always goes up then crashes down” but just look at the recent run.

Personally I will only do *FD* type trades on QQQ or SPY unless I have reason to believe the stock I’m *betting* on is expected to have some sort of quick/large change.  For AMD people have been expecting a drop for weeks now just because it’s been on a run lately and a pullback of a few percent wouldn’t be out of the question, even if AMD is on its way to $20 in a few months which it very well might be.  That said if you really believe in something, buy some options a few months out that aren’t too expensive, that way a sizable drop in the interim won’t wreck you.  For instance I might consider some calls on AMD for their next ER (I think July timeframe) at $16 or so a decent deal right now.  $16 for next Friday would be what I call a gamble, which is fine, but very real chance it doesn’t pay off.",Gahvynn,wallstreetbets,29.0

You should first think about your risk tolerance, and my first question would be do you have a family. Being responsible for others will be a big factor in how much you can afford to yolo.

In the meantime if you want to somewhat join the fun I suggest starting off by putting half your money into index funds (SPY and QQQ) and the other half into no-brainier meme stocks like the FANG stocks, NVDA, MFST, MU, SQ and a sprinkling of other exciting stocks that you like the look of e.g. AMD, SHOP, EA, BABA, TCEHY, etc. *Don't dumpster drive for trash old man stocks like you are suggesting.* And stop looking at GE. You can then scale up or down your risk from there.

21,2018-06-09,"Even if you can pay outright, getting a loan is often a better plan. 

For example, near the end of 2016 my girlfriend at the time (now wife) bought a new car for 28k in cash when she could have taken a loan at like 1.3%. 

I thought she should take a loan for 2 reasons but this was before we were married and it was entirely her money so her decision

1. If she had put that money into SPY instead she would easily beat the APR so she is literally losing money by paying for it outright. She could have allowed that money to continue working for her at an avg return of 7-9% while paying 1.3%. 

2. The way I am I can easily adjust my budget to fit an additional payment and not have to dip into savings but I am much less likely to replace a large purchase from my savings at the same rate. So if I take on a $400/month payment it is much more likely I can reduce my frivolous spending to have that payment not effect what I'm saving. But it is much less likely that if I pay it outright from my savings that I will be able to replace it at the same rate as I would be paying the loan. Basically if I realize my bills are dipping into my savings I will cut back on all the money I waste on dumb shit but I'm less likely to cut back in order to save more then I already am.",poopDOLLLA,wallstreetbets,21.0

1,2018-06-12,"Ok, so $43 calls @ an avg cost of $1.14. I assume you bought these earlier today considering the mid is 1.15? Anyhow, I avoid buying naked calls and speculating purely on direction and mostly use high probability plays. 

That's why above I mentioned the volume profile since that pertains more to speculating on price movements, but I use it a bit differently. Anyhow, the delta of the call is 0.64, you can use that as a back of the envelope calculation for probability of ITM, so 64% ITM by expiration. That does **not** give you probability of profit, though. 

Your breakeven point is 43 + 1.14 = 44.14. Based on current IV of @ 17.88%, there is 38.08% chance that CSCO is above your breakeven by expiration. Obviously you could sell prior to expiration too. IV Rank is 16%, IV Percentile is 22%. So, you bought at a time where IV is lower and since you're long vega, this is good for you. 

CSCO's 3 month correlation to SPY is 0.8. So it's definitely strong, and when the market goes up, CSCO tends to go up with it more often than not. 

Again though, I don't know what % of your portfolio is in CSCO. Since we're on wsb, I'd probably say at least 25%. If that's the case, **definitely consider** selling OTM calls against the current calls you have now. This will 1) lower your cost basis and lower your max loss 2) limit your gains (yes I know, sad) 3) give you a higher probability of profit by moving your breakeven down. 

Say you sold the 44 call: you would lower your max loss to $590, and max gain to $410. Roughly a 59% probability of profit here. Your breakeven would now be $43.58, instead of 44.14. Also, a 51.11% chance the stock is above your breakeven @ expiration. Nice, right? You could sell further OTM too, which would result in a less minimized max loss, but a higher potential gain and higher breakeven than $43.58 @ expiration date. 

I don't trade CSCO often either, but to see any real gains it's probably got to break past the 44.5 area. Again though, I really avoid just buying naked calls on stocks and mostly make high probability plays. ",WSEnthusiast,wallstreetbets,1.0

33,2018-06-11,"The way I see it is there are people with millions of times the money that I have are trying to play the same game I am.  So I can try to make super gutsy QQQ/SPY/MU/whatever moves and maybe be right now and then, or I can play it safe and have conservative plays that are more geared towards the health of the business I am buying stocks/options for and have the expiration date be out weeks if not months and not trying to make bucks off of world news.

Personally I think the *market* assumes that USA will keep trading with its closest allies and congress will stop anything truly insane from happening.  So I don’t think the market will move at all based on the G7 show, or if it does I think SP500 drops more than 3%, so yes a drop but not *FUUUUUUUUCK MEEEE* kind of drop.  As for the NK summit I don’t think anyone thinks President Trump will get everything he wants, but probably some timeline for NK denuclearization and a timeline for inspections of the progress and a meeting down the road where some sort of treaty will be negotiated for removing sanctions from NK as long as the inspections are OK.  So if Trump walks out with a deal like I’ve mentioned, I do think the markets will react favorably, but short of armed conflict resuming in Korea I don’t think things will get too shitty.  If he walks out with everything he demanded going in, I think we might get one of the best up days/weeks for the SP500 has ever had *not* following a monster drop.

If the USA stops trading with its allies or there’s a trade war between USA and EU/Canada, the markets are going to absolutely shit the bed with SP500 moves rivaling what we saw in 2008, at least in the intraday.

9,2018-06-13,"SPY will probably end up sideways as the interest rate hike was already known about. Now it will pick more of a direction based upon the overall tone of the Fed and if there is indication of the number of future rate hikes/trade war commentary. 

 It depends on the bank for how it moves: short term hikes will increase their loan profitability and reserve value. It negatively impacts the number of loans potentially and their investment value. So overall hard to say, most likely a small increase. 

Credit card interest will go up as well, which should help their stock prices a little.

So if the market were rational, I would probably get slightly OTM calls on financials and ITM puts on SPY. 

However, it’s not rational and SPY could continue trending upward based upon more pressing trade war news and such and overall strong stock performance/earnings. Financials could also remain fairly unaffected. 

Overall I would say the tone of the policy statement and economic forecast is more important than the actual rate hike which was already know about. I would actually say given the economies growth and positive geopolitical news, this will end up positive for the market atleast beyond a quick knee jerk downturn. ",Chi3fSlapaho3,wallstreetbets,9.0

Now some are, they made some ballsy plays, made an amazing return once, maybe 4-5 times even, but that’s the exception, not the rule.  You don’t see the more depressing ones because for one there is a rule against glorifying losses, and two my guess is that some people probably stop posting after they’ve blown out their account.

I hope you turn your $11k into $100k and beyond.  I hope to read your “I just bought a mansion in LA/NYC/whatever expensive city you want” post.  But if all you’re doing is gambling, I would say &gt;50/50 that you’re going to a) stop posting or b) make a post like “I ran my account up to $24k, now I’m back down to $500, can anyone give me some YOLOs so I can get back up in three weeks”.

Don’t make any plays, hang tight, let this week play out (a lot of potential instability with big reports coming from the USA government) and come back ready to kick ass.

If you really want a gamble, get some 6/22/2018 SPY calls for $280 and set some limits so you're account will sell if it hits like 3 or 4x returns which it might, or it might go to zero.  You'll either come back with $30k, or nothing.",Gahvynn,wallstreetbets,20.0

If I just straight up short a bank stock and the bank share price halves, the return is nowhere near as good.  Of course if I had puts on that particular bank stock it would destroy the SPY gains.

20,2018-07-06,"Solid.  One further comment on this - usually when bear markets happen, there is a reason driving it.  In the dot com bubble, valuations got silly without assets or earnings to back them up, so they corrected hard.  In the 08 crash, leverage was too high and the housing crash made the leverage worse.  Financials took it on the chin for overextending.

Right now, the market is high and has been in solid bull territory for a long time.  But the only true foreseeable threat to continued growth is the trade war (or possibly a student loan crisis, but we are a long way away from that).  It may or may not happen and it may or may not have actual impact on the economy &amp; corporate earnings.  But right now it looks like earnings are strong enough to justify the prices we are seeing.  Sure, SPY has a high multiple right now, but tech is driving most of the market and many of the multiples there are actually reasonable.

1,2018-07-10,"When I first found out about shorting strangles, I also thought that things like an Iron Condor might be a better trade than a short strangle.

You are correct that say an Iron Condor or Fly or something uses less capital and has limited losses. One idea might be that you might just trade like 7 Iron Condors instead of shorting 1 strangle, however with the Iron Condor, the probability of you making money is less than the strangle and during most (but not ALL) market conditions, the long options of the Iron Condor and such are unnecessary. 

That isn't to say that shorting strangles are necessarily better than Iron Condors. Obviously if we get a big move or a flash crash, you could be boned very quickly in the strangle. At the end of the day, it depends on your personal risk tolerance and overall capital.

The guys at tastytrade do a much better job than I ever could of explaining this.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Klit1922n-Q

As for underlyings, I like to trade on indexes. It might just be me but I seem to get better fills on indexes like such as SPY.

Here is a link to a study on shorting strangles on TLT, apparently TLT also works either but I have never done it.

Another tip that I can gave is that you shouldn't short strangle just for the sake of shorting strangles. They don't always work and if you don't feel comfortable shorting strangles, it isn't worth trading them.

Plus, euro options are cash settled so you don't get as fucked when you lose as compared to getting settled on SPY.

If you want to trade a super liquid market, check out the /ES futures market. It's easy as fuck to make money on it as you can close any time compared to options which only trade during the market hours.

/ES and SPX offer the benefit of [60% long term / 40% short term capital gains](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1256), which roughly equals to paying ~19% tax (assuming you fall into the regular income bracket and not an exceptional case) on the gains. /ES has the benefit of being much easier to file on your as you only have to put in what you made or loss at the end of the year.

59,2018-07-10,"There are some merits to this strategy, but I would suggest that a better play is the ""Asian Tigers"" portfolio.  It's comprised only of larger cap tech stocks with CEOs that are either Asian, or named Tim Cook.

Here's the basket: AAPL, NVDA, GOOGL, BABA, AVGO, MSFT, ADBE, AMD

EDIT:  My original post was obviously in jest, but now that I am thinking about it, I think I need to roll this Asian Tigers portfolio out as a tracker ETF.  This portfolio would absolutely obliterate the broader market.  I bet the 5-10 year historic performance of this basket outperforms QQQ and SPY by a preposterous margin.

EDIT 2: For any curious minds, below is how the Asian Tigers portfolio performs against QQQ and SPY.  Surprisingly, in many cases, this portfolio even has higher Sharpe and Sortino ratios than QQQ and SPY.  All percentages are CAGR (annualized returns).

14,2018-07-11,"Hi guys, I'm a dividend investor who got into option last 2 months. And I wanted to share my story and lesson I learned.

I've been investing in dividend stocks past 3 years. Literally bought dividend stocks when it dipped. And never bought high flyers like Amazon, Google, Facebook, Netflix or you name it.

Anyways, 2 months, I got a notification from RH that I now qualified for option trading. I knew what that was but not really interested. I knew that wasn't for me and I liked to stick with what I know. That's good thing right? Well no.. I was going heavy on margin at that time. I bought huge amount of shares of $WBA with margin. Unfortunately, the stock was keep going down fast and deeper where I ran out of money completely and hoping it was going up one day.

$WBA seemed to go nowhere and was draining RH gold so I had to do something. So I margin more! (What an idiot right? ) to do options. (When I think about it now, I was really dumb but really lucky) I was lucky for one month where I made more than what I lost on $WBA. So I sold pretty much all of $WBA positions(still have 60 shares) with some loss (3k) And was going hard with options with heeeeeavy margin.(\~$80,000 margin) Thinking I was smart dude up until I got so close to get margin call following week. I bought $SPY option calls and the market crashed next few days with trade war news. I kept average down my calls but I was inch close to get margin call. I was down 30k. That was 1/3 of my portfolio. I was panicking and hopeless and wishing just go back up. I wanted to sold everything but my gut told me not to..

Thankfully, the market went up crazy and made all back.. Pure luck. I made more than where I started and made \~25k in 2 months. I don't know how to be honest with you..

Anyways, after riding that sickening roller coaster, I decided not to play with fire (options). I'm completely out of option and allocated 25k into dividend stocks like JNJ, PEP, DIS, MMM, etc. I will stick with what I know the best.

Here's the life lessons I learned.

1. Try not to use margin (If you use more that what you are capable of, you are in big trouble. You don't want to put in yourself in danger of margin calls. It's scary and you have to pay them back! Plus, RH gold/month)
2. Play option only if you are good. 90&amp;#37; of day trader lose money in option so if you are noob, stay away
3. Don't show off or think you are master of option. Like I said above, even day trader lose money so be humble if you make money
4. Set a target and don't be greedy. Profit is profit. Okay? Don't be greedy where you lose all of it or get less

Let me know if you guys need help on dividend investing.

I actually haven't done many iron condors outright, but sometimes I'll sell a put spread and when the stock goes up I'll sell a similar expiration call spread, which is effectively an iron condor with the put and call legs opened at different times.

EDIT: Another good option would be SPY or other index funds. Especially now where we've been trading in a range. If I wanted to trade iron condors, I might open them up and then try to be patient and sell more call spreads when the index goes up, or try to sell put spreads when the index goes down.

It's an ETF that follows the performance of the S&amp;P500 index. Get to know that chart, and that chart alone. Don't bounce around trying to find 'deals' or the next big short or whatever. Looking to get rich quick will end badly. While your money is sitting in the SPY, read up on options, watch some youtube tutorials,  learn the Greeks, maybe paper trade a bit.  Once you feel confident, start buying some SPY contracts (one at a time) and get a feel for how those work. That's how you turn $500 into thousands.  Trust yourself. Don't let people on the internet make financial decisions for you.

Also - you'll eventually benefit from using a more robust trading platform.  Look up Thinkorswim.  You get it when you open an account with TDA. Learn technical analysis.

only problem is if you fuck up and break your rules... which i have a tendency to do. i've been burned twice because I tried to enter a trade around lunch time, or held too long and got into lunch time weirdness where volume falls off and then you're kinda in a bad spot since the lower volume makes the volatility a little worse, and you can suddenly find yourself pretty negative on that trade if it was already a little down before lunch time. i don't like to hold those trades overnight because I'm always using the expirations that are like, 4 days left because they are super cheap and I'm only look for SPY to move like, 10-20 cents, so i only need about an hour at most if I've picked a decent entry.

I was really skeptical when somebody posted a link to his stream a good while back just because of how much bullshit there is about trading online, especially shit like twitch and youtube. all these guys who claim to be awesome day traders... i was expecting to see some kid just goofing off on stream, meme'ing, or trying to sell me some book or class or something, but after watching him a bit when it was free, I have to say that it's effective guidance for people who are trying to day trade something like SPY or SPX. he does pretty much the same thing I've been doing, and I took some of the same trades as he was and people in chat were a few times, and they were great. the mentality of taking profits early is everything when you trade like that though. don't worry about what could happen later today, and certainly not tomorrow... just focus on a good entry point and nothing else matters. then take profits at like, 8% and you're golden. have stops set. easy game.

27,2018-08-04,"I never said they wouldn’t reach $1T. In fact, I was almost certain they would following earnings. It’s not like they had far to go from 0.96T and investors are getting confident again. If you had Apple calls then good on you, I hope you made a lot of money. You might want to consider selling soon. You took decent risk and got paid for it, that’s how the market is supposed to work. As for my call, I told you exactly when the Nasdaq was going to fall, and it did, immediately after my comment. I brought my high risk account up 72% in 3 days when I closed my QQQ and SPY puts around noon on Tuesday, and I’ve been all cash since then. I clearly saw that the move lower was losing steam on Tuesday and I got out. 

Downside moves don’t happen often, but when they do they are large and swift, just like the recoveries which follow (see: fri, mon, thurs, fri). 

I will concede that the past 2 weeks, 2800 has been the strongest and most consistent support I have seen on SPX all year. I wasn’t expecting that at all. Every single time we hit it or futures dipped below, SPX snapped back to 28xx like a rubber band. It provided a lot of great opportunities for dip buyers. Good for them, that is not how I invest. 

I’ll let spx head to 2873 (all time high) again before I build up short positions, at this point it pretty much feels like it’s inevitable. If you want to take the risk and keep buying calls in the single most overbought market in history, during what has become the second longest bull market in history, after the inflation-adjusted return on the Nasdaq just eclipsed the dot-com bubble, then go for it. Most people buying equities now have no perspective at all and just don’t know what the fuck they’re buying, but if you understand al this and still want to keep buying calls then good for you, you’ve got balls of steel. History has shown that returns to the upside right before bubbles burst can be phenomenal (see: Jan 2018, 1999/2000, early 1987 before Oct.)

That being said, we will see a recession in FY19. Maybe we can push it to 2020 but I really fucking doubt it. I think sept of this year will make it a little more obvious where we are headed. It may very well be the start of the bloodbath, or we’ll pass by the 10yr anniversary of the largest global financial crisis in history as the yield curve is inverting again without so much as a hiccup. Yield curve inversion is still set to occur by October. 

That said, until we get complacent enough to hit all time highs again on SPX, it’s a green light for the bulls and good luck to you with your calls. If you play it right you’ll be able to make a lot of money. Just make sure you factor in the possibility of an overnight -10 to 20% move when you are buying calls and determining your risk profile, otherwise you could get destroyed in a 1987 situation. Risk management from this point onward will separate the wheat from the chaff and determine future returns.",dylanx300,wallstreetbets,27.0

12,2018-08-05,"I was talking about UVXY specifically, but it's broadly true for cash-settled in general. In most cases it doesn't matter that much. 

SPY is an etf, and thus options shares-settled and American style. SPX is an index, and thus options are cash-settled and European style. But they track pretty closely. That's because it's never advantageous to exercise ahead of time. 

With a VIX (or derivative thereof) option, it's different. VIX spikes don't last and everyone knows it. They are priced for the expectation at expiration, which means that during a spike a longer-dated option can be seen to have a **negative** intrinsic value. This is very disappointing to naive people who were so sure they found a sure thing.

People only think his returns are bad because we park a couple thousand in SPY or VOO and think all investment is that easy. It’s not that easy. It’s easy for us to sit on 50% yearly gains in our 1k Robinhood accounts, but getting returns from commercial real estate with hundreds of millions in play is a challenge that most of us can’t comprehend. The challenge scales up exponentially once the market value moves into significant millions, and the illiquidity of real estate combines to make it as difficult as trying to drift race through the streets of Tokyo in a battleship.

Plenty of really rich people underperform the market because they either invest really defensively or they have a belief that their other vehicles will outpace the S&amp;P or the bond market, and they end up being wrong for any number of good or bad reasons. Everyone thinks they know exactly how to crush it with a fund that size but managing that much money is a lot harder than people seem to think. You can't just throw it into SPY and check back later, funds that size just don't work that way.

So for example, if investors holding SPY are not sweating any unknowns in the coming market, they may only be willing to spend .50 to protect a position slightly OTM. But if suddenly they’re fearful because “sounding” is becoming popular and that may hurt the markets, then maybe they are willing to pay $2.00 for that same slightly OTM contract.

I would recommend shorting SPY if this is what you want to do. Get short SPY with deep ITM puts on the long term. So like a LEAP 2020 $400 put, which has a high chance of finding a point where you will be profitable, but requires more than 10k to buy 1 put.",DownvoteToKarmaHell,wallstreetbets,27.0

I’m 20 right now. I’d love to retire between 35-45 if I had $400k right now. So assuming that I had that extra 400k right now, and put it in SPY, it’s not too outlandish to think that it would be up well over 75% by the time I’m 40. The catch is that I have to wait 20 years, instead of having 75% overnight. Will there be a correction? Sure, probably. There was one in 2003, 2008, and 2015. Short term doesn’t matter, because theoretically I would just ignore it. I could retire with well over 1.5M in just mildly liquid assets if that were the case, effectively doubling the default retirement fund I would have by that age anyway, assuming I contribute 12% and employer matches 6%.

6,2018-09-03,"It was pretty funny. I got out around 2007. My only big hit was Blackberry (fuck you).

  
The thing with options is, they're priced pretty perfectly. So you'd have to be right on the time frame, direction, and strike. 

I think if you want to take advantage of a potential downturn and are expecting it within the year, I'd say pick w.e you're willing to gamble to zero for this time frame and then either do debit spreads at strategic price points for whatever time frame. What I use are implied volatility lines.  I do this to sell puts and covered calls on my positions so its a little different, but you can definitely do the same.

with these points you can never be 100% so you do a range.

For example:

SPY @290, might have an IV point at 295, so you'd go 294 to 296 bear call spread. Or, on the Put side you might do half way between 290 and the next IV price range to the downside, which may be 285. So you'd do a 287/286 put spread. 

&amp;#x200B;

If that stock rallies, then you pick your next point.  and so forth. 

I prefer to use ATM spreads.  So I'd do a 290/289 spread or something like that. If that doesn't work then i'd go to the next one  at 291/290 and so forth, until you reach w.e position size you've determined is your maximum risk. You'd have to figure the system out yourself whether you wan to hold until expiration or close at X% of loss or profit.

4,2018-09-03,"I use DEGIRO.   
&gt; DEGIRO has, apart from shares, 3 types of instruments which will be useful to you. Leveraged products, warrants, and CFDs.
In all 3 cases the instrument value is determined by the price of the underlying, and in the case of warrants and lev prods, is leveraged.
CFDs are a 1to1 representation of shares, except that you can get higher margin on them through the broker, and they trade on European exchanges, so theyre cheaper to trade vis-à-vis normal shares. You can only short CFDs, and not buy them.
Leveraged products (generally issued by European banks like Vontobel and ING) and warrants have a different quirk. Theres a knock out, or barrier price, where in if that price is breached by the underlying, the instrument becomes worthless. Kind of like a built in break even price. I.e. a put on SPY with a barrier of 300 would've become worthless today.
Apart from that, Lev prods are like european options on crack, with leverage of 10-1 (usually stated on the trading platform). I have not sat down and done the math on how the price is influenced by the leverage, but generally the instrument (Lev prod., not warrants) movements are extreme, i.e. 600% movement for the instrument which was near the barrier price for a 35 point drop (-1,22%) in the S&amp;P as reference. Stupid games and stupid prizes.
Warrants are like shares on speed (and also have the same knock out barrier concept), with far out knock out prices (20% away from current stock price) you can have a 30% return for a 5% movement in the underlying, and with ATM knock outs, 400% returns for a 10% movement in the underlying.
Lastly, these instruments are a better deal than options on US markets, mainly cause theres no Theta or Vega risk. But I guess the returns are also slightly lower, especially in day trading.
Commissions: 4euro/trade on lev prods., 2euro/trade on warrants. Dont know about shares, but easy to find out on their website.

&amp;#x200B;

I still come back to this sub every once in a while, but using Robinhood, with a bit of margin, to hold NVDA, AMD, MSFT, and AMZN for roughly the last year and a half has proven to be the best strategy for me, by far.

In general for MU

SPY/QQQ drops = 2% drop

MU downgrade = 5% drop

Sector downgrade = 3% drop

Chinese tariff news = 3% drop (even if it’s old news being reiterated)

Good news about/for MU = 1% gain

If *nothing* else happens following these movements MU will rebound 1-2% after a few days.  Problem is we’ve been getting these downgrades and news events nearly weekly so as soon as MU starts moving positively it gets whacked again.  So really MU being down 2.3% based on memory getting a downgrade for WDC is actually a pretty good combination of sector downgrade plus good news about MU.  I still think $51.50 for today is likely (2% drop from Friday close) and then a slow rise back to $52.50 for Friday absent of any other bad news.

Is there a margin fee table? If you borrow at this range, your fee will be X. If you borrow at another range, your fee will be Y.

42,2018-09-06,"1.	Actually do research. Sometimes this is easy because you might know something about a company if you work in its industry. 
2.	P/E should be positive, or have a damn good reason not to be. (Early stage startup, low cap, growth burn’
3.	P/E should be reasonably lowish for its age and growth potential (Compare AAPL to AMZN. These are established companies. Is the growth potential accurately reflected in PE?)
4.	Momentum
5.	Fundamentals on the specific contract are important. RH makes it easy to buy contracts with 0 active interest. Aim for around 3 month term, and as deep ITM as reasonable for Delta and Theta.

45,2018-09-06,"Hopefully you get some real responses here, but to give you an idea how I handle those scenarios (active options account has a balance of 100-250k at all times--depending how lucky/raped I got for the month). 

For starters, take that last 25k and just take a fucking break. Back yourself out of the markets for a few days/weeks. Re-adjust and re-align. Try and actually learn something. 25k is still plenty to make back some serious gains. I put ~25k into a UTMA account for my toddler nephew and it has been as low as ~12k and as high as 41k (it currently sits at 35k). 

1: Well, if I were average WSB'er with $200 RH account I'd let it ride. When I have something like $20k of ATVI verticals or $11k of SPY weeklies that expire in 48 hours, I definitely start to leg out and minimize exposure/lock gains. It is also much easier to sell into strength. My best weeks have been stacking a bunch of 10-30% winners and not looking back. My worst weeks have been gambling on ER yolo's with way too much money, and then losing sight of everything. Keep the risk/reward and overall exposure in mind, and try to go a little longer on your expirations. As of right now, the majority of my holdings are Oct-Dec expirations. Anything I open up now is Nov/Dec at earliest. Yeah it is ""more expensive"" but it is hard enough to get the direction right, let alone direction+tiny timing window+chance to recover from bullshit FUD. 

2: I normally try to leg in (or do more advanced options trades like verticals, condors, spreads, etc). For instance, today I bought SPY 290C (9/7 Expiry) and the first 100 contracts were [purchased at 0.52](https://imgur.com/a/QBTFmuf) which soon after kept falling down to ~0.34ish. I still liked the trade and realize after many years of doing this that you will rarely make a ""perfect"" entry/exit so I [added 200 more contracts again at 0.34 range](https://imgur.com/a/QBTFmuf). At this point, had they fallen to 0.20ish I would have probably exited and walked away from that trade. However, it turned out to be a good little intraday swing and I walked myself out at 0.44-0.51 and now I have 25 free contracts riding and absolutely 0 worry (even if they go to 0, still a profitable trade). 

3: When this happens (which actually just recently happened to me on a bull call spread/vertical) I use it as an opportunity to either close out the short side of the spread or add and lopside the long side--assuming the technicals of the trade are still on. 

4: This sub isn't the right place for it, but I simply wouldn't do this. It's too much bullshit stress and not worth it. If you are 23 years old and your life savings is $5-10k then fuck it, why not? You can make that back easily. If you are talking a more serious amount of cash it just simply is not a good risk/reward trade-off. It is just like playing roulette. You'll walk up and slap $10k down on black 8 only to see it fall right next door and then as you walk away from the table the very next number hit is black 8. Markets will fuck with you the same way. Watch your SPY 290 FD's expire worthless Friday only to see a 2% market gap Monday.  ",usmc35,wallstreetbets,45.0

CAT is a trade war play. Everyone knows Canada will make a deal.

TSLA is going to have a great Q3. It sold off too fast. Going higher.

AMD keeps having good news, and if you watch the level 2, there was a pretty good fight around $32, but bulls won in the end. I can easily see $35 if not $40 by the end of October.

LULU has been trading sideways until it suddenly spiked so IDK. Looking at today tho, I might keep my eyes on it for a day trade.

cat had a good day and week, but is this the peak? I'm hesitant to jump in at this high of a price.

If she goes up by 5%, you’re now down 15 dollars in that position. Your bet is saying that spy would go up more, say 7% so you’re up 21 dollars there. This gives you a net gain of $6

It's often wider than 10x SPY, but consider that you're paying less commissions and other fees as well as the tax benefits. It's usually better to trade SPX over SPY if your trade size makes sense.

2,2018-10-05,"If you are opening 10K positions you should not be buying them on SPY. Use SPX. If you are on robinhood and dont have access to SPX, change brokers and pay commission because it is worth it. 

SPY gains are taxed as 100% short term capital gains aka regular income. 

SPX is taxed 60% long term, 40% short term. 

If you are making any kind of money trading the indexes this equals a huge difference on your taxes. 

If you are trading 10 contracts or more of SPY at a time there is literally no reason you shouldnt be trading SPX (10 SPY options = 1 SPX option of the equivalent strike/expiration) and you are giving the government more tax money for absolutely no reason",poopDOLLLA,wallstreetbets,2.0

10,2018-10-04,"Well, it'll probably go down more. So, interest rates went up 0.2% on the T-Bills. This has a lot of implications: (queue ""the implications"" from it's always sunny)

1. The only entity with the weight to move rates that much (a HUGE change) is China. China might be using their $1.1T in USA debt as a tool to put pressure on the USA to release tariffs. It's really their best tool to do this. This means there will likely be more sharp increases soon. It would make sense for them to do this before and into the midterms as it would likely benefit China indirectly to switch the power of government. 
2. This reduces the value substantially of corporate debt across the board. After all, why would you buy Apple bonds at 4% when you can get T-bills for 3.25%. Many companies have been extensively borrowing money to buy back stock, and this means all that debt is going to be more expensive resulting in reduced buybacks, less profitability, and potentially some credit crunches. After all, corporate debt is at an all time high.

So, I just bought a bear butterfly today on SPY. 50-&gt;100-&gt;50 contracts 288-&gt;278-&gt;270 strikes expiring at the end of the month. If I'm right, this will make me at least another $25k. ",SvenTropics,wallstreetbets,10.0

The majority of price action is retail investors fucking around.  Tomorrow bond desks will open up and yields will need to factor in the weekends Asian market changes and today's changes.  Likely we will see a rotation into bonds tomorrow dragging the yield all the way back to 3 and the market will slump accordingly.  I don't believe we are about to transition into a full bear market yet unless we see yields spike heavily at open, like upwards of 3.5% on the 10 yr.  This should send a shockwave of selling into the larger indices.  Spy puts will cover rate increases and the market just going down in general   TLT always inverses the rate, so buy calls if you believe that the market will continue the down trend tomorrow with a rotation into bonds.  If you want a more market neutral approach that expects volatility then buy spy calls and iwm puts.  Iwm has been dramatically underperforming spy so far.

Now for the risk to reward part. What’s your stop loss? When are you going to take profit? What if SPY opens at 278 tomorrow? Are you going to buy near resistance and risk your position in hopes for it to hit 281? 

If it opens 275 tomorrow, then you will have a better risk to reward if you buy calls right at open.

If you were to enter a position tomorrow, get out at the end of day no matter what. Any rallies are short term right now and is really risky to trade.

25,2018-10-12,"first short term trend change indicator for me was the russellsmall cap shitshow for almost two weeks...its been tanking first for a while...figured it was just basic profit taking at first since it has a lot of gains this year over SPY but it turned into a rout with zero bounce back

last week sell off in main indices like qqq and spy finally showed up and that also didnt get bounced...1st line of defense is usually the 100 Day MA on the daily..if the indices don't atleast hover around there or bounce up cleanly back to normal trajectory, then to me, theres downside potential as buyers are not stepping up and interested in entering long positions at this point...so thats when i looked into some short term puts to hedge..

also outside noise was strong this time - yields at new highs (3.2% is pretty attractive to a lot of ""safe"" investors so i can definitely see why they would sell stocks and go for the guarantee 3.2%)...trade war tension still amuck, EU banking contagion fear, feds being too hawkish, etc. 

seems like a pretty good recipe for a sell off if you ask me when you combine it with the fact we have been printing new highs for the last few months now...

i dunno about the long term trend change, thats not something anyone can predict...but short term? ya you can combine some things like what i just said and make a calculated bet that theres gonna be some volatility",HinduHamma,wallstreetbets,25.0

27,2018-10-12,"You need to learn RSI and spot bullish/bearish divergence. A little knowledge of Elliot waves and fibonnaci is also key. That’s how I realize I needed to go on a long position today. Bullish divergence on $SPY on all time frames below 2 hour, meaning we are in for a small bounce to ~ 280. 

Which means we are going green tomorrow. If you are in any positions, ladder sells to cut losses or take profits. 

Times like this risk management is key. Play so you will only lose 1-5% of your portfolio if you lose. 

Bear Market is meant to take out new traders. Just don’t mess with the market if you are scared. If you want to mess with the market, I can’t stress this enough - play small positions.

284,2018-10-11,"I figured there'd be a post like. 

First, just a heads up to all newbie option traders trying to play the market this week. The VIX is now at 23. A very big jump +40% yesterday. The VIX is literally based on the prices of options. 

**So what this higher VIX number really means is that option prices are now much more expensive than they were before.**

Whether you think the market will recover back up, or you think it will keep falling, and you have some creative plan to trade options to take advantage of that move, note how expensive options are now. **You could guess the direction of the market right the rest of the week but the now higher option prices can be *too high* to cover the amount the market will move before the expiration = leaving little or no room to profit. Hard to get to breakeven with these prices, even when you get the direction right.**

If you're going to try options this week, now more than ever is the time to finally learn about how implied volatility pricing works.

Personally:
1) I am going to watch the market a bit before making any moves. Seen too many dumb plays trying to buy a dip on something that looks cheap then it keeps falling. Or other traders assuming this the big crash they always say needs to be coming that's been building for a while, buying puts on everything, only to see the market stop falling and recover in a matter of days or weeks. No ones knows how this week will end. I don't need to catch the exact bottom. I'm ok waiting to see a turn in direction and the speed of recovery before buying again. 

2) I am also going to spend some time today and rest of the week hunting for deals in less popular names. Everyone knows about UVXY, SPY, MSFT and MU etc. These are the types of securities with the worst highest option prices now. And they are the least volatile. You can still make money on them, but it's harder than other places in the market right now. I will be looking further into the future and lower in the money than I usually do. I will also be looking at different dates and calendar spreads. 

3) I don't usually trade credit spreads or ratio spreads. But at these prices I might be. Especially in shit stocks with crazy high option pries.

To those bros down big, we feel your pain. Be careful about doubling down. Actually be careful about making any big rushed moves after hard losses trying to recover back up without thinking twice and doing your due diligence. Shit be expensive and desperation is not a good head space to rush things in. If you suffered from a big move against you or missed out big gains this week you almost bought beforehand, we know what that's like. You can recover from losses but be open and honest about timeframes, things fall fast and it might take longer for the gains to build back up. Great time to learn about different trading strategies under different market conditions. 

For other guys thinking to take what's left in the account take a break from this stuff for a while or leave this game entirely, that's cool too, active trading for FDs is mostly luck and not a long term game, no judging, enjoy your peace of mind, you will be missed, F for respect.

They run a fuckin AUCTION based system, with spy-like ad targeting.  You can use A.I. to automatically show your ads to people who are interested in your products.

Even if they didn't get more ad spots...their earnings will still grow bigly because ads are auction based.

They actually sandbag earnings by opening new adspots (on IG, Stories, Whatsapp, etc.).  It actually lowers the CPM of ads(because there are more places to show the ads).

Once there is no more places to show ads..the cost PER ad will rise significantly (and so does their earnings). 

They are keeping ad costs low by opening up new adspots (and sucking in marketers to their system.)

The reason Google Adwords are so expensive is because there is limited ad spots.  FB ads will soar in price too down the road (they've been creeping up, but are still relatively inexpensive).

To answer OP..FB has a low forward PE because they are undervalued right now.  Simple as that.  Dumb ppl are scared and have irrationally sold the stock off.  Great opportunity",robmartin,wallstreetbets,27.0

Serious: Stocks are like gambling, but maybe with a little better edge than a casino depending upon your moves. Only use money you can comfortably lose, or obtain some winnings through safe investments (long SPY, VOO) and use the winnings for FDs. Losing 50% or 90% of your portfolio feels like shit. Please don't lose your house or car on it.

In the downswing near the end of October, I had a quick -10k (\~50% swing, VIX puts SPY calls). I went to Foodmaxx and bought a few pumpkins and smashed the hell out of them. It was fun.

In other words, even if he got lucky, his max downside was still fully collateralized. I'll reread the post to be sure I'm not misunderstanding.

edit:

You're right, I was wrong. My guess is that Robinhood doesn't handle the settling of the daily SPY options correctly. Especially since they allowed him to sell at market price in the morning.

6,2018-11-09,"Yeah. So - I guess the best way to explain is - I got lucky this week. Made $1500 every day this week with SPY FDs, buying at open then selling the next open. 

I got REALLY greedy yesterday, after the huge run up. 

Today, I figured the momentum and market wanted to push ahead, especially after the bloodletting in Oct. Consensus was that fed decision wouldn’t deviate from what was baked in, so I picked up 12/31 SPY $295s - like $1200 worth. 

Yuge spike downward, so I panicked. I’m out of day trades till Jan, so wanted to limit my losses into a vertical spread - bought the same amount in the wrong date - 11/12. FUCK! Didn’t even manage to sell 12/31s,  just bought 11/12s...with a closer expiration.


Anyway, market started to go up, so I figured momentum was downgrading the severity of the fed minutes, and jumped back in with another $1200 in next Friday calls.

Those started to go south, and low and behold, I did the same.fucking.thing again - BOUGHT 32 more calls instead of selling 19 (I never had 32 of anything...)  of a different expiration. 


Still couldn’t sell any of them to close due to PDT. So essentially - what started as a modest, $1200, 5-7 contract call play on SPY turned into a 73 contract jacked-the-fuck-up vertical autism spread.

I also would buy more puts or calls depending on which side I feel is going to go higher as well.

So basically the straddle is just a long term play that you can play off of.. I was not thinking any %..  

But there was one guy who played a huge straddle on QQQ and he came out with $80,000. I can't remember his name? the caddilac guy? 

He probably held that straddle 1 month or something but it was a big amount. That straddle worked because we have a volatile market and we will not be in the same place as now in 1 - 2 weeks from now..

The only other strategy is to buy straddles and let them ride for 3 months.  One leg will overturn the other and make profit after 2 weeks or even 1 month or so. 

For example, buy a straddle on SPY at 280. Watch what it is end of next week.



Also Look into vertical spreads and also while buying vertical spreads, buy a way OTM put or call with it and/or on both sides.

Play a straddle and then buy/close more single puts/calls as the market tells you where it's going. etc. stuff like that.

definitely buy 3 months out for your situation though. and then buy quick 1-2 week puts/calls as you see where the market goes end of day etc.

There was another guy on here that sold an MU credit spread that had a max loss of like $1k ot something (his entire account was only $2k). He got early exercised on his short strike, freaked out and didn't know what he was doing and sold his long strike for the pennies it was still worth, and ended up with something like 120k of MU shares with $2k in his account and was asking days later what would happen if he just continues to hold it with $-120k of buying power. 

This fucking retarded broker actually allowed him to sell his nearly worthless protective long strike contracts AFTER being exercised on his short strikes for 60x his account size. The long strikes of his spread made it so his max loss was only 1K but because robhinhood fucked up he ended up with 120k of shares of a stock that was in freefall with a 2k account. And after days hadn't issued him a margin call or even contacted him about it. I felt bad for the guy because he was just a beginner who didn't know what he was doing and was allowed to make a huge mistake that no broker on the planet should have allowed him to make. Idk what ever ended up happening with that but 1 bad gap down and he could have owned tens of thousands. 

&gt; I'm not even sure if he would be legally liable for the losses if SPY had tanked.

1. Oct 30th - bought $263P when SPY was at $265 and it breaks to $267 EOD and goes to $270 overnight and haven’t come back under $270 yet. Currently worth $0.23 (-95%), will expired worthless in 10 days.

2. Nov 6th - bought $275P when SPY was at $274...it breaks $275 EOD and goes to $280 overnight. Came back to $276 today but i already sold it for a 50% loss. It spend most of Thursday down 50-60%. Expiry was due next week, i guess you can say weak hands but after what happened with the $263P, can you blame me?

Barring Trump/Ji saying anything to worsen our trade war, we will probably see a decent bounce.  That being said, don't expect volume to increase next week.   Nobody wants to enter this market for long right now.  Volatility is high, lots of money can be made but it's literally gambling if you're buying fd's.  I'd expect another selloff Friday as the market loses all its weekly gains again. 

Slightly longer term for wsb.  At the biggest dip in spy next week I'll be buying some spy calls expiry before December China US talks take place and selling them before the meeting.  Should see a runup to that.  After that I'm all puts as there's no way trump has enough leverage plus dems are out for blood yadda yadda.  ",Harooooouuld,wallstreetbets,7.0

But the % of money you make is less. If you had the same amount of money in a few OTM Puts vs a DEEP ITM PUT and the SPY tanked sooner rather than later, you'd get more money out of your OTM Puts.

I will not buy calls at 273 because I expect volume to increase in power hour to break 273. Momentum is all bearish as of today and probably tomorrow. The reason why it didn’t before is the initial drop to 273 was on large volume and it traded flat for about an hour after the initial hit. Bearish momentum started to increase but volume also started to decrease because most people want to go long at 273 rather than short.

We had a HUGE runup to g20, a $11 change in the SPY in only 4 days. This is a classic case of buy the rumor. Now Monday might be sell the news. The amount of red will be determined by the news.

There are some technical indicators like rsi, macd, 50+ moving average is still bullish (the 50 also recently moved over the 200), close to its double bottom and resistance line. Historically December is one of the best month for equities. Also fundamentally these companies did well in earnings and a possible merger between Lockheed and 3L would be more efficient and provide more growth. The news painted their products as faulty (ex see Boeing). There are many negatives tho, but I believe more upside potential exists.

So there is no good answer.

  


I personally will try to get out of my trades tomorrow 930am because I hate options and implied volatility..

But ths thing is if you think we are going much higher then sell a few of your calls (if you have multiple) and keep the rest to see.

  


I really cant give you the answer because there are too many factors and of course I'm not an expert.

  


  


Now, as for if you sell/ write puts, you can close then out anytime before 4pm.

The idea is if you sell 265 puts, you dont want SPY to close end of day 1 penny below 265..

  


But either way you can close it if you see profit before that.

Hope that makes sense..

  


The risk is if someone exercises and then you will have 100 shares of SPY at $265 a share!

  


But you also can sell a spread, but you need to look these up..

Point is, just YouTube selling puts. I'm sure there is a much better video to really show you.

2,2018-12-03,"I imagine a few things will be cheap tomorrow. So take advantage. I should mention a few things we should all think about:

1. Puts will be very cheap the higher we go. So think about that as we ""rally on up"" 

2. Volatility will be dropping and if it gets ridiculously low from where it was, start buying in to UVXY or VXX or VIX etc..

3. Think about selling Puts as well, we know we won't go below Certain points for this week, so .. Sell SPY puts at strike $270? 

4. Watch volatility as we go higher, set alerts for the lows and buy in with shares or long term calls.. If you want to play it safe, wait till Thursday or Friday this week and see where Volatility is. We all know T-rex will start another sell-off drop again or there will be bad news sometime next year, You can count on that.


So think about selling puts as we pretty much just now forced a nice wall to stay up on till Christmas. So remember about selling puts.

Also if we get another Dow up 600 points day, then straddle it.  

Now, where are all my people who actually straddled at now from last week? Remember we were talking about it all the time?  Now look at that.. Like I said, we won't be were we were in a few weeks or so, and here is the proof with this tariff china news..

24,2018-12-03,"These days I mostly trade SPXL options. SPXL is a triple leveraged S&amp;P ETF. Option volume isn’t great, but it’s manageable close to the money. 

My strategy is to sell cash secured puts when the market appears to be oversold. I base that judgement in RSI, Bollinger bands, MACD, which are fairly simple to use. 

Once I sell the options, I just monitor the market on a daily basis (if you can’t handle fluctuations, either check less often or trade SPY options.) If the market spikes early on and appears overbought, I buy it back and wait for a lower entry point. 

If the market drops and I end up down, I simply wait for the stock to be assigned. I do this most of the time, but if the market seems overbought near expiration, I will roll my put to the next month at or near the same price. 

When I am assigned, I wait for overbought indicators and then sell covered calls. The key here is to never sell a call below the strike you were assigned at. Sometimes this requires me to sell calls a little further out than I’d like. 

Basically rinse and repeat. Long term there is almost no risk, because the S&amp;P always goes up. Don’t get me wrong- bear markets can last a long time, which would make this strategy harder to implement; however, long term(5+ years), this strategy is unlikely to lose money. 

Last thing- never sell/buy your entire position at once unless you have a really good reason to. It’s tempting to go all in at once, but no one can time the market consistently. I sell roughly 25-50% of my target position early on in the month then wait. If it move in my direction, I make money; but if it doesn’t, at least I can sell more options to average down a bit. 

At current prices, this strategy yields $1000-$2000/month per $25,000 invested. Doesn’t sound like all that much for this sub, but it’s 4-8/month(or 20-60%) and has much less risk compared to buying options. 

Of course, implement this strategy at your own risk. I am by no means an expert or advisor. ",R4ndomlyJ0n,wallstreetbets,24.0

Given the details we've already gotten from Chinese media, I'm not sure there's anything he can say to push SPY over the resistance at 281, but I don't really want to take any chances. MM sold a lot of OTM calls expiring 12/7 before the Powell speech and the G20 conference and some of them are going to be forced to buy shares on the way up because gamma. One big spike is all it takes to squeeze these guys hard. I've opened one put spread so I don't FOMO, but going to save the rest of my money, I figure there'll be plenty of chances to make money by just waiting until after the conference to buy puts.  

Assuming nothing crazy happens at the presser, It's looking like we'll get a slow slide back down to 260 over the course of the next two weeks leading up to the December rate hike.

Because of this choppy price movement, bulls are the ones that have to show us that they still have control of the market. If they don’t, the market (I feel) will maintain its current downward trend from the ath and continue to make lower-highs on the weekly. The bears just have a lot more things going for them right now than the bulls do. Bulls are running on blind optimism that the market will just continue to go up like it always has been, while bears are pointing at the monkey in office and overall tired and negative sentiment within the country and simply saying “hmm, that’s concerning”.

1,2018-12-05,"Ignore the other comment as he clearly doesn’t understand options very well. I’ll stick to the basic call and put in this explanation. 

An option is a contract that (is supposed to) function similarly to insurance. There is a buyer and a seller. The seller writes the contract to the buyer for a fee (premium) that is paid by the buyer. 

A call contract is an agreement that the buyer may purchase 100 shares of the underlying financial equity at the agreed strike price at any time between now and the expiration date from the seller in exchange for the premium paid. (Note: American contracts only — Euro does execute only at expiration and not any time in between.) 

A put contract is an agreement that the buyer may sell 100 shares of the underlying financial equity at the strike price at any time between now and the expiration date to the seller in exchange for the premium paid. 

Options are priced on a per share basis. So this example he paid $3 in premiums to the seller ($3 x 100 shares = $300) per contract and sold them to someone else later in the day for over $18 per contract ($18 x 100 shares = $1800.)

Options can be pretty cool not only because they essentially provide tremendous leverage but can also be useful to hedge bets similarly to how you might purchase an insurance policy.

This post is likely long enough and it really only begins to cover the basics. Read up on investipedis for more info or check out a book like Options as a Strategic Investment.

I hope this helps!

Edit: as far as what is SPX? It’s basically an index that mirrors the S&amp;P 500. You’ll see many of us trading a different symbol — SPY — which also mirrors the S&amp;P 500 at a 10% scale. (Ex: S&amp;P 500 might be at 2701.44 — SPY is therefore $270.14 per share.) However options can be traded on most stocks and not just indexes and ETFs. ",Netbususer,wallstreetbets,1.0

1. Market rally last week was because of dovish Fed. Rally wasn't enough to break past the 281 resistance. Market need dovish Fed AND a trade deal to move upwards. 

2. The trade deal is bullshit. The unsubstantiated progress the tariff man tweeted yesterday is an indication nothing actually got done. After 90 days we could easily be back on the road to 25% tariffs. 

3. Even if we get a real trade deal, that probably brings Powell back to being hawkish. It's starting to look unlikely that we can have both. 

4. Add the yield curve inversion killing banks today, and we have a recipe for a big move down.

186,2018-12-04,"Can’t tell if you’re serious but in case you are: yield inversion proceeds recession up to two years before they actually hit.  Assuming the market is actually a leading indicator by a quarter or two  you’re looking at buying puts either a year in advance or buying weeklies or monthlies over and over hoping to time the drop.  Either way you’re hoping the drop is hard and fast enough to offset the premium you’ll pay for the privilege of holding.  Think *The Big Short* minus the billions in capital.

For example Dec 2019 SPY 260p is $13.22 per.  Sure you don’t actually need to hold these to expiration to make money, and assuming you’re far enough from expiration a drop that isn’t even close to ITM can make you money, but as we’ve seen SPY can go from ~260 to 280 for months on end, and you could burn months of premium waiting for the index to drop low enough to make those sweet gains you want.

33,2018-12-07,"Short term bull thesis for those of you holding SPY doomsday puts for January. The Fed's mandate is to keep unemployment low and inflation in check. Right now both of those things are good (please correct me if I'm wrong), so combined with recent statements from Powell and the other governors, I think we could see a much more dovish than expected statement in December's FOMC meeting. I think this is especially true given all the talk they've done in regards to moving to a very data driven model. They'll get pressure from Trump as well (who we know now is glued to the screens regarding the markets) and that pressure on Powell seems to have paid off so far. 

I think it's possible we could see a statement indicating no hikes until March. Rally would be short lived of course, but could be enough to hold up the market for another quarter or so until inflation kicks in and they're forced to raise rates. Just my 2 cents",expand3d,wallstreetbets,33.0

indicators: RSI, MACD, Center of Gravity, Price Movement Oscillator, Ultimate Oscillator, CCI and Stochastics. 

when every indicator agrees there is room to drop, or room to climb, you best take notice. basically these indicators show a blend of 'how hard buyers are pushing the price up' and 'how far they managed to move the price' so by averaging their results it gives you an idea of wether they are pushing real hard to maintain a level or barely pushing and the thing is soaring off the shelf

23,2018-12-08,"Yeah you're exactly right: higher beta means that you can be a bit later in catching a trend because it might go for longer (it's not guaranteed ofc but on average that's the case).

I stick to ES/SPY because there's more eyes on it and I feel like I have a better understanding of its price levels. I mainly use NQ/QQQ for hedging an ES/SPY position (e.g. if I'm long ES but feel the need to hedge I'll go short NQ because of its higher beta, meaning I can be a bit late on the hedge because its potentially larger move will compensate for my late entry, if that makes sense).

In general if you're really interested in scalping then trading futures is required imo. With SPY/QQQ the commissions and bid/ask spread will really eat into your potential profits. Also you can get higher leverage with futures.

Ultimately I’d say that our modern market systems are one of humanities most complex and advanced system and that corporations typically return immense value to shareholders over time.

""Interestingly, 33 of the 46 past instances (72%) actually saw the SPX realize gains while the Death Cross was in effect. The problem is the losing trades were very large.""

**tl;dr**: it's not really a sure bet either way (like most technical indicators). 

Also note the SPX index may have performed a death cross, but SPY (which is adjusted for distribution and therefore a more accurate reflection of index returns) has not.

Things like theta and IV crush can chip away at your positions quickly , as I said I’m down about 20% on my strangle from today. I paid $550 for it. I would have liked to buy for a bit less but I knew this morning was not going to stay flat so I made my move at a premium price. Simply put today was the worst possible outcome . I locked in my trade when spy was at $264 and it closed at $264.07. So my losses are exaggerated . As long as It moves tomorrow I will be back to the $550 range if not more. At peak lows today, my puts were worth $510, while the calls still were worth about $100. It would have been a nice place to exit , but I got greedy or over confident and said we can get the puts to $550/$600.. never got the chance .

As far as my amateur TA goes, when a triple top/bottom support or resistance is broken, things go either way very quickly.

In our timeline, unfortunately the triple support got broken, yet surprisingly, the market came back just fine.

133,2018-12-10,"This is a short bounce. Tomorrow it will retest the low, just like it did November 23, just like it did October 29.

We are in a rangebound pattern, check out the SPY 3 month.

Peak resistance at 280, from there it falls to support around 270 before continuing to 262, it bounces off of support twice with a small green day in the middle. Then it goes back up, resistance around 270 again before continuing to 280.

If we make it past 280 then we've broken out of a triple bottom. If it bounces off of 280 and breaks below 260 then we've been beaten down by a triple top. We can't know which this is until the pattern breaks.

Small side note for bulls; if we do move back up after tomorrow, it could reverse at the 270 resistance instead of reaching 280 this time, which would be a bearish signal.

152,2018-12-10,"* i've been going against the average sentiment of the entire united states economy for almost 2 years now. It has been painful. First I thought reverse 3x index funds were a smart idea. Then I thought naked options on SPY would work. Then they actually did early this year. I also had calls on vix that I mostly sold on February 5/6. I took the summer off on being a bear and just kind of waited for September, which is when wikipedia tells me all the shit goes down.
* Now I'm more risk averse but still believe that there's money to be made in the death of the republic and I'm currently doing bear vertical spreads on index etfs. When there's a strong downward move I open short term bull vertical spread to hedge against my overall pessimism and contempt for irrational exuberance. Why the fuck ya'll so optimistic. We're fucked. Donald Trump's economy is going to turn into a dumpster fire and I stopped arguing with the mouth breathing incel twats who are gay for fascism and deregulation a long time ago.
* I think a lot of corporations fucked up with their share buy backs and long term debt obligations from M&amp;A and they are going to come back to bite someday. These jabronis bought back their shares to prop up prices, so executives could get their share price incentivized bonuses. There's so many more reasons for things to take a huge shit. Passive investing bubble, interest rates, end of business cycle, demographic changes i.e. baby boomer retirement. GE and GM are canaries in the coal mine. I think there's more to come.
* I read Ray Dalio's Understanding Big Debt Crisis over thanksgiving. As you can probably imagine I was a lot of fun around the t-day dinner table. I'm also into real vision on youtube. Those macro economic investors are my boys. The time for value investing will return but not until a big deleveraging occurs.
* I love /r/wallstreetbets but I'd never fuck around with the dumb shit I see on here. I've got my own dumb shit. What really get's me amped is being right over 1 or 2 of the fucktards that've talked shit to me on WSB about my opinions.

Your option is now down 40% to $0.60. You suggested selling 261.5p, which will have even less value so let’s say $0.50. You can sell that for a credit of $50. Cut your max loss from $100 to $50 no matter what happens next. 

Scenario 2: fed says we actually need to hike these bad boys higher than expected. 

Your option moons! It’s now worth $3, but you’re out of trades and want to lock in. You can sell that 261.5p for $2.75 and lock in on $275 profits.

Either direction you are minimizing your risk going forward. 

Riskier Play to scenario 1: You completely changed your mind on that 262p and decide the market is going to rally through December. Rather than taking a loss you could sell closer puts. You decide that SPY is going to 270. So you sell 263p for $1.25. Your max loss is now the difference between : 

gains from the spread ($1.25 - $1.00) $0.25
-
Collateral from the spread (263 -262) $1.00 
= ($0.75) or max loss of $75 

with a max profit of gains from spread = $25. 

Same rule applies to scenario 2 for a riskier play. Sell further out in addition to your long put if you believe we’ve maxed out for additional profits.

90,2018-12-11,"The goal of a hedge fund is to make more money than the market (for most shops they are trying to beat the S&amp;P500). To do this, they need to pick stocks that will perform better than the market - i.e. stocks that will go up more than the market goes up or stocks that will go down less than the market goes down. Remember the market is not some nebulous idea - it is nothing more than the semi-appropriately weighted average prices of whatever companies you consider to constitute the market.


Because of this focus on stock picking (in the industry it's called security selection, or ""alpha"" but like nah), hedge funds want to protect against losses in the event that the whole market shits the bed and everything goes down, because that's the one case where you, anyone, just seriously has no clue when it's going to happen. It's insurance against some black swan type shit - even if you are right about the stocks you picked having good prospects, everything goes out with the tide - hell for no reason than soft hands are hitting SELL on the total market index funds in their 401k after hearing Jim Cramer tell them his shit last night smelled like one he took in 1987. So they buy SPY puts to make a little bit of cash if the whole market falls. If you own positions set to make a lil bit of cash if the market falls, your overall portfolio is very much insulated against broad market declines. Granted, you're out 1.8% for the holding period if things advance, but in that case any underperformance will be due to your shitty stock selection - and you can know that now with certitude. But the goal is to pick stocks that outperform.


This process of trimming market-correlated risk, in this case by going short the total market while long individual stocks, is called hedging. The process I described is the literal namesake of hedge funds. Hence it is dumb that OP made a post about arguably the most famous hedge fund on the fucking planet hedging their long US equity positions with SPY puts. A 1.8% SPY put position to hedge $24bn in assets is probably the least ballsy trade anyone with that size assets could make. It is the opposite of that. Risk-reducing",assombroso,wallstreetbets,90.0

In early October 2018, I had become more disillusioned with the stock market than ever before.  Money was becoming more and more abstract; It was becoming nothing more than a collection of numbers on a screen. Likewise, the market felt like a mythical beast that was toying with me for the sake of its own enjoyment. It laughed at my every move. I bought AMZN calls. The market went down one percent and the calls subsequently lost 70%. I bought the dip the for a good discount. 287 SPY calls would do the trick, I thought. The market went down another 1% the following day. Seeing my mistake, I sold those calls and went YOLO into SPY puts. $12,000 deep. $10,000 on SPY 287P 11/9. $2,000 on SPY 285P 10/19. The date of purchase was 10/08. Immediately after YOLOing the market reversed course. The beast was laughing at me once more. The puts lost 25% into close. $9,000 left. Monday evening felt bad. I had lost money on calls, changed to puts, and continued to lose money on puts. Perfectly wrong. The beast kept laughing. Tuesday rolled around and pretty much nothing happened. Wednesday. Wednesday…


I had 2 very lucid dreams on Tuesday night. I dreamt that I woke up, checked my phone, and saw the reckoning. 90% loss. Ouch. I knew it. You’re retarded. Of course that was going to happen, you idiot! Those were the thoughts that dream-state me had. I was distraught.


Moments later, I had another dream. I dreamt that I woke up, checked my phone, and saw the moonshot. My account was up 500%. $50,000! Wow I can’t believe it fucking worked! I smiled. The beast had been defeated!


I woke up, checked my phone, and my fingerprint reader wasn’t working. My hand was too sweaty in anticipation that my phone couldn’t unlock. Every attempt to dry my hands was to no avail. Fuck it! I’ll Google “spy stock” and see if I should even bother. The result came back with the SPY down nearly 2% and the trajectory was straight down to the fucking floor. A rush of adrenaline flowed over me. I had a massive bet on downies and the market was down! I was absolutely exalted. When my finger dried up, I saw the glory. +140%. Wow! The account was touching $20,000 again, swinging wildly back to $15,000, and then working its way back to $18,000. This was happening in a span of seconds. Thousands of dollars made and lost. In seconds. I sold. Decided to “not be greedy” and got the fuck out around $17,500. Phew! That was crazy, I thought. I’ll wait for the market to stabilize and plan my next move with hopefully a little less risk.


Midday rolled around and the market had flattened out. Okay, it looks like the panic has subsided. The beast had been weakened but he was not dead. Not by a long shot. AMZN calls were down 85%. Maybe we will see a bounce, I thought. $13,000 on AMZN uppies. So far in the money that the beast couldn’t possibly hurt them. The beast crawled deep into the cave where those poor uppies were sleeping and he fucking devoured them. The power hour market sell-off commenced. AMZN tanked into close. $17,500 became $6,000. I was embarrassed and also shell-shocked.


The next day, $6,000 was down to $1,500. And I was officially rekt. If my phone could never be unlocked to sell those puts… Worse yet, if I got into a random car accident and was hospitalized for 2 measly days… my account would have reached the promised land. Break-even, which would have been around $45,000 at the time. But then what would I have gambled on next?

8,2018-12-13,"I bought cheap stock during that time for a ""buy the dip"" sort of play, no options though. I remember when Lehman Brothers went down the Dow took another really big hit and it was pretty much the same thing on the old forums at the time that you see here on this sub. People went all in December and January trying to short already dead stocks, walking away with like 3 cents of profit, getting destroyed by random bear market rallies, or sometimes getting lucky. No constant twitter to worry about but bailouts were a concern. You could be shorting a bank or whatever, then bailout announced for it and the rally on it would kill you. Lots of ""the end is upon us,"" ""next stop Dow 20k,"" triple bottom this, double top that. Hell, I remember trying to short Walgreens around that time. Moved like 20k in a short position after selling a lot of stock I was holding because I was convinced they were gonna go bankrupt and honestly I feel like it was because someone on the internet told me but can't remember the exact details. Lost a big chunk of it because they had already hit rock bottom. A lot of people figured the whole crash was gonna be worse than it was too so I wasn't the only one I guess. Dumb thing about all of it was that I should have just bought a house or held my original stocks with all that wasted money because then I'd probably actually be a millionaire

""Sombre week, down 80K (20%). Got caught the wrong way on most major  positions. A little gain on monday, followed by deep whipsaws on Tuesday  as the market (SPY) moved from 97 to above 98 to back to 95 to 98 and  back down to 95: lost 60K in stock and options as I lacked conviction.

145,2018-12-12,"I like to joke around on here but if you're looking for serious advice, this place isn't it. It's a casino filled with degenerates that take people way too seriously. My personal goal is to get to 25k to day trade and I've made huge mistakes I can't afford but managed to claw my way back from calling it quits. Serious advice from my hard earned lessons:

&amp;#x200B;

Take a week starting in January and watch for SPY patterns. Read the news, see events or catalysts that could affect the market. As much as people say we are in a recession, we are not yet, it's just a correction and currently in a bear market that will last another month or so (again, from reading the news and reading what analysts have to say). Make small options trades and stay within the money but not necessarily at the money. OTM is cheap but chances of it happening are small once there's the steady increase. No volatility will leave the option near worthless and you might pay more than what you want if you buy at the wrong time. That said, don't buy in the morning; volatility is high which raises premiums so if volatility lowers (usually around lunch) your option becomes less valued. I buy the opposite of where we are at lunch; for instance I bought a put when it opened high because I thought it would come down; it didn't but I will only lose $200 from my guess which I hinged was 70% right from watching day patterns on SPY the past month.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't hold over weekends, don't play earnings, don't play individual stock options you know nothing about, and don't join the hype train; lessons I learned the hard way and lost money on.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not a professional and have only been trading since August so take what I learned worth a grain of salt but I was down 75% beginning of November and now only down 40% because I got lucky but I also didn't do the things I said not to do.

&amp;#x200B;

There are people here who are way smarter than me and might kybosh everything I've said but this is just what has worked for me and what I've seen work for others. ",flacopaco1,wallstreetbets,145.0

325,2018-12-12,"No you don’t have to wait. You can buy to close your short position (the written one). You’d only really want to do that if things are turning back around. Going back to the first scenario where you sold 261.5p for $0.50. SPY tanks and you think you can make profits (or lower your losses) on your original bet, 262p @ $1.00.  Things turn around and the 261.5p is $0.60. You buy that option and now your total debit is $1.10(original + difference in the 261.5p). So as long as the 262p is valued at $0.60 or more, you’re better off closing the short position early. Note that this is technically increasing the risk since now you are only left with the long put and max loss is $1.10. 

But if things don’t turn around, yeah. Let them expire. I’m not positive on this, but I don’t think you’d find a case where closing early nets you less losses than the $50 and both are losing value. 

Another way to hedge your bet is to sell puts expiring sooner than the 262p. The value will always be less than yours,  but it’s a way to get credit to help lower your overall debit. Theoretically, if you bought far enough out you could potentially sell weeklies to the point where your initial debit of $1.00 is paid off.",TheGunnerGooner,wallstreetbets,325.0
