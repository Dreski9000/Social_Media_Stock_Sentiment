Put a little extra cash into some ETFs like VOO and VTI, then a few safe bets like Microsoft and some more dividends stock over 15 years. You’ll prob do better than 75% - 80% of the people here in terms of rate of return.

Or... you can just gamble and go big..buying options and leveraged stuff and maybe come out with a few houses and hang out with lil’ yachty on his lil boat. Just think about it - Lil’ Yachty!! 

You could also go somewhere in between. 

I’d also add this:

1) don’t put in more then you’re willing to lose
2) don’t buy it all at once, spread it out to minimize risk
3) diversify - buy options, grab dividend stock, buy safe things, go for diff sectors 
4) put aside some money for fun/gambling and learn. Even if you lose $$ you can make it a learning experience

&gt;SPY is an ETF, not a mutual fund, and it's not even the lowest cost S&amp;P 500 ETF. It is, however, the most liquid S&amp;P 500 fund. Liquidity indicates how easy it will be to trade an ETF, with higher liquidity generally meaning lower trading costs. Trading costs are not a big concern to people who want to hold ETFs long term, but if you’re interested in trading ETFs frequently, then it’s important to look for high liquidity funds to minimize trading costs.

Pay off your debt at the minimums, accumulate as much low-interest debt as you can, and invest any cash you have into whatever will allow you to retain purchasing power for as long as you can.  In the meantime, all of our wages will continue to be devalued from under us while most people cheer because of, 'yay free 1200 dollars'.  Meanwhile, look left and look right, and realize that over 30 million full-time, adult employees in the US, a number that represents almost 30% of the labor force, are making less than $10/hour.  The working poor, 40 hours a week of their life...  working, they have jobs, they're not bums.

2,2020-12-12,"I created a simple Python trading bot for IBKR that uses ""The Wheel"" strategy

[https://github.com/brndnmtthws/thetagang](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/thetagang)

Hey WSB,

Not sure if this is WSB appropriate because it isn't YOLO material, but I thought I'd share anyways because people in the other trading subs liked it. Maybe some of you will eventually realize it's better to have money than not have money. I also like to share the good word and collect GitHub stars which I'm sure will be worth something some day.

S'anyway, I wanted to automate one strategy for my main buy and hold account, and after a lot of messing about with various brokers/APIs I settled on IBKR for a variety of reasons. I decided to release the work I did as an open source project (you can maybe tell from my GitHub profile that I've been building software for a while, and I make things open source when I can).

I wanted to solve these problems:

* automate trading as much as possible to remove emotional mistakes/issues
* work with broad market index funds, like SPY/QQQ/VTI/TLT/BND/whatever rather than individual stocks (I prefer not to mess with stocks unless I am o.k. with losing money)
* provide more consistent returns while clipping some of the short term gains (we do this through covered calls)
* taking advantage of the historical profitability of writing puts instead of buying the underlying (check out [this paper](https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/indices/documents/pap-assetconsultinggroup-cboe-feb2012.pdf))

This strategy is based on something called ""The Wheel"", which is useful when you a) want to own the underlying stock or ETF and 2) want to harvest from the volatility along the way. It's a somewhat passive strategy (compared to trying to guess uppies vs downies), which is my preferred way of investing.

I won't go into a ton of detail here on why this works (or rather: IF it works), but you can check out content on YouTube or wherever to learn about 30 delta covered calls, 30 delta BuyWrite indices, theta decay, so on. From that you draw your own conclusions, and decide whether it's the right risk/reward profile.

# Example Usage

You really need to read the project README to get a better sense of how to use it, but if you REALLY want to start quick you can run it with docker (you'll still need to create `thetagang.toml`, the config for the bot, and `config.ini` for IBC, samples of which can both be found in the project):

    $ docker run --rm -it \
         -v ~/ibc:/ibc \
         brndnmtthws/thetagang:latest \
         --config /ibc/thetagang.toml

I'll be around for a little while to take questions but if you don't make me feel cute I might delete later.",whirl-pool,wallstreetbets,2.0
