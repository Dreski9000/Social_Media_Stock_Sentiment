16,2020-01-03,"Lmao, dont take advice from ppl on the internet. But...long dated depends on the play. If you dont have a price target, stop loss, entry, and time frame for the play in mind you shouldn't take it. In this case, after the 12/24 move, AMZN crossed the 200 Day Moving Average, as well as 3 pivot highs from the last 4 months. Combine that with the fact that it was below its ATH following a 30% Nasdaq gain for the year, conditions were ripe for AMZN to go back to its ATH, especially since earnings were coming up end of Jan. So my plan was to bet on all of those factors bringing AMZN to 1980-2040 before earnings. So I bought 1900 1/24 calls. I bought a few days too early, but they didn't hit my stop loss, so I'm still in the play till it hits profit target. $100 if it doesn't reach that PT by next Friday, or $100 on one and $150 on the other if they reach $100 on or before next Friday.",straightCrimpin,wallstreetbets,16.0

The market decided to take a shit for three whole days and i was down 93%. It was Dec 31 and i decided to pull the trigger and tax harvest thus giving me weak hands. Now as we speak, AMZN just broke 1900 and I’m sad. If it wasn’t Dec 31, I would have held. Also to add salt to the wound. I bought 35k worth of TSLA 460 1/24 the same day anticipating a delivery beat soon and then an analyst tanked it 5% the next day. I sold that too.

23,2020-01-02,"Nice. Those things took me for a ride today and it wasn’t fun. The 1/3 weekly call at 1892.5 strike  experienced the following action today:

2:37- $11.15
2:38-$9.84
2:57- $14.15
3:15- $9.38
3:23- $12.25

The only reasons I didn’t panic and sell around 2:38 was AMZN volume and watching the QQQ minute chart closely. If QQQ had started to dump I was going to sell, but it was pretty steady. Around the high, I put in a hedge and ended up closing out shortly after  which was the right move. Can’t imagine holding those things overnight facing expiration.

Otherwise, if the short option is in the money you are almost always going to be assigned and will be obligated to buy or sell 100 shares at the strike price even if you have a long option that is out of the money.

2,2020-01-07,"You can think of implied volatility as the thing that's being backed out from option prices.  Like it's just easier to list everything as an implied volatility rather than as a price, because the prices themselves are meaningless.  You can back out the implied volatility from option prices because every other factor that goes into the options prices is known or can be a fixed constant (so like even if the dividend is not actually known yet, you can input a constant for it).  That's the whole reason to have IV in the first place, so you can have a better comparison of prices.  Otherwise, the option price on AMZN vs the option price on a much lower dollar stock like AAPL would not be comparable, but IV allows them to be compared.  The other thing IV does is it normalizes puts and calls, since by put-call parity, the IV for puts and calls of the same strike and same expiration are supposed to be the same (it's not always the same for early exercise American options but those are rare cases, and we shouldn't go into that here).

So when demand for something increases, the prices of the option will also increase (like regular supply and demand).  This will cause IV to increase because there's a direct positive correlation between prices and IV.  Higher prices (and everything else constant) -&gt; higher IV from the formula.  Obviously, everything else needs to remain constant here.  In reality, not everything is constant (spot changes, time changes, etc.), so it's really a multi-dimensional problem.",y7nx90,wallstreetbets,2.0

**GrubHub (GRUB), the Chicago-based online food-delivery service, could find a likely buyer in Uber (UBER), according to Morgan Stanley, with the investment firm saying the industry overall looks poised for consolidation.**

**GrubHub is considering strategic options including a possible sale of the company, according to a report published Wednesday by The Wall Street Journal.**

**GrubHub is facing competition from three key rivals but Uber has a ""unique position"" as a possible buyer, said Morgan Stanley equity analysts led by Brian Nowak in a Thursday research note. Privately held DoorDash and Postmates ""lack public equity currency"" and will likely need to raise cash in the coming 12 months to 18 months ""to support their current cash-burning business,"" the firm said.**

**""Therefore, it would appear that UBER may be the most likely potential suitor, and should such a transaction emerge, in our view, this would be bullish for UBER,"" said Morgan Stanley, noting that it still sees about 60% upside for the stock.**

**The ride-hailing company runs the food-delivery service Uber Eats and GrubHub runs Seamless, a New York-based delivery service it acquired in 2013. Morgan Stanley said Seamless could be a strong addition for Uber.**

**The ""Seamless asset and its entrenched position with corporations would likely be beneficial to UBER as it works to grow and maintain its corporate rides business (which is higher-margin). It would give UBER more flexibility and offerings when negotiating and we think corporations would value a single-contract dual Rides and Eats corporate offering."" Morgan Stanley said.**

**GrubHub's strategic review is still in early stages, according to the WSJ, citing people familiar with the matter. The company is also examining what to do if activist investors take an interest in the stock. Morgan Stanley has previously said the ground is fertile for consolidation because of the need for a ""more rational"" market structure in the online food-delivery industry.**

**""The runway is long (on 8% current penetration) but generating cash flow in a highly competitive food delivery industry (heavy discounting/couponing, sub-optimal driver utilization, growing lower margin chain business,etc.) is challenging,"" it said. The firm also pointed out that there are industry restructuring moves under way in Europe and in China, South Korea, and India. In the UK, regulators are taking a more extensive look at Amazon.com's (AMZN) investment in Deliveroo.**

**GrubHub shares were up 0.2% Thursday afternoon. They surged Wednesday after the WSJ report, closing up nearly 13% at $54.75.**",kemar7856,wallstreetbets,33.0

Woke up with headache, ate, laid down, then fell asleep for like 8-9 hours and woke up around 12:30pm. Woke up once but went back to bed. Then ate again, brushed teeth, laid down and got sleepy, and took a nap for a little less than two hours.

If my quick maths checks out, that's about 17-18 hours or sleep. Wow, so nice to finally catch up a bit since the entire week it was only 4-5 hours per day. 

Late Friday evening someone mentioned in a PM to stop taking magnesium since it could affect sleep. Hard to pin point exactly why I'm sleeping better, but that's got to be one of them.

Well now it is time for an all nighter. Plan to be awake til around 3pm PT tomorrow, which is around 22 hours of awake time from the nap.

It was exhilarating, but it made me start to expect those gains, and when you’re trying to make that kind of money routinely you can start having a problem. As others have said, when it’s in a 401K it’s effectively just numbers on a screen.

Robinhood account options, I made 35k from 2k on LK a couple months ago. That was actually life changing as I’m essentially living paycheck to paycheck. I paid off all of my debts and have been shoveling a couple thousand a month profits from additional RH profits into my bank account lately. My day to day life is exactly the same though. I don’t spend any more or any less than I did before. 

I do find myself buying options on a whim more often and losing 2 to 3k per play. But then I’ll hit another 8k or 10k option play that works out and I end up a little bit again. It works until it doesn’t. 

Part of me really wanted to put the remainder of my RH account on Microsoft earnings calls next week. So, there’s that. Definitely have a gambling problem. But it’s not a problem until you’re losing.

You should try vertical spreads. You can get AMZN or whatever contracts for really cheap. You trade the width of the spread instead of only buying a call or a put or whatever. So if you buy 1 2000c and sell the 2050c, you're betting on the width of $50 wide spread. You're essentially betting on like a 1-2% move range on AMZN depending on your expiration.

1) they're getting into the 5G market,

2) Landing the first Jedi contract with US govt. means future large govt. Contracts will go to MSFT just because they built one up already and US govt will not spend a fuck ton of money to build another one from scratch again.

3) They are no 2 in cloud right now and kicking ass
Amazon is no 1 and guess what? Amazon makes most of their money from the cloud. Their store sales actually loose money.   So MSFT is gonna be just as huge as amzn in the near future because azure is cloud &amp; physical vs Amazon is just cloud.  This is a major reason why Jedi went to MSFT..

4) windows 7 is no longer being updated forcing people around the world to use 10.  Smaller part of Microsoft but still big.

The max loss is the difference in the strike prices times 100.  The max gain is whatever you collect in premium.

For example, if I were going to do this with AMZN right now, based on current prices for 2/21 options, I might:

- Sell AMZN $1950 Put for $6.43 / share ($643 total)
- Buy AMZN $1940 Put for $5.65 / share ($565 total)

My best case is that AMZN stays above $1950, and both contracts expire worthless, and I keep $643 - $565 = $78

My worst case is that AMZN goes below $1940.  In that case, the first contract obligates me to buy 100 shares for $195000.  The second contract ensures I can sell 100 shares for $194000.  So I would lose $195000 - $194000 = $1000.  (In reality I would close both positions before expiration and take the loss, rather than have to deal with actually buying and selling shares.)

So, in this specific scenario, I have put $1000 at risk in order to make $78, or 7.8% if things go my way.",alanwj,wallstreetbets,9.0

For all the noobs about there. Here are my big lessons on the market. 

1) Earnings are wayyyy too risky to hold through. Do not hold through earnings. Buy 1-2 weeks out when IV is still low, watch that shit swing up right before the bell on ER day. Sell \*minutes\* before 4pm. 

2) If a company drops after ER, and if they only missed ER by a little bit, then buy that fucking dip and watch it rip in the coming days/weeks. 

3) Do not buy PTON or ROKU. They will fuck your life up. 

4) Play the big names, AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT, V. 

5) Red days usually mean green days are around the corner. Load up on red days, sell on green days. 

6) Do not buy PTON or ROKU. 

7) Do not play biomedical. See EPZM, AIMT. 

8) Listen to the old heads here, they have a lot of game.

Not sure when it’s launching and it’ll be paid but on the whole there’s a lot of companies moving into the entertainment space and only so much time people can spend watching random shit. Agreed on the AI/Quantum computing angle though. Google sounds like they’re doing well there just don’t know much about that space.

When is the best time buying entry on a stock that just seems to not have a lot of red days?

18,2020-02-12,"Semi-DD on new positions:
I’m thinking both QQQ and MSFT could take a few days to consolidate before climbing again. Also thinking the overall climate is bullish but we have a few risk factors for short term setbacks in play so I don’t want to run weeklies right now.

I bought $4.7k of AAPL calls today (4x 3/20 $320c) at an average of $11.89 when they were slightly ITM. I feel AAPL has some catching up to do vs. MSFT or QQQ and it tends to grow more consistently than GOOG/FB/AMZN/NFLX. Thought about TSM and tech ETFs but chose to just get more AAPL. It then went on sale after the news on regulatory scrutiny (reviewing all big tech mergers?) and the galaxy $1000 pricing announcement so I’m down ~$600. Anyone who wants to join in, this looks like an easy long play became even easier with the discount. I plan to carry this call until it’s about a week from expiry and see what Tim brings me.

I also took ~$1k of positions each in SPCE and PCG. 3x 3/20 SPCE 20c @$3.60 and 10x 3/20 PCG 20c @$1.03. I’m currently flat on those taken together, up a bit on SPCE and down a bit on PCG. 

SPCE is an interesting meme stock with a lot of chatter on here. Because the space tourism business is one of a kind on public markets and Sir Branson is going to not only be the president but also a client, a lot of long term and LEAPS buyers are getting in so it’s not as pump-and-dump as for instance DEAC. To the moon!

PCG is a California utility company that is on track to escape bankruptcy so share prices have been increasing steadily. Their ATH was $71.57 in 2017, and they dropped to ~$45 through October 2018 when they were engrossed in a huge wildfire settlement that ultimately looked likely to drive them to bankruptcy. The all time low was $3.55 just back in October 2019 when bankruptcy looked imminent. There were a lot of swings as the government decided whether to burn them to the ground or not. They now have reached a final settlement on the wildfires that leaves them solvent, and the stock has been strongly appreciating since then. There have been quite a few quality DD posts on PCG here over the last few months and the general sentiment is bullish.",johntaylor37,wallstreetbets,18.0

If a merger is small enough, you skip most of the red tape, as in nothing is reported.

Today the FTC announced that they are going to investigate all small mergers FAAAM (FB, Apple, AMZN, Alphabet, Microsoft) made since 2010.  They suspect that FAAAM has been abusing this to gut competition.  

I say the dip is fake because Microsoft is gunna quietly walk away from this squeaky clean  while attention is on FB, Amazon, and Google.  Apple will also get off without much trouble but they'll get a lot of attention.",KarmaKill23,wallstreetbets,101.0

2. Microsoft doesn't have anything controversial like Instagram to FB in terms of mergers that would trigger anti-trust. (I also work in tech and I have a personal bias that MSFT would come out of this on top and if anything it would be GOOG, AMZN and FB would be the ones that should be worried.
3. Article also confirms my bias that this shouldn't affect MSFT.

it looks like the ""precedent"" AMZN cites re: ""lost opportunity to work with the gov't"" were instances where the feds cancelled an open bid. AMZN's not going to lose out on any such opportunity here, it's obvious they're just nakedly citing the language in those cases hoping that the judge's clerk isn't going to read the cases themselves.

all of this is really just to say that

&gt; My opinion is that AWS can easily prevail on point 2.

is not so cut and dry. TROs have an extremely high burden that cuts against issuance of a TRO except in the most extreme cases, and so AMZN are going to have to rebut a very strong presumption that cuts against them. I just don't see anywhere that, if awarded the contract, that AMZN or any other contractor couldn't scrap all work done by MSFT to date and start from square 1 according to new contractor's plan.

all of this is to say that, most people asking for a TRO - ever - are generally not entitled to one, and i would be very surprised, because it's so unlikely that a TRO is ever granted, if this probability is not already priced in.",brettygud_,wallstreetbets,1.0

UPDATE: FTC to investigate 'hundreds' of past acquisitions made by Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook

 

Agency seeks information on smaller deals that did not receive scrutiny at the time, chairman says that process could lead to 'unwinding' of some of the mergers

Antitrust regulators widened their investigatory net into the top of the technology industry Tuesday, including [Microsoft Corp](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=205778). for the first time.

The Federal Trade Commission announced ([https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/02/ftc-examine-past-acquisitions-large-technology-companies)it](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/02/ftc-examine-past-acquisitions-large-technology-companies)it) plans to examine past acquisitions from Microsoft (MSFT), Google parent company [Alphabet Inc](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=140864). (GOOGL)(GOOGL), [Apple Inc](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=36276). (AAPL), [Amazon.com Inc](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=45294). (AMZN), and [Facebook Inc](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=45563793). (FB) The agency wants information from the five companies, which have a market value of more than $5 trillion, on their corporate purchases dating back to the beginning of 2010 that did not undergo scrutiny from the federal government under the Hart-Scott-Rodino, or HSR, Act.

In a conference call with reporters, FTC Chairman Joseph Simons deemed the request a study not related to law enforcement actions but an attempt to better understand the flood of transactions that are not reportable under HSR. He said there is no financial threshold for the size of the horizontal and vertical deals it plans to look at. The request grew out of the FTC's hearing last year on transaction activity among tech companies, he added.

He said the FTC would focus on deals of companies that could have potentially developed into larger businesses, and moves by tech giants that increased their influence in adjacent markets. Simons said the number of deals under scrutiny is in the ""hundreds,"" and could lead to the ""unwinding"" of some of the mergers.

""It is important to keep tech markets open and competitive,"" Simons said on the conference call.

""The orders will help the FTC deepen its understanding of large technology firms' acquisition activity, including how these firms report their transactions to the federal antitrust agencies, and whether large tech companies are making potentially anticompetitive acquisitions of nascent or potential competitors that fall below HSR filing thresholds and therefore do not need to be reported to the antitrust agencies,"" the agency said in its announcement of the investigation ([https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/02/ftc-examine-past-acquisitions-large-technology-companies](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/02/ftc-examine-past-acquisitions-large-technology-companies)).

The FTC's probe intensifies the heat on Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook, all of which have been under the piercing eyes of the federal government as well as European authorities for their competitive tactics, as they cement dominant market positions and delve into new areas of business. Microsoft, however, had escaped any scrutiny after surviving its own antitrust fight with the government in the days of the dot-com boom and bust ([http://www.marketwatch.com/story/big-tech-was-built-by-the-same-type-of-antitrust-actions-that-could-now-tear-it-down-2019-06-12](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/big-tech-was-built-by-the-same-type-of-antitrust-actions-that-could-now-tear-it-down-2019-06-12)).

The antitrust suspects: Facebook and Apple appear to be most at risk ([http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-antitrust-suspects-facebook-and-apple-appear-to-be-most-at-risk-2019-06-18](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-antitrust-suspects-facebook-and-apple-appear-to-be-most-at-risk-2019-06-18))

The companies' larger acquisitions are typically approved by the FTC before they close. Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, Google's purchases of YouTube and DoubleClick, and Amazon's merger with Whole Foods all received clearance from the FTC before closing.

However, Big Tech makes myriad smaller deals every year that are never announced and do not go through regulatory channels. For instance, Google closed on a $2.4 billion acquisition of software company Looker ([http://www.marketwatch.com/story/google-agrees-to-pay-big-money-for-big-data-startup-looker-2019-06-06](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/google-agrees-to-pay-big-money-for-big-data-startup-looker-2019-06-06)) in 2019 and agreed to purchase Fitbit for $2.1 billion ([http://www.marketwatch.com/story/google-to-purchase-fitbit-for-21-billion-as-it-beefs-up-its-health-capabilities-2019-11-01](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/google-to-purchase-fitbit-for-21-billion-as-it-beefs-up-its-health-capabilities-2019-11-01)) -- a deal that is still under review -- but also spent $1 billion to acquire other companies that the company does not name in its annual filing.

Apple largely avoids big-name acquisitions, but has spent more than $1.6 billion in the past three fiscal years on business acquisitions, according to its annual filing, and Chief Executive Tim Cook has said that Apple is buying a smaller company about every two to three weeks on average ([https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/06/apple-buys-a-company-every-few-weeks-says-ceo-tim-cook.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/06/apple-buys-a-company-every-few-weeks-says-ceo-tim-cook.html)).

""There are no adequate checks and balances on what these companies can do,"" Anamitra Deb, senior director of beneficial technology at the Omidyar Network, told MarketWatch in a phone interview. ""Years of being under-regulated made them less accountable. Mature tech companies at large scale need guardrails in the form of antitrust, more stringent privacy laws, and corporate governance.""

Big tech's dominance was the focus at a public workshop on venture capital and antitrust at Stanford University on Wednesday. ""Dynamic competition should drive markets. Investment should go to the best ideas. Disruption can create consumer value,"" Makan Delrahim, assistant attorney general, antitrust division of Department of Justice, said in opening remarks. ""These are the principles I've continually returned to.""

Shares in all five companies dipped in intraday trading immediately following the FTC's announcement. None of the five companies immediately responded to email messages seeking comment.

A Microsoft spokesman late Tuesday said. ""We look forward to working with the FTC to answer their questions.""

Amazon spokesman Jay Carney told CNBC on Wednesday that the Seattle-based company will cooperate with the FTC.",minigunman123,wallstreetbets,26.0

Amazon Web Services made waves Monday with its request to depose President Donald Trump and others, but this week’s signature moment in the Joint Enterprise Defense Initiative (JEDI) contract protest is yet to come. 

That’s because Court of Federal Claims Judge Patricia Campbell-Smith is expected to deliver a decision by Thursday on AWS's request for an injunction, filed Jan. 23, to stop the Department of Defense’s work on the contract. 


The injunction motion seeks to halt the Defense Department's plan to issue task orders to JEDI awardee Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) under the potential $10 billion cloud infrastructure contract while the protest case continues. The DOD wanted to begin issuing task orders after Feb. 11.  

AWS, a subsidiary of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN wants to prevent work on the contract because it is seeking more information, specifically answers to 265 questions it sent to the DOD following Microsoft's Oct. 25 award. The company alleged in Monday's filing that those questions were never answered.

An injunction could also ensure that, in the interim, Microsoft wouldn't complete so much work, ""to where it becomes sort of a fait accompli that Microsoft would end up winning in any re-competition or reevaluation,” said Frank Murray, a government contracting lawyer and partner at Foley &amp; Lardner LLP who is not working on the case.


Such a re-compete could be ordered by the court if AWS wins the protest.

“A lot of it comes down to how well have you been able to convince the judge to this point that you have a pretty good chance of succeeding once this thing goes the distance,” Murray said.

DOD Chief Information Officer Dana Deasy told reporters in December he aimed to stand up the unclassified portion of JEDI by mid-February, followed by the classified portion six months later and the top-secret portion after that. It’s unclear how AWS’ intended injunction will affect that timeline.

The stakes are high on the ruling, especially since the government has refused to voluntarily halt work while the case is ongoing, something it would have been forced to do if the Government Accountability Office (GAO) was adjudicating the protest. 

An injunction would be an indicator of the strength of AWS' case, experts say.

“A court would only issue that injunction if it thought that Amazon had a strong case on the merits,” said Charles Tiefer, a professor of government contract law at the University of Baltimore. Alternately, the court could deny the injunction motion if the government can show that allowing the contract to move forward maintains the status quo without harming AWS’s chances at a potential re-compete of the contract. 


An argument that the current state of affairs would remain unchanged could be difficult to achieve though, given that the DOD continues work on the contract and task orders would start new work.

A pause on JEDI doesn’t win the case alone for AWS, but it certainly keeps it in the game and keeps the possibility of a re-competition of the contract alive. A ruling on the protest is still not expected for a month or more.",SmargelingArgarfsner,wallstreetbets,55.0

I wasn't willing to go overnight with the calls, I have 13k in them and any gap down would be devastating. I weighed reason for up or down movement and it was too hard to tell what will happen, but I sided on a high likelihood of gap down or continued slide for rest of week. Reasons below:

Reasons for gap down/go down:

- indexes up almost 1% and MSFT barely moves. Indexes up almost 2% this week, and MSFT down. Indexes due for some cooling off and I'm afraid what a weak day would look like for MSFT given the strong days were horrible.

- Long weekend coming up. Investors will be derisking soon, especially with such a runup so fast. Could come Thurs, but prob will come Friday. Either way probably not good for MSFT.

- Lower bollinger band still shows potential downside to about 180.

- MSFT ran up a lot and fast valuing it at 1.4trillion, might need to dip a bit and cool off.

- That investigation going on about acquisitions.

- AMZN fighting JEDI contract.

Reasons for gap up/go up:

- It's MSFT and has some of the best investor sentiment.

- No analyst upgrades yet. They're probably coming and will be positive.

Suffering from an inferiority complex and unable to compete with her hotter sisters WBA, CVS sought attention in other ways. It started with kissing booths and moved quickly beyond, she would earn a reputation for being easy and convenient. But it was hard for anyone in her school to satisfy her.

She had her eyes on a guy that her sister was seeing on and off. Jealousy bubbled up whenever she would hear her orgasm induced screams from all night sessions. The whole town's women tremble when his name is uttered. The exagerrated reputation AMZN had was part of his deadly charm. Some say his thrust has enough power to get to low earth orbit, some say he has traveled the world and knows 40 languages, others say he could guarantee satisfaction within 48 hours. Either way, curiosity was getting to the best of her and so she plotted a way for their paths to cross.

One night, after her sister was throughly exhausted in another session, she positioned herself near the door way in nothing but a towel. As the door opened, she gasped at the sight of a giant of a man. Standing at 7 feet tall with bulging muscles all over and a staff the size of an arm, she nearly orgasmed simply from his towering figure. Without a word, AMZN grappled her by the throat and forced his enormous manhood down her mouth. Holding back her tears, CVS felt her gag reflex kick in immediately and her own cough being clogged by the newly formed air seal. As he slides his member back and fourth, she felt her consciousness fading in and out. They would find her lifeless body the next day with a large amount of rectal trauma and bleeding.",vegaseller,wallstreetbets,78.0

You know what everyone didn't have in their model a week ago? A 50bp fed cut. On Monday Asia will rally hard off it's Fridays close, catching up with the US close - setting stage for continuation of the fed rally.

Last chance to understand:
Think about how the situation changes from Friday morning to today. 

Morning:

-knew first US death will be any day now
-didnt know fed would be delivering 50bp cut

Today:

-first us death happened, couple days after first UK death, as predicted
-JPow makes a special statement that basically confirms the cut and perhaps it even could be a double cut-50bp

BA can go up while the airlines don't move though but usually when the airlines move BA sells off since the combination of all the airlines has more ETF weight than just BA.

2-0 means they sweep the best of three finals.

2-1 means they lose once in the best of three finals (win/lose/win, or lose/win/win)

The inverse bracket is the ""loser wins"" bracket. In other words, the ticker that loses every single round is the winner of the losers bracket. Tickers that have a redder day, or lesser green day, move on in the inverse bracket.

First buy was NFLX, which did well last recession as the cheapest media source with the largest library.  They get negative press because of many players (like Disney) pulling their content from streaming.  But all those titles are still available on DVD.  If people get poor and do what they did before, NFLX is going to get a big boost in DVD subscriptions.  


The other buy is AMZN.  They have famously automated warehouses and deliver.  Everyone who is too scared to go shopping is going to finally learn to shop online for everything.  My friends in China are getting 100% delivery of everything, and if the outbreak continues to worsen here I expect the same.  Next quarter earnings will bear judgement on that call.  


The last part is that those companies are weakly represented in QQQ relative to my esteem of them.

So, I've accumulated a lot of $T, $AAPL, $MSFT, $EMB, $BND, $BLK, $KR, $KO, $K, and some lesser amounts of other stuff.

Then after I get done buying that stuff, I usually have like $14 in cash just sitting there so I buy a CZR with it. This isn't part of any kind of strategy, I just like the concept of owning part (no matter how infinitesimal) of a casino. It lets me irrationally console myself when I put good money across a craps table and leave without it. So I accumulated about 20 shares that way. Then it spiked a little bit for some reason and I read (probably shitty) DD that implied it might trend up. I had a share of $AMZN at the time that I wanted to get rid of anyway, so I sold that and bought 80 more CZR. It did not go up. But whatever. I still own part of a casino.

8,2020-04-02,"SBA Lender here.  The program is a fuckin' mess right now, but here is the breakdown for the Payroll Protection processing fee part of the deal:

Up to $350,000 - 5% processing fee

$350,000 - $2,000,000 - 3% Processing Fee

$2,000,000 - $10,000,000 - 1% Processing Fee  


Every dime of those processing fees will be earned, there is a ton of documentation and communication and meeting that will take place.  In banking you can't just call up docusign or a similar company and get on board right away, it takes a lot of build out and vendor approval rules are very cumbersome.

Lenders are not excited about this program right now, the rules haven't been released and any money that is not forgiven is stuck on the bank's books termed out for 2 years at 0.5%.  It went from a very nice looking program to one banks are begrudgingly doing just to help their clients out.  

The businesses whose banks are not participating in the program might get left in the cold because many lenders are reluctant to take on those they don't currently work with because they don't want to end up with a ton of 2 year money paying .5% interest.  When the guidance looked like 4% was the interest rate, which is roughly market for small businesses, everyone was pretty happy.

Roll yield has nothing to do with the actual day you roll the contracts. Yes, the slope of the futures curve will dictate if you have the wind at your back or not during a trade, but absolutely not for the main reason you mentioned.

1) You are not factoring in that if the mega techs drop as much as you predict, the whole market would be way below 1800 S&amp;P. Everyone would be scrambling into mega tech and out of everything else. Mega tech is defensive stocks and will drop less than then market. 

2) 5G rollout has been delayed but not canceled. Aapl and all cloud plays will get a supercycle. Slower to rollout cuz of 🍺 🦠 but consumers and enterprises will still upgrade in 2021-2025

3) Aapl could buy DIS if it continues to drop. MSFT could buy Zoom. The point is, the titans will always have the better hand in a downturn. And will come out stronger in the other side. 

4) Don’t underestimate the bounce from the Announcement of a discover of a real vaccine. It will be late 2021 or 2022 But it will happen. And when it does, the recovery will be historic

1,2020-04-03,"Here's my thesis. If you object, don't just downvote, give some reasons. 

I had a theory for quad witching day. My belief was, after that day much of the stocks traded in indexes will begin to move differently. Perhaps it was a liquidity issue, however, I believed that from that day, many of the stocks would be correctly priced before continuing a downtrend. So while some companies fall, others would rise relative to a specific price. We haven't had circuit breakers come up after that day though I do understand that this may just be due to the consolidation phase. I buy SPY for the fun of it, but mainly I like to trade individual stocks. So while many of you guys keep your eyes on DIX, GEX, GLD, crude oil, I watch the charts of companies in banking, tech, retail and memes.

Perhaps the reason we don't hear circuit breakers and huge swings is also due to the fact that companies are better balanced within the indexes. For example, GOOGL, AMZN, s---, TSLA, LYFT moved very similarly. Now the only FANG stock that moves like SPY is AAPL. Since that Friday, it hasn't been the same. Tomorrow, TSLA will moon, but I'm willing to bet s--- will too (you'll have to figure that one out yourself, it's a company that I hold very dear). However, SPY and AAPL are prone to hammer down. I think the next leg down will be led by the bank sector, however with some companies moving higher to buckle the trend, I don't see SPY breaking circuits after hours. FYI I usually don't like to share my trades and favorite companies, but OP has been very insightful to the community so leaving my 2 cents.",silicapacks,wallstreetbets,1.0

Look, manufacturing companies are laying off thousands and oil companies are ready to declare bankruptcies. But AMZN is hiring more and NFLX is hardly affected.

My entire thesis at the moment is that we are more susceptible to additional shocks in our current state, so that's why I'm holding my ""portfolio"" in Options. I assume we do have different circumstances that influence the position we're taking, I'm youngish with a portfolio small enough that it still needs big returns to hit escape velocity (probably just how I rationalize it to myself), and I've got the feeling in my balls that this is how it's going to go down, so I'm going with my gut.  


I agree mostly about SPY not being the most efficient way to capture a drop. I'm about half in IWM, but my strategy has been to hold 5-10% OTM Puts dated a few months out, and sell short-dated Puts/Spreads/Iron Condors against them in the short term to level out the theta decay. This strategy doesn't work as well on any kind of ticker with speads larger than SPY, but I'm thinking more and more that I can separate the long-dated puts to other less liquid tickers and still harvest theta on SPY  


I definitely see MSFT and AMZN probably amongst others with bigger shares of the SPY coming out of this stronger, so that is an anchor to any large drops.   


Anyway, hope things go well for you, and hope you're ready for the drop when it comes...and that it comes. Thanks for giving me some things to think about, and sorry for calling you a dummy, it was a flippant remark. Just don't buy puts after a big drop, if that's what you were saying

The main problem with all of them is they are the highest weights in SPY and QQQ, the two most popular ETFs.  This means if a guy wants to offload risk and sell ETFs, these tech companies have to sell off.  However, at the same time, when people put risk back in, these are the first ones to recover and they are consistent in the recovery (the airlines or cruises or hotels might ""jump"" more day to day sometimes but are all over the place).

4,2020-04-10,"&gt;Dude very little is going to come back when we slowly start back up. This is fundamentally changing how we function as human beings.

But will we fundamentally change to human beings who spend LESS, or just humans who spend differently? 

&gt;It will be so long before stadiums will be allowed to be at capacity. 

So the orthodontist won’t buy season tickets, instead maybe they‘ll invest in renovating their kitchen or something. Net effect on GDP isn’t changed. 

Plus, you underestimate how poorly a lot of people are following social distancing even right now, and once “allowed” will end up doing it even at risk. 

&gt;Restaurants are going to have to reduce the number of tabes so that there can be more spacing between them. 

True I think the dine-in restaurant business will suffer near term, but if we are clear of COVID a year from now then that might not stick (lots of opportunity for new restaurants to open then, with historically low interest rates to invest in them). Plus short term it means there will be an increase in spending at grocery stores, on takeout, etc... it might not be zero sum but there will be some winners not just losers here. I mean we have a bunch of people out of work now but I’ve also had probably a 2000% increase in how much I spend on food delivery services. Add in the tips and I’m spending as much as I was at restaurants before. 

&gt;Imagine being on an airplane and someone has a coughing fit after all this.

Yes air travel will also hurt, but airlines have been a shitty business forever, and the Govt will not let them fail completely. 

&gt;There will be so much paranoia and fear still for so long. 

Maybe, again I think you underestimate how many people are acting like normal even right now. I’m seeing some really dumb moves like neighborhood cookouts 

&gt;My business has about a month or so more before it goes under unless I can get assistance, and that is the norm across the country now. 

Will the people who spend money at your business be able to continue spending money at it once things are reopened? That’s the big issue, because even if you fail that’s just an opportunity for someone else to step in and serve those customers. Hopefully it’s more small businesses and not just Walmart and AMZN. The issue will be whether those failed businesses that are no longer making you money, means there aren’t enough of you to keep spending... but most Americans just live paycheck to paycheck and spend everything they’ve got anyways. 

And for sure the numbers will not be as good, we aren’t quickly going back to all time highs. But we do know that the fed will be there to prop up bad debt and loans are gonna be basically free. We could be flat or slow growth for years. 

&gt;Maybe some manufacturing can begin mid-summer, but most of the things we took for granted like bars, restaurants, movie theaters, etc. may end up failing.

Yes many will fail. But again I think you miss the opportunity during a time of unprecedented Govt support and cheap loans.",sunnbeta,wallstreetbets,4.0

https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/fxioqv/lk_puts/

That's how RH is handling it.  As in, if you have shares to cover, they'll let you exercise your puts.  If you don't, it's tough luck - they let it expire worthless.

However, in reality, you should be able to exercise *regardless* if you have the shares to cover or not becuase you just get short shares (similar to selling short) and then the broker can borrow those shorts from the ITM call exercises that got long stock.

Yes, there's some risk to this, but in reality it's little.  Say you have the 15 strike ITM put.  You make 1k off of this with LK ~5 (now 0 if they don't exercise it).  Let's say LK unhalts and is 10 before you can buy your shorts back.  That's a 100% increase, and yet you still are up 500 from this.  So very little risk imo for a 5 dollar stock.

8,2020-05-02,"Breaking 293 is different from closing above 293 (which it didn't) ;). SPY closed at 282 today, so it's not a ""gap up"" if it opens at 282 / 283. A bullish sign would be an open above 285 / 286 on Monday, and that would probably need some sort of positive catalyst to happen. I would say 273 is probable but timing is really hard because there's literally dozens of things that can cause it to go either way. In the absence of any significant catalyst, I could see touching 273 some time next week.

FYI in case there's still people reading this and curious, there's several bearish signals that made me believe 293 was the top last week (although can be retested) and we'll see if continue to go down in the short term

\- Most of the major players in SPY reported now, there's no more earnings report to anticipate towards. AMZN in particular seemed like a let down because of poor forward guidance.

\- The best realistic outcome for the treatment breakthrough story happened, with Fauci basically announcing that we've reached our first step towards finding an effective treatment. We rallied, but didn't rally enough to break 293. We're not likely going to have any other events that can break that positive sentiment, so that's going to not be a positive catalyst anytime soon.

\- Volume on the way down from 293 has been strong, is growing, and is breaking the downwards trend since March

\- Not mentioned in the post because doing TA in VIX is sketchy and controversial, but VIX broke its downwards channel, meaning that we can see an upwards breakout next week back above 40

\- MACD crossover in 4h chart

\- Retail investors and r/wsb seems suspiciously bullish, and most bears have capitulated by now

I'm looking at the hourly and daily between Jan 30th (earnings after hours) and Feb 20 (start of covid crash). Jan 31 morning, it spiked to ~$2040, then sold off to EOD $2004. Even after the ""sell off"", it ended 7% higher than the pre-earnings price of $1987. It didn't drop below that price again until the covid crash when EVERYTHING TANKED.

* Jan: AMZN spike after earnings, followed by a brief sell off that ends still 7% &gt; than pre-earnings. This was followed by a rally to ATH before covid crash.

* Now: AMZN 7% drop after earnings, followed by sell off. 

They're two totally different situations in a much more volatile market. Have you seen the same post-earnings sell off in any previous quarters? With a sample size of n = 1, even if you're right it's not like this is in any way a substantive piece of evidence.

&gt; If it did that on good earnings, what would it do on bad earnings when it's even more overvalued.

So really what you're saying is that investors will think Amazon is overvalued and sell off.

27,2020-05-02,"For Google sure maybe. For Amazon though I could easily see more and more people turn to self hosting. Hell self hosting makes a lot more sense for a larger stable company than a newish growth company or a with highly variable loads. I think as the market shakes out we will begin to see less need for cloud services and a shift to self hosting and hybrid. If you have stable load a server pays for itself in like 3 months that is a hell of a roi to give up for a large web based company. Also I have a hard time believing that aws is any more durable than their underlying capital. AOL seemed like a monopoly that would be around forever 20 years ago look at them now. The companies that actually have lasting power are the ones who have actual capital or produce actual honest to goodness tech and ip in essential fields. Also of course well run and shrude business acumen can also produce a lasting empire. I think bezos could certainly fall in that camp. I don't think amzn value comes from tech, or their monopolistic power, but instead from bezos tactics. Amzn will continue to have a large hold on the market as long as bezos or equivalent at the helm, but they could suffer a far faster fall from grace than a lot of the other companies during a dip in leadership or direction. I believe that because their moats are not as deep as you think, their product is a commodity, and they do not have the tech, expertise, or capital holdings of other companies.  If you were to start today to recreate a companies ip and infrastructure from scratch how long would that take?

Amzn would have transitioned already. Drones and robots are the future. They probably won't be completely automated. There will be remote positions flying the drones and bots. The cost of human error will be more in the long run. 

Especially medical. They should be using people like me that are forced to watch a YouTube video for a weekend learning covid specifically.

As a tech knowledgeable millennial(EE, embedded, and software) I'll say I have no confidence in a lot of the current big names. A lot of them are just old school businesses applied over the new tech landscape which is fine (amzn is a landlord for websites, Google is magazine adspace for the internet). But a lot of other new shit is evaluated based in perceived future performance that noone can predict. In general knowing what is a current fad and what will still be growing 20 years from now is pretty damn hard. If you asked 10 year old me Pokemon cards were the future and I was damn sure, hell a lot of adults at the time were convinced their beanie baby collection was a solid growth investment. Past history shows us that we are pretty poor at predicting future trends so I don't go long on anything that doesn't have a positive history or doesn't at least have a historical analog. Big data for example I thing is pretty reasonable, intelligence/surveying/market research have been around long enough to where I think that is a prudent call. Also, if you take a traditional viewpoint on newer companies is also a valuable insight. Like looking at Amazon as a real estate company instead of a tech company, their servers are houses and the infrastructure is the neighborhood they are in. I wouldn't invest in a real estate company if house prices were dropping like a rock while rent is at all time highs. Seems like buying at peak market.

Even if your company broke and lay you off, their stonk can still keep raising/trade sideways for years or decades. Do you keep burning cash on this for all these years waiting for the jackpot to hit you?

41,2020-05-04,"I've read their white paper a couple times and I'm no expert on this stuff but I'm not convinced.  I have a few issues with it:

1. They've **only made this indicator for the past 10 years** or so, so it doesn't cover a full cycle; and where there have been big moves, QE has been involved so market signals dont' mean as much as external forces;
2. Based on the chart, it looks like it's signalling major changes a lot of the time (and nothing happens); **it cries wolf often, usually wrongly**;
3. Also, where there are rises/drops that appear to have corresponding rise in DIX, it's not clear whether the DIX leads or follows.  If you download the CSV of data and compare it, you can see that **it follows the S&amp;P more than it predicts it**; 
4. In the white paper it talked a bit about what this thing is, and it mentions somewhere that the calculation includes market cap-weighted volume.  I ran the correlation of DIX vs SPY price \* SPY volume \[the ETF\] and got got a correlation of -0.52.  So that alone explains 52% of it (just using SPY).  We just had big days for the biggest companies (AMZN, AAPL) with volume nearly double what we've been seeing lately, **that alone would make DIX go up** (and yes I did write this whole thing just so I could say that).  I don't know the details of their index but I suspect that going S&amp;P 500-component level would show an even higher correlatin;
5. In dark pools, for every buyer there's also a seller.  So **even if this is where the lizard overlords who control the world do their trading, how do we know if they're buyer or seller**?  I know this is sort of what these guys are trying to get at, with every clear-market trade having a corresponding short on the dark pool etc., and part of the info they're trying to extract is, who has an opinion and who's just acting as market maker \[I admit **I just don't understand how they do this**\].  But assuming they actually can tell who is initiating the trade, **the biggest users of dark pools are pension funds and endowments** etc.  They want to be able to buy/sell 10 million shares without getting eaten alive by pirhanas (HFT's and bots).  But those trades, although they're usually done by very smart people, are often ""dumb money"" because they're moving as required by **asset-class allocation or index-composition** or to pay benefits or buy something else.  So this is not necessarily a behind-the-scenes view of smart money placing bets based on inside info or satellite photos etc., and even if it is, there's no way to know.  If there were a way to know, those smart people would use a different way to trade (or mix it up all the time so nobody knows what they're up to).

One of these days I'll run the correlations at stock-level and make a post on it.  These people are obviously very smart so I'm sure there's a lot I'm missing.

Their GEX indicator is a lot more interesting to me.  To some extent it seems to have the same as 3 above, it predicts what happened earlier today, but things happen in trends so even a real predictor may look like that's all it's doing.  Also, GEX is just the feedback loop create by options hedging; there are other feedback loops, like the ones caused by ETF's or stop loss orders or margin calls.  So it seems to me that when GEX gets relatively small (but still positive), volatility will be amplified.

For word and outlook, companies can use Gmail and google docs if they buy GSuite, but then again that’s just moving money from one big tech to another

A lot of people make bigger plays because of the larger amount and you will lose it; not doubting your trading ability but it’s inevitable to make a small mistake we’re all human. Really happy you already wanna buy properties and I definitely think a crash is coming but maybe not as soon as we’re thinking and, hell, if there isn’t you have 350,000 after tax cash youre sitting on. Buy some properties in your area and maybe in the south where it’s cheap and you can buy a whole neighborhood (yolo). You’re also in a good position to maybe save a lil more and just create your own business in full cash without being in debt. Because congrats, you’re gonna beat the 90% of when shit hits the fan, you owe nothing. Pandemics like now REALLY suck when you got payments to make on a building and you got no money coming in and now PPP is drained. 

Open up a TDA account for stock holding (or any brokerage. (Just something you use to separate it from your options brokerage so you don’t see your shares fluctuate.) I just have a huge bias towards TDA but that’s me. Buy stocks you believe in and when it dips buy more. But only buy an amount that you won’t cash out during an economic uncertainty in your life. This’s a 30 year minimum plan my friend. And, idk if you do or plan to have kids but you’ll be setting them up as well. The cheesy part is go to AAPL and MSFT because well, they don’t fail ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯. I wanna get a ton and hope one day they do a split so it’ll multiply the shares I’d have and just buy more so when it goes back to its pre-split price you’re doin great. I like BIIB a lot and maybe AbbVie. Just strong biotech stuff. DXCM and REGN. Even XOM, while oil’s shitting the fan but long term i feel a correction will happen politically to ease it all,  they’ve been really consistent in paying but however i don’t know about the condition of the current state of them as a company. Still, boomers love it and for good reason. AT&amp;T is a solid stock that every retired person cashed in and uses their dividends. Super reliable. PG have been paying dividends for over 200 years so they’re SUPER safe. Just avoid high yield junk stocks (but use your own DD because of stuff like CCL that got hit SUPER hard and now are at a yield of 15 or so. I don’t think that’ll be forever but apparently the cruise line industry have been in trouble for a while. 

Invest in companies you believe in. Hell, AMZN and BYND don’t pay but they’re solid stocks, I think at least.  I also think SHOP has great potential as well and shit yolo into TSLA shares if you wanna have some balls to handle it’s huge volatility. But everything I’m saying is stuff I believe in. I’m just saying stuff I would say normally and am, by no means, really know what I’m saying here. But yeah, of course the usual blue chips won’t ever hurt and’ll go a long way. I noticed BLK pays 3.00 dollars a dividend and sits at a yield of ~2.8 or so which is crazy good. I regret not buying a lot of shares of BA when it was at 90 or so but c’est la vie. Who wouldn’t wanna buy a part of America’s baby stock? 

I’m tired and have done no research but I’d look into companies that pay well with some research and just look into ones that you believe in and ask yourself why. For income I’d seriously just look into real estate with all being said. The goal is consistency and the whole trading thing is just a Segway into trying to find a way to reach self-sufficiency.

They're hoping the massive markups on these cars will bank huge profits in the coming months. Sales however, are down.

With that said, Carvana may be following the same strategy. That means Carvana may be taking on massive debt with low sales, with the idea of projecting huge profits in the coming earnings later this year.

If there's one thing I know it is that recently earnings don't mean shit (take EA for example) and projections and future earnings are the only things investors care about now (take AMZN for example).

\----  

Look man, It's a pretty simple idea but extremely hard to do in practice and it's called 'deleveraging'. Specifically, a 'beautiful deleveraging' (DALIO). Sure, it means the markets go to kangaroo-land and nothing makes sense any more, but that's kind of the point. Your economy should be fucked, but it isn't. Instead, everyone you know gets to keep their house and their job and their car and food costs pretty much the same and life goes on as normal even if shit gets weird in the markets for a while.  

This is great news unless youre holding spy puts. For everyone who isn't on this sub and is planning to get a job out of college, buy a house or retire; the kind of financial stability that is offered is a good thing and is LITERALLY THE FEDS ONLY REMIT. Fukk ur puts bro. When you're reading this comment, keep in mind that the beautiful deleveraging is extremely easy to fuck up leading to a depression or inflation spiral. 

  

Everyone had too much debt. Everyone. Corporates, Companies, Restaurants, people. By debts I also mean anything that is a promise of payment such as tax on a restaurant's property - Any long term obligation for payment like rent or business tax. All these players get leveraged to the fucking gooch because if you don't you're throwing away growth potential. That's a bubble.  

  

The bubble normally bursts on its own but this year you got the rona because donny boy ignored all fucking logic or sense. In europe we only have ourselves to blame, but that's our political hand grenade and you have yours. Now, business activity globally is fucked and nobody can save it fast enough such that everyone can make their debt payments. Everyone and I mean everyone is leveraged to the tits so if one person misses a payment, it's dominos - but even worse than the fucking pizza.  

  

Enter central banks. The job of the central bank is to unfuck this whole situation in combination with the government even though they should really be independent. In the good times, their job is to not fuck up, in the bad times their job is to stop your life looking like kansas in the wizard of oz before bitch starts trippin. Within their remit should be:: 0. Liquidity 1. Inflation 2. Growth 3. Employment - When they do their job well in a crisis, unemployment is managed because business doesn't collapse. Future growth is improved through capex. Inflation is contolled so the population don't notice it in their daily lives for long, and liquidity is maintained so you don't get massive solvency issues in critical sectors/companies.  

  

If the central bank does their job well (Jeremy+Christine&lt;3 are doing a pretty good job so far) Quality of life doesn't get totally fucked for Joe-10$-Poker-On-The-Weekends. Inflation is contained to somewhat abstract assets such as Gold, Forex, Certain bonds or Equities. Most people don't own these so they might feel left out, but they aren't starving so their complaints are mainly political. The increasing cost of gold might be the only sign that you fucked up your currency - compare EUR, GBP &amp; USD cost of gold in 2009 - Gold went up about 70%ish for all of them meaning the devaluation was simultaneous and none of the normies really noticed. 

The Central bank push for liquidity this cycle is really designed to allow the smooth transition of capital from unproductive assets (REITS, Travel, Hertz Junk debt, +whatever shit you own) into productive assets (BYND, TSLA, AMZN and other meme stocks)  without the system breaking which would fuck 10$-Poker-Joe. Lube up the transition to normal so that Joe who works for F can find a new job in electric cars.   

The money printer is causing inflation, but it isn't causing inflation in *consumer goods*, it is causing inflation in *investor goods* aka equities and shitty bonds. If there is any fucking justice in the world, it will also be moving risk to these assets too - which is to say that those who are bidding up the prices today with free money are also taking on bankruptcy risk for these assets which are inflating (LOL OF COURSE NOT our old buddy Joe takes that risk) .  

Eventually, the free money has to be felt somewhere and it is inevitably the currency. The ussa has an advantage in its reserve status that it has been geopolitically wasting since Rump gained office. IMHO, Amerifags have everything to lose at this point from a macro and foreign policy perspective so I personally am betting against while holding some well-chosen US stocks. I'm currently trying to work out how much UST10y I can short most efficiently with my early research suggesting I can short close to 1,000,000$ of UST10s for about 1500eu. My only problem is that if my bet pays off, the dollar might be so weak that my payoff is decreased. I do feel a bit like Burry trying to work that one out.",learningtosail,wallstreetbets,30.0

33,2020-05-06,"This earning season's reminds me of my first few parties in college.  I was super-excited, had all of the right clothes to wear, and was definitely looking forward to flossing the new-and-improved me.  The first party was definitely cool, as I felt my way around, filled with nervousness and anticipation.  I laughed off the fact I didn't actually go home with a woman that first night, or even get a number, or even talk to a woman, but I had a nice buzz and was prepared for my next shot.   It was kind of like my bet on Dominoes this earning's season, in hindsight it didn't work out, but I had done the research and looked forward to the next round.

The next few parties in college, I began to resent how easy it seemed to be for everybody else to have a good time, and get apparently what I was looking for.  I was beginning to get less and less optimistic, and that initial sense of euphoria and confidence was slowly turning into self-loathing and the feeling of petulance of not belonging there.  As I bet AMZN and MSFT this earnings season, the same feeling became me.  Why didn't I just click on FB instead, why did I blow $1600 on an expiring weekend SPY Put.  None of it makes sense, to anybody.  

Eventually at the end of my freshman year, I realized that parties weren't for me, and maybe I'm just a weirdo.  Maybe earnings aren't for me either, but I could just be broke.  In either event, I have no business being there or here.",Singleguywithacat,wallstreetbets,33.0

44,2020-05-06,"Lately I've heard people describing it as a market in denial, which seems fairly accurate.  There is one important caveat though - the big tech cap stocks have held up and their percentage of the indexes has grown dramatically during this bear market while many sectors remain in bear market or at least correction territory.  


Likely this is a big factor because market participants have yet to price in the possibility of an earnings contraction in big tech - possibly because the surge in activity due to stay at home orders has caused a usage spike that makes them appear a beneficiary.    


This is where a major inefficiency lies.  Advertising budgets (GOOGL, FB), corporate spend (MSFT), and discretionary spending (AMZN, AAPL) will start to dry up in the next few quarters.

55,2020-05-06,"I was in the same boat as you when I started trading in 2017. ""TA is bullshit, it's just a bunch of lines, blah blah blah"". Instead I followed the WSB method:  


1.) Identify company you like

2.) Cherry pick fundamental data to support your argument why it should be higher and ignore the fundamental data that points to a different picture.

3.) Convince others on WSB 

4.) YOLO it all on calls/puts  


I lost my portfolio in the 2018 crash because ""the fundamentals"" didn't support the movements we were seeing and every time I bought puts we'd rally for a week or two before coming back down, but I never really believed in the bear case, so every rally seemed like ""the rally that takes us back to normal"" and I'd get out of puts and back into calls, just in time for the market to take another shit when Donny tweeted.  


Unlike this covid pandemic, tech actually crashed then. Not this bullshit we have now where tech spends all of one week below their 200DMA's. AMZN went from $2000 to $1300, AAPL traded from $230 down to $130. NVDA was cut in half.   


There was no fundamental reason for these pillars of our financial markets to be crashing, but they were doing so all the same. And the reason is simple: trading is psychological. Two people have differing opinions about the value of a stock, so one agrees to buy at price X and one agrees to sell at price X. The actual value of the stock is irrelevant, all that matters is the price of the trade, and the price of the subsequent trade. As long as there are more buyers than sellers, then on average the subsequent trade will occur at a higher price than the previous trade.  


The value of TA is in understanding that humans are psychologically motivated by strange things, and understanding that when those motivations cause enough traders to change their opinions on the value of a stock *at the same time* that it can cause a shift in the ratio of buyers to sellers, which will cause the trend to shift from up to down or down to up, because again, all that matters is the current trade an the subsequent trade.  


So it's important to remember in fall of 2018 that the S&amp;P was pushing up against 3000 for the first time ever. So, while the fundamental analysis wouldn't give a fuck about the 3000 price, TA would remind you that 3000 is an important price because it's a psychological level. There are many people that would be willing to buy the S&amp;P at 2xxx but not 3xxx. Why? Because humans are bad at thinking of things mathematically. 3000 is only one point higher than 2999, which is only one point higher than 2998, but you're likely to lose more buyers going from 2999-3000 then you are going from 2998-2999. More importantly, experienced traders know this, so while they might say ""I'm willing to buy at 3000, but only if the market accepts that price"" what they're really saying is, ""I'm only a buyer at 3000 if the market is buying at 3000, otherwise I'm a seller"". That's fundamentally different than saying ""I'm only a buyer at 3000 if the market is buying at 3000, otherwise I'm neither buying nor selling"".  


So what ends up happening is that at 2990 you have 10 buyers and 2 sellers. At 2995 you have 8 buyers and 3 sellers. At 2999 you have 5 buyers and 4 sellers. At 3000 you have 8 sellers and 2 buyers. And just like that the momentum shifts and that's how prices can act as resistance points.  


In 2018, this resistance of 3000 got compounded with some actual bad news coming out, so it confirmed people's biases that selling at 3000 was a good idea, and instead of having something like 8 sellers and 2 buyers, you had 10 sellers and no buyers. What happens in that case? Price drops until someone is willing to buy, and price can drop very rapidly in that case. That's what happened in 2018. Very quickly there were no buyers to be found, and the market wasted no time in dropping a fuckload.  


So while there was always the possibility that if we had gotten good news around the 3000 level the market would have rallied, we can't predict the news. We also can't predict the markets. All we can do is identify psychological areas of interest, and pay more attention at those areas than at other areas. That's all TA is.  


For example in this current trend, what are the important levels? SPX 3000 (for reasons mentioned above), as well as the fact that it's the 200 day moving average, meaning, on average for the last 200 trading days (approx 1 year, but more importantly everyone that trades uses the 200 day moving average, so it's important because enough people say it is, not because 200 is a magic number).  


Another important level is 2930-2950. Why? Two reasons, first because that area is the 61.8% fibonnaci retracement, which is not an important number for any other reason that **ENOUGH** traders have decided it is an important number and therefore it is a price that has the power to change sentiment, and two, because our last high on 4/29 was at that level. Why is that important? Because of humans ability to recognize patterns, and the two most important patterns in trading are uptrending patterns and downtrending patterns. So what is an uptrend or a downtrend? Simple, an uptrend is a line that moves up and to the right. It can contain periods where the line moves down and to the right, so long as eventually the line goes back up higher than it was before. **If the line no longer goes higher than it was before then you're no longer in an uptrend**, you're either going to the right, or you're going down and to the right (a downtrend). So 2930-2950 is that area where our last top was, and if we are going to continue in an uptrend we need to make a higher high. If we don't make a higher high, then you can zoom out and see that longer term we are in a downtrend, and 2930-2950 would mark the lower high of the larger move downwards.  


The final important level is 2720. Why? The inverse of the reason I described above. As long as the highs are higher we are in an uptrend and as long as the lows are higher we are in an uptrend. If we go lower than 2720, which was our most recent low, then we will have put in a lower low, and we will no longer be in an uptrend. We could be going sideways and then we'll go back into an uptrend, or we could be starting a downtrend, but either way, we'll no longer be in an uptrend. Therefore, it's an important level.  


So TA helps you by saying ""look, stick to your biases and your fundamental analysis and watch the news and pay attention and trade your vibe, but watch these levels because if the momentum is going to shift, it's most likely to happen at these levels"". It gives you a playbook to follow.  


So if I've been bullish since early April when we had our first dip and made a higher low (definition of an uptrend), then I'm still bullish because we haven't made a lower high, or a lower low. But if we go below 2720 we'll have put in a lower low, and at that point I need to be VERY careful because the momentum is likely to shift from bullish to bearish at that point. If we put in a higher high before then, I don't need to worry about 2720, I need to worry about the most recent low (what was it, 2790ish?).  


Hopefully that explains how TA helps. If you still think that all the numbers I mentioned are completely irrelevant random numbers, and you can't understand why those numbers in particular would be important to enough traders that they would base their decisions on those numbers, and if you can't see why enough traders basing their decisions on a group of numbers can impact the movement of the market, then I can't help anymore.",straightCrimpin,wallstreetbets,55.0

It IS based on fundamentals. 

Airlines, Boeing, and cruise are near their March lows. oil (XLE) was too until the supply cuts proved effective, and demand started to pick up. It's still down -50% which seems reasonable given the rally and end year projections of $40/b. Manufacturing is down -40-50%.

You could sell that call for a profit of $5, but if you are bullish you can lock profits by selling a higher strike and still benefit from the spread. Now, imagine that the 2450 price is 12, and you sell this.

Scenario 1: the price doesn’t move, you will keep your profit of $5.
Scenario 2: close to expiration AMZN is more than 2450, you get (12-10+2450-2440)x100=1200
Scenario 3: the price falls, the one you bought might be  worth less than what you paid for but so does the one you sold... this tend to 12-10=2 the closer to the expiration you get.. so your worst case scenario is a profit of $2

So, best case +12, worst case +2.

6,2020-05-09,"P.S - this isn't financial advice. 

The below comment sums it up for me (from an analyst from Cresset Asset Management). If I had a basket of equities and I still want equity in my portfolio, I would concentrate most in the likes of MSFT/AMZN by selling other stocks. In fact, I'm staying invested only in AMZN/MSFT for the long term irrespective of what happens - they will be alive after this crisis and profitable. 

At the end of the day this crisis is a solvency crisis and not a liquidity crisis, and this is where CB are getting it wrong. You will have companies at peak market valuation that will be filing from bankruptcy soon. 

The answer has to be helicopter money where it will help. Helicopter money has to go where it will stimulate trade. That means, to people who can be relied on to buy things. That means, to the poor.
The problem is, the people who decide where to sprinkle it are rich, and the rich don't like giving to the poor.

But hey what do I know - I'm just a small retail investor as many of us are here looking for a piece of the action! Good luck G.

9,2020-05-09,"Oddly enough, I'm now wondering if the Rona will lead to the final boom and bust of the tech stocks as we head towards re-opening the economy.  Here's my retarded thesis that is probably very flawed somehow:

Boom - Some tech companies have acquired new costumers due to the Rona.  Think forced hyper-migration into using them out of necessity.  E-commerce sites like Amazon and Etsy are getting black-friday levels of shopping traffic (or something like that) because retail stores are closed or scary to go to.  Traditional brick &amp; mortar small businesses are attempting to go e-commerce with Shopify.  Paypal reported record transactions on May 1.  All that chatty stuff is being used (Zoom, Snapchat, Facebook) because in-person contact is riskier.  Netflix and Activision Blizzard are there for home entertainment.  And I'm too retarded to understand how cloud businesses like Microsoft, Twilio, Okta, and ServiceNow are benefiting from it, but I guess that's a thing too.

Bust - Here I think is the other side of the coin with all those companies I mentioned above.  Their entire bull run is predicated on growth growth growth (especially the ones that aren't profitable right now).  You see, the stay-at-homey economy has forced a handful of tech-averse holdouts to sign up for and use their services, essentially fast-forwarding their growth (the big boom).  Now with their growth fast-forwarded, they'll hit their total addressable market quicker, and there will be a flattening of their growth curve sooner as they have no new customers left to acquire.  See, COVID-19 forced the most old-fashioned get-off-my-lawn type of people to finally succumb to using their tech products and solutions - and those customers are the end of the line... the final hold-outs... the last remaining untapped market... there are no new customers left to acquire after them and nowhere left to grow bigly.  Added to that, when the economy re-opens, some of those old-fashioned customers may ditch the tech companies' services after essentially being ""forced"" to try them out and failing miserably with them (whether for business or personal use).

And with ""peak growth"" now hit (pussy-ass tiny growth doesn't count), Wall Street will realize that with not much growth left, they will actually have to value tech companies based on (GASP!) PROFITS now, and judge them as very over-valued on that basis.  And so they will turn on the tech stonks, the cloud stonks, and FAGMAN (FB, AMZN, GOOG, MSFT, AAPL, NFLX) since for them it's ""show good growth or GTFO"".  And since FAGMAN is a major market driver, it'll drag the market down with it.

TL;DR - Stonks only go up until FAGMAN and other cloud and tech hit a growth wall (which happens sooner rather than later due to Rona).  Then the music stops.  Also, I'm really fucking stupid, so don't listen to me.",VotedOut,wallstreetbets,9.0

I found that HD and Lowe's are both at **all time highs** for search interest, with trends since February comparable to Corona plays like Netflix and Amazon, except more linear.  It's worth noting that unlike those stocks, HD and Lowe's haven't yet recovered or exceeded their pre-virus prices, although they have had a bit of a run-up today and Friday.


&gt;[Home Depot and Lowe's have seen a steady, sharp increase in search activity since March](https://i.imgur.com/1YAZ8zK.png).  In fact it appears to be an all-time high, even more than the holiday season.  And HD/Lowe's are pretty insulated from the Amazonification of shopping- a lot of their stuff is convenience based, or bulky items, or stuff you want to check out in person.

&gt;[Compare to the CV19 All-Star stocks Amazon and Netflix, along with Wal-Mart to compare to Amazon as a retailer](https://i.imgur.com/H1F4Kn7.png), there is a similar but more linear uptick for the home improvement stores.  And AMZN/NFLX/WMT stocks are at all-time highs.

&gt;[Etsy, Ebay, and Wayfair have seen upticks in search activity similar to the hardware/home improvement stores](https://i.imgur.com/lO7oop7.png).  (Side note, in contrast to these, Poshmark took a severe hit during the onset of the outbreak- used clothing not so hot during a virus outbreak I guess- although a recovery seems to be underway). However, their stocks have mostly already recovered their pre-corona prices.  Still some room to run possibly, if you think the landscape has permanently changed in their favor.  eBay especially has potential to challenge Amazon in online retail if they can get on the right track.

&gt;Just for comparison to Wayfair, HD, and Lowe's- [nobody much cares about Bed Bath and Beyond right now](https://i.imgur.com/wBXgwgt.png), which is just as well since their stores are closed. 

&gt;&gt;*4/28 addendum*: Actually as it turns out, BBBY released strong online sales increases and skyrocketed yesterday, and is now up about 30% since Friday.  On that note, there is a small uptick in the search activity for Bed Bath Beyond. That could represent growth in online sales. If so, as HD and Lowe’s have much larger upticks I wonder if that could also be pointing in part to strengthening online sales, which the markets seem to love.

&gt;Bottom line, the hardware/home improvement stores are tracking the hot internet stocks in terms of search interest and anecdotal feet through the doors, yet their valuations have lagged.  I wonder if the markets are overweighting the loss of construction business.  This could present an opportunity for HD/Lowe's to surprise at earnings, which is really what an earnings play is all about.

&gt;Positions: 

&gt;HD 6/19 220c, 245c

&gt;LOW 6/19 110c, 125c

Iron Condor is neutral on a stock, so I look at the naked straddle as a sanity check. Right now you are looking at a $63 premium for that, on a $2377 stock. Break even is $2440/$2314. It was way below that earlier in the week. I just don’t like it.",seattle_exile,wallstreetbets,24.0

2,2020-05-09,"Here instead of me writing out a bunch of shit check out Bert Hochfeld &amp; Beth Kindig's research. Can find on seek alpha or their websites... They do great tech research on this area of the market. 

So the reaction in these stocks is based in the narrative behind them. With software the name of the game is rule of 40. If your growth slows before you can be profitable its lights out. FEYE ZUO BOX CLDR DBX... The market gives &gt;30x sales values to some and 1x sales to others. BOX competes with the largest cloud providers &amp; has growth problems &amp; is not profitable. It's all over. The bet now is can they turn it around. 

TWLO is the exact opposite. People were worried organic growth was slowing &amp; they havent turned to total profitability yet. Last quarter the narrative changed when they beat &amp; raised by a huge margin. So the stock rushed higher because it was mispriced. When the narrative changes on something you get powerful moves like this. Just like TSLA. I think SQ is going to go through this but so does everyone. 

CRM is a value play in cloud. But directly related to retail so there's way more risk in CRM than all others. 

I wouldnt recommend something necessarily but if you model these $ESTC has the highest probability of pulling a TWLO IMO. A company with sustained 50% growth, 72% gross margins, 0% cash flow &amp; -20% op margins should be valued higher than 10x sales. CRWD will sustain 50% growth on 71% gross margins, 10% cash flow (but growing CF much faster than ESTC), ~ -10% op margins &amp; is valued at over 20x sales. TWLO trades at 17xish sales on 50ish% growth &amp; 50% gross msrgins at 1.6B scale. I could go on with the comparisons to similar growth rate &amp; gross margin companies RNG CRWD DDOG TWLO DT... Go do the DD, compare forward year growth rate, cash flow margin/op margin, gross margin with the multiple the market gives the stocks. 

The narrative on ESTC is that is an 'elastic' open source platform used mainly for observability (logging tracing APM API security) by big tech. NFLX Airbnb LYFT UBER all use ESTC infrastructure. At this moment ESTC ia going through a huge change &amp; this is why I believe ESTC has the highest probability of pulling a TWLO &amp; rallying to new highs. 

1. Sentiment on the stock is nonexistent due to its lack of stock performance, the CEO not going on CNBC, and the company not being widely known - its yet another fast growing software company, what do we do with it? What multiple do we assign? &gt;30x sales like DDOG? Or 10x sales which is like the penalty box for cloud multiples. The lack of sentiment could create a huge opportunity in future
2. ESTC leverages open source search to process raw NoSQL data, observe digital operations, etc. It recently acquired an endpoint security company that it has integrated into its stack FOR FREE. This competes in a huge market. The idea is to give away endpoint security to incentive buying the largest package from the company - you need to secure all endpoints so they argue security should be integrated into observability, in fact they basically say that logging &amp; security overlap entirely. 
3. They are suing AMZN for forking their code with stolen code. ESTC is big in the open source community &amp; the community seems to not tolerate code stealing. I'm not a programmer so Im not entirely sure whats going on but this could be positive for AMZN as customers move off AWS' copy of ESTC to ESTC. In fact ESTC seems to be giving away the security software to beed up their offering to get the conversion from AWS.
4. COVID likely will see demand for observability go up due to increase in online traffic. More people watch NFLX so theyre making more recommendations using ESTC. 
5. If ER May 20 proves that COVID benefits ESTC the narrative will change QUICKLY. People will start to dig at whats going on. If an analyst asks if they are taking from AWS then that will be in play. Likewise when the market realizes how they are positioned in cybersecurity it will add to the sentiment on the stock. When sentiment changes hedge funds buy and stock is adding un cloud ETFs. Passive investing starts buying and youre golden. 

In fact, ZS has rallied so much partially because it is so big in HACK etf &amp; CLOU SKYY etfs. If ZS doesnt kill it they will be punished as the rise has been due to headlines &amp; nothing real as of yet.",cancelmyfamily,wallstreetbets,2.0

I think the only positive here is that’s it’s not ‘priced in’ due to some lingering bearish sentiment so even a slight improvement in earnings results could make the stock run high.  

On the flip side, the more mixed outlook means we might not get as much IV again before earnings. Maybe if you can get enough gain before to cover investment it’s worth while leaving some to see through the actual earnings.

Lastly, I think a straddle might make SOME sense because if they fail to meet expectations I don’t see it not falling a bit at least.

Basically, I don't spend a lot of time on either AMZN or whatever the fuck uber ticker is.  Basically, you're buying the growth story. That's been Amazon all along- they just keep devouring new markets.

History isn't so kind to the megalomaniac conglomerate. But they can have their day.- I work in an industry where, when there's a bull market, companies get stupid as fuck and trade quality for growth/size (we're detached from the tech/mainstream stock market- it's natural resource commodities).

It's eerily similar to Amazon- in that ""Hey, we're just gonna grow at the expense of quality, but that will return someday."" But then the market turns, and there's a bloodbath. It's not a perfect analogy, as commodities are very different. But the growth over quality story- that transcends most industries- and is generally a bad deal for investors over a longer horizon.

Especially the gargantuan size of something like Amazon. It could break under it's own weight, eventually.

Edit: fucking Uber- I'm pretty much not sold on them. Ever. I  remember some hot-shit finance douchebag from Boston telling me at a yacht race ""Uber's going to be a $200B company."" That was May 2015.  I'm wearing the fucking red hat Mount Gay Rum from that douchey yacht race right now- cause I can't get a fucking haircut-  rockin it  like a douchebag that I may be.

Pets.com/Chewy.com seem like they can eventually be profitable. I feel America is a little slower for online shopping. But that's because we have such a big land mass, logistics is harder and costly.

AMC has a couple billion in negative equity if you disregard the goodwill from their past M&amp;A. They lost 150 mil in 2019. Their leases had negative balance sheet value at the end of last year. That was all BEFORE COVID-19. If you want to think about the future, ""Trolls World Tour"" just made more direct-to-streaming than Universal expected it to make in theaters before the pandemic (and AMC's CEO threw a hissy fit in response and said they wouldn't show Universal movies any more). And AMC just issued $500 million in debt at &gt;10% interest a few weeks ago, with the first interest payment due in October.

Even if AMZN and the studios could have theaters at all, they wouldn't want all the liabilities at AMC. They would wait for it to go Chapter 11 and then either bid on the leases, or watch AMC go completely out of business and then negotiate their own cut-rate deals with the landlords (who will also be desperate at that point).

You can also have a random one that still beats earnings, but plummets for whatever reason and fucks you, see AMZN, MSFT, and DBX (although these have all recovered mostly if you just held).

Then you worry you might have been wrong.

No worries, just buy stuff in the red and hope it goes green.

Then start worrying you were wrong.

Search through yahoo finance, they have a ton of great stuff. Also stocktwits on what salm10 and others have to say.

Also check the news for upcoming things and what insiders say.

Then start worrying that you were wrong.

1. Post a blog post on Reddit with buzzwords like ""provision"", ""technical"", ""processes"", etc. 
2. Say msft/amzn/aapl/fb will buy it out and it will be announced on a certain day this week.
3. Get in while you can!
4. End if with ""this is just my own DD, do your. Own Dunkin Donuts"" at the end so it doesn't look like Im fishing.

Then start worrying that might not work.

* Chart support and resistance.
* Check and note any patterns evident in recent days/weeks and note any future patterns that started or are close to fully developing.
* Note EMA, VWAP and any other things relevant on a chart
* Note important things like float, short float%, volume and RSI.
* Scan SEC for relevant info, note cash on hand, debt, Q and Y revenue, dilution, notes, etc
* Check for news, earnings, PR, online buzz
* Plan out your strategy for the trade according to whether its short, swing, long.

Now you know you were wrong. Try to understand why.

At the computer for 10 hours doing DD and only make it through like 3 companies.

This is the lesson to learn. Also always buy 2-4 months out and sell 2 months before expiry so you don't get theta and option will always have some sort of time value so you don't go to 0.  also the most money I've lost has been options on earnings it's at aight gambling don't do it.

31,2020-06-05,"We need a sticky with this explanation because it is hard to learn yourself.  I got a few minutes until my test this afternoon, so I’ll dump on ya.

Expiry:  Closer expiry is higher risk, higher reward.  Opposite goes for long expiry.  

Strike: Closer ATM strike is lower risk and more expensive, and far OTM either direction is higher risk.

Depending on what you’re current hypothesis for short term or long term moves is, any combination is a good strategy.  I’ll run through a few quick examples.

1 week expiry far OTM strike (10% or more).  This means a strike of 55 or higher on a stock that is at 50 now.  1 week expiry would be 6/12 today.  This would be very very high risk.  On most stocks these options should be under 1.00, now stocks with high volatility and high share prices could be higher (think TSLA, AMZN, CMG).  This is because for those stocks a 1% move could be essentially 8 to 24 points of strike which, depending on delta could be 500 to 1500 dollars.  Most stocks though are around 10 to 150 dollars a share.  Higher share price stock options don’t really get super low.  Anyway, I digress.  1 week 10% OTM should be very cheap because it is unlikely they got ITM.  However, see the individual on the front page who made 6000% on AAL calls.  He did that because against very high odds, his far OTM options went deep ITM.  Most of these though will expire worthless.  

1 week to expiry (FDs) ATM: this means the strike is 51 or 49 on a 50 stock.   Also pretty high risk however these can be short term traded with good profits.  1% to 3% moves of the underlying (the stock they follow) can move them 20% to 150% depending on initial volatility.

1 month far OTM:  These can be good,  it’s mixture of high risk on the strike and lower risk on the expiry.  I would still not hold these long.  You want to hold for one big move close to when you buy and then dump.  

1 month ATM:  These are great.  Good mixture of risk and reward.  These will not got to 0 tomorrow unless the stock dumps 5% or something ridiculous.  Where as all the ones I’ve listed above can drop 50% in a day fairly easily.  It is very unlikely to lose more than 20% on these in a day.  However that does inverse that it is unlikelt to gain more than 10 to 30% in a day.  Now of course when the underlying moves like BA or AAL these last two days, you’re still looking at 200 to 500% gains or more. 

3 month ATM/ far OTM.  This is the first expiry I’d actually recommend you go OTM.  If you’re going this far out, buying ATM doesn’t make a whole lot of sense.  At this level of risk you might as well just buy 3x leverage ETFs instead of ATM.  For OTM you’re gonna see good gains as you get closer and go ITM.  These are good for companies you have a good short term outlook on but aren’t sure exactly when they’ll take off.  You won’t lose a huge amount of money if these go from 3 months out 10% OTM to 2 months out 7% OTM.  

LEAPs.  Don’t buy ATM leaps, just don’t.  Very expensive and just why?  Large risk for much smaller movements with the underlying.  These are for people who don’t feel like timing the market but want to time a large move? Very contradictory really.

Okay so, what do I recommend?  One month ATM.  These are going to move at 5x or so the speed of the underlying.  Unless you let the stock move completely against you, you won’t lose all your money.  Don’t be greedy.  Sell when you’re 5% to 25% up until you’re more experienced.  Don’t make plays just to make plays. 

Don’t make plays just to make plays.  Don’t make plays just to make plays.  I’ll say it one more time for the retards on this sub just buying shit everyday they barely understand.  Don’t make plays just to make plays.

If you can’t let you’re money sit on the sidelines while you craft a hypothesis you are just gambling.  I mean, we are all just gambling really, but that’s just directionless money burning.",justafish25,wallstreetbets,31.0

2,2020-06-08,"10-15 years is still time for some aggressive growth.  Basically create your own mini mutual fund without the fees and dipshits picking your stocks based upon who takes them to a strip club and gets a picture of them with coke and a hooker.

Put 1/2 in 10 tested and true american stocks, actual proven revenues, cash on hand and diversify a tad.  so 175k split with something like:

ie. DIS, AMZN, MSFT, MCD, BA, DAL, WMT, BAC, MGM, UNH

Put 1/4 in foreign stocks, primarily Asia (dont be worried about delisting, its a myth and this is where you will see biggest returns)

ie. BABA, JD, PDD, HUYA, NOK, XNET, etc.

I'd do longer term options with the last 1/4.  Sell at 20% loss and cash out at 100% gain.  This way a 25% hit rate will gain you 25%.  Try 3 mo. to 12 mo. options, either put or call, set a stop loss at 20%, set a gain at 100% and if you don't let diamond hands or emotions run trades, you will be suprised at how you can probably outpreform anything else.  I'll never understand the affinity for shit like 1 week or less options....You can buy options out 3 months that almost gain the same in a 1 week period without the IV crush or just not guessing correctly that week.  Bought lots of options 3 months out that lost the first week and killed it in weeks 2-4.  300% gains on 3 month out options are better than losing everything first week or the 10000% less chance of gaining 500%.  Worst case, its not going your way, sell after 2 weeks for like a 20% loss.  Can do that 14x, get your 300% hit, and still make money.",typicaluswhitemale,wallstreetbets,2.0

100,2020-06-08,"I know it feels like you're missing out on am awesome bull market (and you are), but there's always more opportunity in the future.

If I dumped every penny I had in my brokerage account, I'd be about 60% of your account - not small, not huge. Here's what I have learned about my trading by reviewing my wins and losses:

I almost always lose on big (25k+) plays and win on small (&lt;5k) plays. On the big plays, I'll see a few thousand loss, lose confidence, and bail out. On small plays, I'll see a much bigger % loss, be confident in my thesis, and hold for gains.

I lose almost all my day trades, win almost all trades I hold at least a week. 

Tight stop losses almost always trigger for me. Setting a 2% stop loss in this market is basically a guarantee of a 2% loss - stocks trade up and down 2% a day all the time in this market. Don't buy if you're not confident enough in your research to look at a 2% loss and know it's fine, it'll go back up. Or buy less, risk less (per play). 

I am about 50/50 on bought options, and 95/5 wins on sold options. Check out r/thetagang and read up on selling cash secured puts - it's a great way to make some money while waiting on a good entry point to a stock you like.

I'm up about 9% on SPY, up an average of 20% on shares in individual companies (even though I bought into spy earlier in the bull run). Individual companies are better than etfs for me when I do the research.

EDIT: I forgot an important one - I have seen my best returns on long dated (120+DTE) calls. Every time I buy options with less than 30DTE, I lose

There are lots of good sectors/companies that are still trading at 40% or more under ATH, so don't just look at FAANG. Not saying FAANG is overvalued, just that it feels a lot safer to invest in something like USFD, XOM, BA, JPM that's still well under ATH vs buying into AMZN or TSLA (or etfs like QQQ) hoping it continues to moon well over ATH.",TJnova,wallstreetbets,100.0

Hello Everyone, 

Before we begin. I bought 400 shares of IZEA at $0.66 and sold 100 shares at $2.15.  So you all know what I have so you know it is literally good for me if you buy IZEA so make your decisions accordingly.


Ok so for IZEA - the reason I got in initially was because I saw someone here say it was good, then I searched on twitter and saw some more info, then I saw something interesting. 


I saw their CEO post a countdown for Friday.  - I figured this was a good enough reason to get a little bit in for hype alone 

Then news came of securing funding from a Fortune 500 company.  I would post link but idk if I can in the rules.  We don’t know who yet but the assumption is we find out Friday. 

This stock is a penny stock, it trades low and rides hype waves such as XSPA and GNUS.  Want y’all to know what to expect.   I would almost guarantee that this stock sees more growth before Friday. I’ve literally put money on the line to prove it.  I don’t give any info after Friday because frankly I don’t know shit beyond this Friday. 


Bullish Rumors: the Stocks partnership is with Amazon and Everyone with a robinhood account knows that AMZN has a lot of eyes on it. If they announce partnership we could see a moonshot like NKLA 


Bearish rumors:  it’s up 200% in 24 hours so how much higher could it go. 



**TL:DR. FRIDAY COUNTDOWN ON TWITTER POSSIBLE FORTUNE 500 COMPANY (Amazon) is the investor**

&gt; 09:32 AM EST, 01/26/2018 -- FedEx said Friday that it will spend more than $3.2 billion in wage and benefits increases for employees and for capital investments as a result of the recently enacted tax reform law.

&gt; The amount includes $200 million in increased compensation, a $1.5 billion contribution to its pension plan, and $1.5 billion to expand the FedEx Express Indianapolis hub over the next seven years.

The other cause was Amazon and their push to parcel delivery.

&gt;Fed (FDX -1.7%) and UPS (UPS -2.4%) are tracking lower after Capital Forum reports that Amazon (AMZN +1%) is considering a stronger move into parcel delivery.

&gt;Amazon is reportedly asking shipping platforms to add it as an option alongside USPS, FedEx and UPS before the end of this year (per Bloomberg).

These were the initial cause of the downtrend; however, they weren't enough to cause the continued drop in share price over the two years. So what caused the continued downtrend? Net Income mainly. It's been dropping QoQ consistently. And it went negative with their Feb 2020 earnings report.

**""Ok great, so that explains why it's been going down, but why is it positioned to go up?""**

Well, for one, they are showing major restructuring to improve their sagging earnings. Just last week they announced surcharges on deliveries. Now to some this may seem like Fedex isn't making enough shipments and needs the additional revenue. However, this is an extremely bullish announcement. FedEx is increasing fees because they are trying to manage a surge of packages flowing through its network. Classic supply and demand. They can't keep up with the current demand so they can raise prices to bring demand in line with their supply restraints.

Not convinced their up to the nines in net deliveries? Read this:

To highlight from an employee post on reddit, \*""During peak season, you can always look forward to the sweet month of January. Now, while operating at peak levels, I don't see any reason for it to return to normal anytime soon. I'm nearing the end of my rope here, might start looking into other jobs.""\*

They are operating at holiday levels continually. They are absolutely crushing the COVID-19 environment. Want another example?

&gt;""The weeks ending 3/14 we saw an uptick in business, about 8%. At that point though it was pretty much business as usual and the increase could have been attributed to a lot of things, such as spring break. The following week ending 3/21 business was pretty much identical to the previous week. This was the week that much of the world was going into lock down, and the US was just starting to.

&gt;The next week ending in 3/28 we saw a nearly 20% increase in our business as state shutdowns had begun. Remember, my state hadn't and the county we service hadn't issued safer at home until Friday.

&gt;The next week ending 4/3 saw another nearly 20% increase to our business. Toward the end of this week and the beginning of the following my boss started interviewing and hiring which was frankly a fairly quick reaction.


&gt;The next 2 weeks business stabilized. However, the following week ending 4/24, we shot up another 13%. Within a 5 week period the business had increased it's volume of stops by 54%. Now remember, we had already seen a slight increase in volume to begin March anyway.

&gt;As of last week ending 5/8, our business has seen a roughly 60% increase in stop count from those first inklings that the country was going to effectively shut down in the middle of March. The increase from the beginning of March before this pandemic really took hold of the country is actually more like 80%.""



Great. So we know that they are massively going to crush revenue.



**What about the recent runup? Why should I still buy calls on a company that has seen a 50%+ gain on their stock since the March low?**

Yes, they are recovering like the rest of the market. But they never should have experienced the decline like the rest of the market. Why would a delivery company go down during a pandemic where shipping is the only way to deliver items business to consumer? It wouldn't. It was on the B2B side that caused the downturn. Less business activity would bring less B2B shipments. However, many of those contracts still are paying with/without B2B shipments. Return on Equity will be positive this quarter - and with a lower equity value due to share price, the percentage is going to be fairly substantial.

So what's the play(s)?

FDX has their earnings report on 6/30. IVs on their options are still low. I'd expect FDX to climb to 160 prior to earnings. If you just want to play the runup go ahead - but I think earnings surprise is going to be massive. Their revised estimates have actually lowered and the general consensus is that they will have an EPS much lower YoY. Expected YoY growth is -40.41%. It's going to be positive and the stock price is going to absolutely soar. I'm talking 10%+ on 7/1. Possibly even 2018 levels by end of July. I'd expect 175 on the conservative side and 190 on the upside for 7/17.

There's two ways to play this. The safe play is to buy FDX 1/15/21s 160C. I don't see any possible way this won't make money - unless Amazon announces the purchase of 100+ planes. It'll be my set it and forget it position. The rest will go into 7/17 160Cs and 7/17 170Cs. The 160s cost 2.40 each and the 170s are 1 each. With my conservative estimate, we'll see the 7/17 160s print \~400% returns and the 7/17 170s print \~500%.

**TLDR;**

40% FDX 1/15/21 160C

30% FDX 7/17/20 160C

It is a remote collaboration tool that allows people to effectively work together, access hundreds of thousands of critical applications and services, and find important information to do their best work. Last week they reported solid earnings, with Revenue jumped 50% from year-ago levels, and the company reported adding 12,000 new paying customers. More than 90,000 organizations signed on with Slack on either a paid or free plan during the three months ending April 30. The number of organizations paying $100,000 or more to Slack in annual recurring revenue rose by nearly half to 963. It also sees the good times continuing. The company projects full-year revenue growth of 36% to 38%.

Despite these solid reports, the company dropped 16%.

Investors in Slack should be proud of the company’s performance. According to management, the firm did extremely well in what was the first quarter of its 2021 fiscal year. Based on the data provided, revenue at the firm came in at $201.65 million. This represents a gain of 49.6% over the $134.82 million the firm generated the same quarter a year earlier. Such a high growth rate, particularly for a firm with a market capitalization of $22.4 billion before reporting the news, is difficult to come by. Currently the stock is severely undervalued and will probably rebound very quickly before hedge funds and smart money rebalance and pump this to the fucking moon.

As many of you know, $WORK is, in essence, a replacement for email. It is a remote collaboration tool that allows people to effectively work together, access hundreds of thousands of critical applications and services, and find important information to do their best work. Last week they reported solid earnings, with Revenue jumped 50% from year-ago levels, and the company reported adding 12,000 new paying customers. More than 90,000 organizations signed on with Slack on either a paid or free plan during the three months ending April 30. The number of organizations paying $100,000 or more to Slack in annual recurring revenue rose by nearly half to 963. It also sees the good times continuing. The company projects full-year revenue growth of 36% to 38%.

UNFI will trade close to 80-100 in a year as they delever down to a single revolver and refinance anything existing in the meantime- asset sales will just be the cherry on top. It’s a phenomenal business and a recession proof one. Also EPS missed by a penny as they added some incremental cost due to Covid. That will fall off in time. This isn’t the old debt laden UNFI of the past. I wouldn’t be surprised if AMZN took a second look at vertically integrating them given the Whole Foods relationship they service.

All are looking a bit extended beyond the 4 day so I mainly trimmed and took any/all profits today. They may digest tomorrow. I do a bit of scrapping when I have the time... For example, at one point I had bought puts on AMZN today and watched it fall 20pts and sold for a profit by watching RSI, VWAP, and when QQQs showed back strength. I then switched over to calls and rode it back up. Ive stayed away from most ETFs and usually just use them as references to look at sector trends (SPY, QQQ, IWM, XLF, XLE, JETS). BETZ is a new ETF that I’m long in once Sports gets back online. It can also use it as a reference for GAN and DKNG. 

For options remaining, I only have GLD and SLV...  I bought them two days ago expecting Powell to cause it to spike once he talks about zero-interest rates. Commodities are tricky so sold 80% at EOD.

As many of you know, $WORK is, in essence, a replacement for email. It is a remote collaboration tool that allows people to effectively work together, access hundreds of thousands of critical applications and services, and find important information to do their best work. Last week they reported solid earnings, with Revenue jumped 50% from year-ago levels, and the company reported adding 12,000 new paying customers. More than 90,000 organizations signed on with Slack on either a paid or free plan during the three months ending April 30. The number of organizations paying $100,000 or more to Slack in annual recurring revenue rose by nearly half to 963. It also sees the good times continuing. The company projects full-year revenue growth of 36% to 38%.

Despite these solid reports, the company dropped 16%.

Investors in Slack should be proud of the company’s performance. According to management, the firm did extremely well in what was the first quarter of its 2021 fiscal year. Based on the data provided, revenue at the firm came in at $201.65 million. This represents a gain of 49.6% over the $134.82 million the firm generated the same quarter a year earlier. Such a high growth rate, particularly for a firm with a market capitalization of $22.4 billion before reporting the news, is difficult to come by. Currently the stock is severely undervalued and will probably rebound very quickly before hedge funds and smart money rebalance and pump this to the fucking moon. This morning Motley just posted two articles on $WORK, Investors Observer released improved price targets for $WORK, and the legendary David Hynes is asking you to get into a threesome and start Fucking $WORK in its ass!

I started at the 2 SD range and then moved it to the 3 SD range, looking at STONKS that have mooned or tanked recently to see if there was any trade possible.

If something tanked 3 SD below the mean, then they would most likely pop.. if something mooned 3 SD above the mean, they would likely drill

If history serves, LULU should tank 50-60% of their current high sometime in the next 2-3 years. However, because 2020 is running on SPEEDFORCE! I went in on 12/18 $145p

Will it hit? Probably not, but they were cheap and way the fuck out there. Maybe LULU drops to the $200 range by years end, either way, these will be worth more than the $1.80 I dropped on them

Based on this shitty TA and a lot of glue sniffing, I don't see further upside to LULU

A V means in the next 3 weeks you're all the way back up where you left off. Maybe NASDAQ is close to a V but that's just 5 companies. 5 companies is not the fucking economy. All those dorks hiding inside their homes working for MSFT and AMZN and shit need the rest of the world to also thrive in order for them to have someone to sell their products to.

Fucking retards. That blonde from CNBC is so fucking dumb. She's like obsessed with ""V shaped recovery"". It's like playing a fucking broken record.

V shaped recovery means by end of April we should have been BACK THE FUCK UP. Not just the stock market, but the economy too. By now we should have all been out there at fucking concerts rubbing our cocks and ginas against each other.

25,2020-06-11,"My thoughts on it: They did price in that risk, and then greedy Boomers, millennials / gen Zers with stimulus checks threw it at the market, greedy MMs continued to prop it up, unlimited QE and nightly PPP forced upward movements overnight where 99% of the market does not participate in the action. We've collectively deluded ourselves into believing things are going for a V or swoosh recovery because prices were effectively forced upward. I mean christ futures ended green 10 sessions in a row. Bankrupt companies are doubling daily, Pennystocks are going up 100% in a day, bad earnings are bought to the moon, unemployment is bullish, riots are bullish, nothing can stop ""Stocks Only Go Up"".

It's like putting your best hoe out there every day and shootin her full of coke so she can keep going. But after 2 weeks without eating or sleeping, her fuckin' teeth are falling out and skin is sagging. Gotta let her fuckin' rest. Markets don't go straight up, this shit is full of baloney and has been for at least a month, IMO longer. There is no logical reason companies should be trading at 6000 to 10000 P/E, or really for any of this shit. Red markets right now are a shot of reality before stimulus, FOMO, and market manipulation can come in and prop that shit up.

COVID is just the straw that broke the bitch's back, we were waaaay overbought and overpriced before any of this shit happened. Yield curve inverted months before COVID was even a thing. All bull runs come to an end eventually, and putting strings on this shit like its Weekend at Bernie's does nothing but shield our eyes from the fact that these are zombie companies that have no business being as valuable as they are. Tech is also part of the problem, but at least there is some logical reason if you're looking 30 years in the future for why AMZN, AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, FB, etc. are trading where they are. But there's a lot of shit that's been trading super high that is effectively a high-stakes game of financial market hot potato.

149,2020-06-11,"Hello fellow autists,

Many of you know me as the $DOCU preacher, who stuck his mighty COCKU into $DOCU last week and pulled out after massive 4x returns. (\~$40k in total profit). If your father's son is looking to wank himself off for the coming few months, I am presenting a new opportunity!

(*caution: This post will contain ideas that are for not suited for the faint in heart, but rather targeting autists who wish to earn a FUCKING PROFIT!)*

As many of you know, $WORK is, in essence, a replacement for email. It is a remote collaboration tool that allows people to effectively work together, access hundreds of thousands of critical applications and services, and find important information to do their best work. Last week they reported solid earnings, with Revenue jumped 50% from year-ago levels, and the company reported adding 12,000 new paying customers. More than 90,000 organizations signed on with Slack on either a paid or free plan during the three months ending April 30. The number of organizations paying $100,000 or more to Slack in annual recurring revenue rose by nearly half to 963. It also sees the good times continuing. The company projects full-year revenue growth of 36% to 38%.

Despite these solid reports, the company dropped 16%.

Investors in Slack should be proud of the company’s performance. According to management, the firm did extremely well in what was the first quarter of its 2021 fiscal year. Based on the data provided, revenue at the firm came in at $201.65 million. This represents a gain of 49.6% over the $134.82 million the firm generated the same quarter a year earlier. Such a high growth rate, particularly for a firm with a market capitalization of $22.4 billion before reporting the news, is difficult to come by. Currently the stock is severely undervalued and will probably rebound very quickly before hedge funds and smart money rebalance and pump this to the fucking moon. This morning Motley just posted two articles on $WORK, Investors Observer released improved price targets for $WORK, and the legendary David Hynes is asking you to get into a threesome and start Fucking $WORK in its ass!

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/first-time-canaccord-buy-rating-231519661.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/first-time-canaccord-buy-rating-231519661.html)

Besides the fact that $WORK has plenty of room to consolidate growth with its SaaS potential, it's also beginning to form some monstrous partnerships with other tech giants like IBM and AMZN.

193,2020-06-11,"Yeah ofc, the markets went up because the consensus has been buy. That doesn’t *necessarily* mean they think the stock market is worth more. Bonds have become less attractive and money supply is up. 

Is AMZN going to generate significantly greater eps from a low risk-free rate? Probably not. Is it worth more to an investor in his 50s planning for retirement that wants more than the 0.66% the ten year treasury is offering? Absolutely it is

After factoring for that I’d say we haven’t recovered half of the dip (pure speculation with no maths so take that as a throwaway ballpark amount). The point is that sometimes there is a disconnect between intrinsic value and market value. 

Investors selling thinking a sell off is coming from other scared investors becomes a self fulfilling prophesy and is basically how every sharp decline happens.

200,2020-06-11,"Nah man it would take like 2 weeks. The fake money coins could be liquidated and moved to my bank account in like 3-5 days, but my long term stock portfolio it takes forever to sell, then the funds take several days to be released, once I bought $3k of TWLO because it was skyrocketing and a week later it had made enough that I wanted to sell, and it took a full 11 days before the funds showed up as available to invest, and another 2 days to be able to withdraw.

I fucked up and started buying stock on Stash a few years ago since it was just like $5-10 every week since I was just a broke college student, and then when I started a different career where I made more money and it started being deposits of hundreds of dollars a week I was already in too deep.

The idea is good in my opinion, as I've built up to having 15k in the account, but there are stocks like TSLA, BABA, AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, ZM, etc in there that move big and 2 weeks from now I'm pretty confident they will all be much higher.

Maybe I could do it one stock at a time, where I sell, for example, my 2 shares of tesla, then while waiting for the money to clear I move $2k from my bank account into Robinhood right away. I don't have 15k in my pocket that I could move. 

If it only took 2 or 3 days I wouldnt even question jt.

Also, be careful hoping on that job. Everyone went to college so now everyone has a degree, making them less valuable individually and meaning you won't earn like that position might have before unless you're a doctor or lawyer or engineer or something.

For example, my work has absolutely 0 to do with my degree.

11,2020-06-13,"Thanks for the link. I'll read it. 

Yea  there's two components for the market maker to consider. 

1. The initial delta hedge of the options (which I guess they are ""front running"" as you describe it)

2. The delta hedging coming from gamma as time passes by (factoring in charm or delta decay)

The first one will have an effect on stocks that have a distorted  option delta to share delta. This could apply to airlines and cruises possibly or Tesla, but it won't apply to like SPY or AMZN or AAPL. So I agree with the posts there if they are referring to like airlines or something similar. For example, today and really lately, a lot of the airline moves occur pre market. 

The second part is how we can get large moves from ""artificial delta"" resulting from gamma.",Randomness898,wallstreetbets,11.0
12,2020-06-13,"You can buy absurdly in the money calls (legit you can buy $800 AMZN calls, option price is almost = stock price). But the option price value still won’t move up or down unless the stock moves! (Options are a derivative of the underlying asset: the stock equity). So if you buy and sell immediately, you won’t make any money and you’ll probably (definitely...especially on RH) lose some to the bid-ask spread. Hope that helps.",frontflip98,wallstreetbets,12.0

406,2020-07-01,"Call debit spread is purchasing a lower strike and selling a higher strike. You pay a net debit which is the max loss. If it dips, you will lose, but not as much as just having purchased a call. This is because if both options expire worthless, the call you sold will buffer the amount paid for the more expensive call. 


DEBIT Spreads always involve purchasing the more expensive option and selling a cheaper option, thus paying a net DEBIT.


CREDIT Spreads always involve selling the more expensive option and buying the cheaper option, thus receiving a CREDIT.


Theta and IV also play a big role in both of those. Generally speaking, both debit and credit spreads are theta positive assuming both are in profit zones, meaning as time goes on, you gain more and more of your profit potential. 


For example, I think AMZN will stay flat or go up, so I short an OTM put credit spread. It has a high probability of profit, but low risk-to-reward ratio. Likewise, if I am confident AMZN will go down, I would get an ATM or slightly OTM put debit spread, hoping that AMZN will go down as time goes on and hope it breaches my estimated short strike.

My problem with current tech, however is that apart from AMZN, these are not tech companies. Thinking about their business model they are so dependent on ad revenue - their product from a revenue perspective disappears if you remove ads from the equation. Now, I am not saying ads would magically disappear, but who knows, as time goes by, corporations might understand that this crazy money paid out for some stupid ad may not be worth that much..

0,2020-07-03,"Here is how I think next week goes.

Monday we open +1-2%. TSLA up to 1250, AMZN up 3-4%. Plenty of ATHs being hit. Thread filled with 'stonk go up' memes. Small dip at the end of day. Plenty of people who think they are smart buy puts EOD.

The drop doesnt come Tuesday. Spy opens kind of flat but runs up 1-2%. During this run up, put holders get paper hands and sell. Afternoon hits and we drop back to where we opened. Plenty of people meming about buying the dip, and Spy ends maybe 0.5% up on the day. Tons of people who wake up at 2 PM fomo into calls. Put holders give up and switch to 0DTE Tsla calls or some shit that has already ran up 150% in a week.

It's Tuesday night and futures are pretty flat like the past week. Nothing unusual. 0DTE July 8th SPY call holders feel pretty good. Threads are bullish. Posts about Monday and Tuesday call tendies are filling the front page. It's getting pretty late, around midnight, and futures are -0.5%. No big deal. Futures lul. Pajama trader memes. Asia opens -1%. Futures down -1%. Lol morning shrek didlo will come. Europoor activates, futures -2%. A couple bears start coming out. A 0DTE call holder is dreaming of TSLA tendies... but does not know what is coming. They wake up at 9:28 AM, just before market open. Oh god, a blood bath.

We were at 315-319, market opens aroun 310. We fly down to 300. Call holders panic sell, smart bears cash out their only earnings in two weeks. 300 settles and some bulls decided, 'this must be the bottom.'. Call on calls on calls. 10 AM hits and we are back up to 305. 'Bears fuk' the wounded bulls cry. Then, right when 10:01 hits, we fly down to 297-300. Dumb bulls start bleeding their new calls. Panic sell, there goes their day trades for the week. The day is ending and the bear are out. 'SECOND LEG DOWN' '100,000 NEW CASES' 'SPY 220 EOM'. Giant FOMO into puts. This must be it.

A day or two later, maybe next week on Monday... SPY 310. The cycle begins again. 'Bears r fuk' 'Stocks only go up'",brave_potato,wallstreetbets,0.0

2,2020-07-03,"This is a losing game, and on top of that you ended up on the wrong side of luck, don't chalk it up to anything more than that.

The people that made a lot of money aren't geniuses. There's no way anyone would actually know the market would sour on TWTR instead of FB. There's no way to know AMZN would get crushed at earnings (based on their actual results and performance!) and also be the fastest growth of market cap in the whole market. Can you imagine people have fucking lost a lot of money on Amazon calls???

The market doesn't trade fundamentals, and you can't know what the vibe will be on any given day. Have you ever heard of a famous day trader? Nope, because nobody out there is consistently successful at this with big money. The only famous investors run funds a run strategies over years, which is the necessary time horizon to consistently succeed because you're ""right"" about your DD.

There’s the risk premium factor of low interest rates, but that shouldn’t change valuations so dramatically when rates were already low. So my tiny brain says they could both go to their pre-covid levels or lower given there is a recession.

Do you consider a 10% drop a crash? If so, intuitively it could happen. I’ve not heard any rational analysis of why these kinds of companies should be worth so much more now. AMZN I’ll give a pass because they’re killing it.",somanychins,wallstreetbets,8.0

The SPY 330C 7/17 is trading at 41 cents and has a theta of -0.51 which means it is going to lose 5 cents every fucking day over this 3 day weekend.  

There is literally no good news that could come out between now and Monday: Modera isn't going to launch a firework on Saturday announcing their vaccine is ready, and numbers for the virus are only skyrocketing... the jobs number was received pretty flatly.

438,2020-07-02,"Buckle up boys, it’s a long one. This is the story of the most expensive shit I’ve ever taken.


Since it’s a three day weekend coming up I was reminded (by myself) of the week leading up to Good Friday back in April where I bought 2 AMZN calls (I don’t remember the price but they were extremely extremely out of the money) that expired the following Friday for .94.


The Thursday before the market was closed they were up to $1300 a piece and being the genius that I am, I took to the wonderful streets of WSB for advice on what I should do with my AMZN calls, before I even had time to type in the question the sub was getting spammed with “don’t hold over a three day weekend, nobody with a brain holds over a three day weekend!” comments.


Since I have a brain I decided to sell one of my AMZN calls for a 1200 profit, and hold one just for the hell of it. So Monday rolls around (for the record I really don’t remember if it was Monday, but that’s my best guess and I’m about 85% sure it was) and AMZN starts off with the stiffest, girthiest, shrek cock these pretty blue eyes ever did see, and by the time the market hit 11:00 my AMZN call was up 17k and climbing, I couldn’t believe it. I sent my old man a screen shot. He couldn’t believe it. I thought back to this sub and everyone from Thursday that told me to sell and got pretty bent outta snap that I could’ve been up 35k, but their was no time to feel bad for myself, this stock could not be stopped. AMZN was on a tear,  and soon, my asshole was going to be on one as well. 


You see every morning I drink a black coffee, not because I’m some hardass that likes the taste of black coffee, but because the coffee maker at my house taste like absolute shit, so I put some ice in a mug, then some coffee, let the ice melt, and chug that disgusting cup of dirt water. But that Monday was different, I was so excited about seeing about that massive premarket neon green dildo that I didn’t even need a coffee to start my day, but come 11:00, the high was starting to wear off, so I went downstairs, poured myself a cup of mud, and tossed it down the ol hatch. About 30 seconds later I knew I was going to be painting my toilet in a matter of minutes.



By now my AMZN call is all the way up to 28K, and me being the genius that I am (remember I do have a brain, I sold one of these calls for 1300 on Thursday) forgets in the heat of the moment that you only need to be above 25K to day trade, so I hold and let this MFer ride. At this point I can’t hold back the mosh pit going on in my stomach and walk to the bathroom and throw my phone on the sink counter as I sprayed my toilet bowl like I was a graffiti artist. The only way I could describe it without being too vulgar would be picture a forest fire, and the forest fire is the toilet, now my asshole and shit would be the plane that flies over and dumps the red dust that absolutely coats the whole forest.


So obviously this was a messy dump, and I’m wiping and I’m wiping, and I’m wiping and I’m wiping some more, I’ve got a hairy ass crack, what more can I say. And eventually I stop and go to check on that beautiful Amazonian bitch on my wonderful Robinhood account and I see she’s at 23k and dropping fast, I go to sell, doesn’t execute. I go to sell at 22, doesn’t execute, and on and on and on it goes, until finally, she sells at 19k, and while I made an $18,900 profit, I lost out on 9 grand, all because I pushed off on my morning coffee.

And that’s the story of my most expensive shit.
(And how I missed out on and extra 27k because I followed this subs advice)

IPO’d in September last year at $16. At $34 now.

CSOD is diversified as an HCM vs docebo which is a pure LMS (total learning solution), but if you read Glassdoor reviews for CSOD, peep what their engineers are saying about the platform vs docebo. 

They’re the legit unicorn of the $20B  LMS industry  (SaaS corporate learning)

Likely will get acquired by AMZN, WDAY, or CRM before the 3 year lockout expires.

Fact: we were demoing the platform to 20~ AWS execs in Vegas. It was web casted back to leadership at HQ.

10,2020-07-04,"I gotta admit, AMZN’s last earnings miss surprised me. But I think AMZN was thrown off by the Pandemic and had to hire much more temporary workers than they ever would before during this time of year. Typically they ramp up hiring coming into the holiday seasons.  They know the surge in demand is coming and they take the opportunity to get new employee’s hired and trained in advance in anticipation. They started a hiring spree in March due to the increased Pandemic-related demand. They really should have started hiring in January and Feb, but they didn’t know at that time. Having such a big chunk of new hires who are untrained is extremely inefficient and costly to a company’s bottom line - until they are trained and efficient employees. I think AMZN knew they were going to be hit by an increased cost of revenue (Even though they beat on revenue expectations itself) and they chose to bite the bullet and miss on that earnings report, and remove guidance so they could blow the next ER out of the park.",riffdex,wallstreetbets,10.0

2,2020-07-06,"Fair enough. I think you underestimate WMT's logistics a bit, but even if I'm right, you're still not wrong. To properly take on AMZN, WMT+SHOP still needs a tech partner like GOOG or MSFT, and probably FDX or UPS as well. And all of them will have profit motives that would undermine the team, which gives AMZN a massive advantage.     
       
That said, the SHOP+WMT team up isn't just PR. They're essentially trying to do what everyone thought AMZN would do with Whole Foods -- turn it into a physical location for it's ""Best Selling"" items. WMT's facilities could also become warehouses for SHOP's products, and SHOP could sell that service to it's customers for extra revenue.      
     
Still, as I said, I'm with you. If AMZN wants to end the game, they could partner with TGT or COST and lease them their AMZN Go tech. WMT can't compete against that in a post COVID world. Also, once TGT, COST, or even HD, LOW, etc. agreed to license that tech, AMZN would have them by the short curlies.

If you think the stock is going to consistently gain, then the positive theta (you gain money as time goes on) and minimal required movement will be optimal for ATM/slightly OTM debits. I did a backtest and found it's 80-90% success rate for information technology stocks with an 80-100% return rate during a bull market/bull run. The risk/reward is amazing.

""Only beginners look at these charts""

No, they don't. They're usually very accurate, and only inaccurate because they don't consider all of the advanced greeks: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks_(finance). and, for the most part, volatility. You gain less because volatility goes down when the stock price goes up, devaluing your call slightly as the price rises. If anything, the chart is vouching for you by failing to calculate a decrease in volatility.

In terms of intrinsic value, these charts help. In terms of extrinsic value (volatility, second-level and third-level greeks, relation to bonds and the yield curve, market open and market close) there is no such calculation being performed. But I doubt most people care about that or even calculate it anyway.

In my experience this chart has been incredibly accurate anyway. It helps you calculate your exit point precisely.

If you're profiting off of the consistent gains of a reliable company like MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, DIS, FB, etc. then debit spreads are absolutely optimal. If you think FB is going to spike ~8% after an artifical drop, then FB calls are justified.",lnvisibleGhost,wallstreetbets,44.0

If you find a company that you think is going to have explosive growth and broad market has not caught on yet, yeah sure--get in now.

But, if you're thinking of buying QQQ, TSLA, MSFT, AMZN, or AAPL while they're at ATH. That's a FOMO trap. 

You're supposed to be selling into optimistic markets (when prices are high) and buying during fearful markets (when prices are low). 

FOMO leads to buy high because feelings are strongest when market optimism is brimming and stock prices are surging. 

Investors driven by FOMO should never time the market and just dollar cost average because waiting for FOMO to push you into a stock will always lead to buying high. 

FOMO, for example, was not poking its head out in March when everything was 50% off. 

Lastly, there will always be an opportunity somewhere in the market. I look for irrational movements across all stocks/ETFs that meet certain liquidity thresholds. Lately, I've been writing DDs on some of my favorites. 

Two I have invested in recently that I did not write DDs on are LHX (holding 7/17 180 calls at 1.50) and PLXS (bought shares at $62.76).",Big_Moe_,wallstreetbets,107.0

41,2020-07-07,"Call debit spread is when you buy a call, and then sell a call at a higher strike (for the same exp. date I believe). For example, I purchased a 1370c for 7/10 and also sold a 1380c for 7/10 at the same time. So, there’s a long leg and a short leg. The purpose of this is to “reduce risk” (sort-of), remove the effects of theta, and basically go long/bullish on a stock for cheaper (AMZN, TSLA, etc. get quite expensive with the premiums).


The max revenue from the spread is the difference between the strike prices. In my example, that means $1000 (1380-1370 x 100). But, I paid about $400 per spread so the maximum profit is going to be $600 (Difference in Strikes - Premium Paid). In order to get the full $600 per spread, TSLA has to close above the short leg (1380) on the expiration date (7/10). Put debit spreads are the same thing but with, well, puts. Let me know if anything is unclear! :)

You're basically selling a strike above your strike (against the call you hold) to lock in profit. How tight you choose the spread results in how much profit you can potentially lock in or how much more room it can run.

282,2020-07-06,"Exactly. TSLA is not the most innovative, it’s not leading the industry in technology, it may not even be the most affordable for what they do. 

But they are absolutely the Apple of their industry. People say there is a difference between a $1k phone and a vehicle, but I say if you are buying a new $1k phone every year, you can probably afford a $40k vehicle. Which is millions and millions of people. 

Plus they are going sort of an apple route and making my all their products related. If you have an iPhone you are probably going to buy the AirPods and watch. If you buy a Tesla, chances are you own a home so when it’s time for a new roof might as well get the solar roof that’s sold under the Tesla name. Helps cut down on charging costs for your vehicle anyway, so both products get more attractive buy buying them. 

I am predicting Tesla will be the first company hit by successful antitrust lawsuits after 1982 AT&amp;T.

544,2020-07-06,"I posted this in the July 3rd thread. Check my comments. Made my Tesla/Nio bucks today. Lets see if im right for rest of week. 

&gt;Here is how I think next week goes.

&gt;Monday we open +1-2%. TSLA up to 1250, AMZN up 3-4%. Plenty of ATHs being hit. Thread filled with 'stonk go up' memes. Small dip at the end of day. Plenty of people who think they are smart buy puts EOD.

&gt;The drop doesnt come Tuesday. Spy opens kind of flat but runs up 1-2%. During this run up, put holders get paper hands and sell. Afternoon hits and we drop back to where we opened. Plenty of people meming about buying the dip, and Spy ends maybe 0.5% up on the day. Tons of people who wake up at 2 PM fomo into calls. Put holders give up and switch to 0DTE Tsla calls or some shit that has already ran up 150% in a week.

&gt;It's Tuesday night and futures are pretty flat like the past week. Nothing unusual. 0DTE July 8th SPY call holders feel pretty good. Threads are bullish. Posts about Monday and Tuesday call tendies are filling the front page. It's getting pretty late, around midnight, and futures are -0.5%. No big deal. Futures lul. Pajama trader memes. Asia opens -1%. Futures down -1%. Lol morning shrek didlo will come. Europoor activates, futures -2%. A couple bears start coming out. A 0DTE call holder is dreaming of TSLA tendies... but does not know what is coming. They wake up at 9:28 AM, just before market open. Oh god, a blood bath.

&gt;We were at 315-319, market opens aroun 310. We fly down to 300. Call holders panic sell, smart bears cash out their only earnings in two weeks. 300 settles and some bulls decided, 'this must be the bottom.'. Call on calls on calls. 10 AM hits and we are back up to 305. 'Bears fuk' the wounded bulls cry. Then, right when 10:01 hits, we fly down to 297-300. Dumb bulls start bleeding their new calls. Panic sell, there goes their day trades for the week. The day is ending and the bear are out. 'SECOND LEG DOWN' '100,000 NEW CASES' 'SPY 220 EOM'. Giant FOMO into puts. This must be it.

&gt;A day or two later, maybe next week on Monday... SPY 310. The cycle begins again. 'Bears r fuk' 'Stocks only go up'",brave_potato,wallstreetbets,544.0

MSFT, AAPL,AMZN and FB need to drop with no other S&amp;P sector picking up the slack for the SPY to go down meaningfully.

37,2020-07-08,"# Market Predic_Ginn, July 8th

## Events Tomorrow

* MBA Mortgage Application Index (7am)
* EOA Crude Oil Inventories (10:30am)
* Consumer Credit (3pm)

## Notable Earnings Tomorrow

* Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY, after hours). A large retailer with a struggling presence even before covid. Look for the market to extrapolate the earnings to other retailers in similar positions. Any loss here will be shifted towards online giants (Amazon, Wayfair, Walmart, etc.).

## News Today (July 7th)

* Rumors of Walmart launching a service to compete with Amazon. $95 a year, free delivery, etc.
* U.S. begins formal withdrawal out of World Health Organization (WHO)
* Gold above $1,800, highest since 2011

# Bear Day Prediction

* Spy tilts towards 305. If deaths spike, and TX, FL, AZ, Las Vegas, or CA consider shutting down (to some extent), I believe we will see a similar sell off as today in travel sectors. I believe the inevitable realization that you have to slow down coronavirus is settling in. Coronavirus will not slow down on its own.
* I believe a reality and market check will happen by the end of the week. This means a bloody day (6/4, 6% drop).

Earnings will be a pivotal stretch for the market. Considering April and May were some of the highest saving months on record, money was not moving and when money isn't moving revenue is dropping across the economy. The aftermath could be a steady -3 to -5% per week as earnings continue. Final support is 250 (+/-25), no way we dip below March.

# Bull Day Prediction

* Spy pushes towards 318 behind tech and cloud firms (F, AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, AMZN, etc.). There may be a flight to quality heading to earnings season, which will bolster SPY, DAQ, etc. R2000 and others may suffer. I believe the global response to Covid will ensure a stronger rebound in the supply chain, which we so often hear about. I believe part of the bounce early this week was in part to supply chain (China rockets up 5%, we follow suit).
* I don't see spy escaping 320 this week. No one will be going out of their way to buy heavy before earnings. As mentioned above, earnings will be important. The market could realistically carry to 350 if earnings are not ""that bad."" If consumers shifted their demand to tech and away from entertainment, I believe we will just see a shift similar in the market (I believe we're already seeing it now. Fuck TSLA tho.)

# Kang Gang Prediction

* Everyone is too scared to do anything, volume remains low and prices remain flat. Go back to Australia you fucks. Spy 314 EoD and bouncing between 300-325 for 3 months with Jerome tugging us like fucking toddlers in a wagon away from scary bears.",Huckleberry_Ginn,wallstreetbets,37.0

Nope. Did you actually listen to the call or are you just making stuff up? The thermal imaging equipment has better gross margin than their average line (again, words straight from the CEO at call Q&amp;A). And of course it is offsetting the declines of other sectors in their business that's why is such a good development. In a Q2 saturated with horrible earnings, FLIR might actually be up y-o-y on revenue/profit.

And the announcement on Amzn was not pertaining FLIR, it just brought into limelight that thermal imaging is the way moving forward with running a business during COVID times and that cause demand to spike everywhere. And while AMZN might be ok with cheap chinese cameras, many others will not.",FootoftheBeast,wallstreetbets,325.0

328,2020-07-07,"Let me explain it to you guys 1 more time.

It SUCKS ASS dragging your little kids to Walmart to buy groceries.  Grocery pickup was already huge for WMT.  

Now you don't even have to load the kids up in the minivan. You just order and it shows up at your house.  

I get it, most of you are 20 and have no kids.  But many of us are in the suburbs with kids and going to WMT is a pain in the ass. However, WMT has great variety and prices. 

This is why this is a big deal.  People already pay $100 a year for AMZN so they can get cheap garbage delieved to their house that isn't even always very essential. 

AMZN can't compete on the grocery and everyday goods things like this with WMT in most markets.

Honestly, so many middle class families are going to love this because you can avoid going to Walmart altogether, yet still get the essentials needed at good prices.  There just aren't many options like Walmart out there.  AMZN can't compete with the grocery side at this point, and to be able to order groceries + stuff like shampoo etc and get it delivered to your door at a cheap price is huge.",Educational-Access,wallstreetbets,330.0

Do your best to be objective about the situation and understand what is the right thing to do right now. In that case, I held on to the positions I believed in and bought more of the positions I thought were unfairly battered, and I have since recovered.

I really try my best to evaluate my portfolio every day and ask myself if I would buy the positions I’m holding. If the answer is no, they should be sold, you have to ditch the sunk cost fallacy. It makes it easier to figure out when a losing position should be dropped.

The style of investing here is also very luck oriented, so don’t beat yourself up for being unlucky. AMZN completely shit itself after the last earnings. It’s gone up like 50% since then. People who went long options for AMZN through earnings lost a ton of money! That’s just unlucky. If you held FB last month you got rich. If you held TWTR you got poor. If you held TWTR this month you got rich. They’re in the same fucking industry.

I definitely wouldn’t go stupid long trying to chase losses right now. Personally, I’m in only shares and those are all with sold covered calls to de-risk as much as possible aside from a select few 2022 LEAPs.

87,2020-07-08,"The price you paid up front. A debit spread is basically just an option at a discount. The downside is it has a max gain. You pay less to get in, you make less of the stock moons.

If I buy AMZN 4000c for $10 and sell AMZN 4010c for $9 then I pay a total of $1. That's your max loss

If AMZN ends up above $4010 then both options get excersized and you make the difference between them (you buy 100 shares at 4000 and sell them at 4010, or rather your broker does automatically on your behalf) so you make $1000 minus the $1 you paid for the spread.

So it's way less costly that just buying an option strait up. But of course, if you'd bought that AMZN 4000c strait up, and the stock price made it all the way up there, you'd be sitting on a nice new yacht.",raltyinferno,wallstreetbets,87.0

## Events Tomorrow

* MBA Mortgage Application Index (7am)
* EOA Crude Oil Inventories (10:30am)
* Consumer Credit (3pm)

## Notable Earnings Tomorrow

* Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY, after hours). A large retailer with a struggling presence even before covid. Look for the market to extrapolate the earnings to other retailers in similar positions. Any loss here will be shifted towards online giants (Amazon, Wayfair, Walmart, etc.).

## News Today (July 7th)

* Rumors of Walmart launching a service to compete with Amazon. $95 a year, free delivery, etc.
* U.S. begins formal withdrawal out of World Health Organization (WHO)
* Gold above $1,800, highest since 2011

# Bear Day Prediction

* Spy tilts towards 305. If deaths spike, and TX, FL, AZ, Las Vegas, or CA consider shutting down (to some extent), I believe we will see a similar sell off as today in travel sectors. I believe the inevitable realization that you have to slow down coronavirus is settling in. Coronavirus will not slow down on its own.
* I believe a reality and market check will happen by the end of the week. This means a bloody day (6/4, 6% drop).

Earnings will be a pivotal stretch for the market. Considering April and May were some of the highest saving months on record, money was not moving and when money isn't moving revenue is dropping across the economy. The aftermath could be a steady -3 to -5% per week as earnings continue. Final support is 250 (+/-25), no way we dip below March.

# Bull Day Prediction

* Spy pushes towards 318 behind tech and cloud firms (F, AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, AMZN, etc.). There may be a flight to quality heading to earnings season, which will bolster SPY, DAQ, etc. R2000 and others may suffer. I believe the global response to Covid will ensure a stronger rebound in the supply chain, which we so often hear about. I believe part of the bounce early this week was in part to supply chain (China rockets up 5%, we follow suit).
* I don't see spy escaping 320 this week. No one will be going out of their way to buy heavy before earnings. As mentioned above, earnings will be important. The market could realistically carry to 350 if earnings are not ""that bad."" If consumers shifted their demand to tech and away from entertainment, I believe we will just see a shift similar in the market (I believe we're already seeing it now. Fuck TSLA tho.)

# Kang Gang Prediction

* Everyone is too scared to do anything, volume remains low and prices remain flat. Go back to Australia you fucks. Spy 314 EoD and bouncing between 300-325 for 3 months with Jerome tugging us like fucking toddlers in a wagon away from scary bears.",Huckleberry_Ginn,wallstreetbets,385.0

Buy AMZN $3200C 07/24 after amazon drops a bit over next day or so to ride up to earnings. Then day of earnings, sell right before and move in amazon puts for free money.  07/24 $2700P. Everyone is expecting a lot out of amazon. We reopened back in May, and everyone wanted to get out and about, why would everyone be staying inside ordering from amazon. Also unemployment high as fuck, everyone is throwing money into amazon stock vs actually getting shit from amazon. We will see how overvalued that shit is.

130,2020-07-10,"In my experience, I.V. spike always offsets losses from theta. Plus, many stocks tend to run up in price before earnings as well which helps off set it.

I am up between 55-130% on OTM calls I bought 2 days ago on the tech companies reporting in 2-3 weeks (AAPL, AMD, AMZN, GOOG, PYPL) I always buy minimum two contracts, once I hit 100% I sell half my contracts so the rest is all house money. Usually I sell the day earnings earnings are going to be announced/day before if they are being announced premarket the next morning sometimes keeping one contract to ride through

And, I am not sure you understand what selling options is if you think a rise in I.V. is a good thing? When you sell options, you want to sell when I.V. is high, then, I.V. drops, and the puts/calls you sold can be closed out for a profit.

When I sell an option, I want the price of the contract to go DOWN. If I sell a put and collect $1.00 in premium ($100) I want that contract to go down in value at least 50%. Then, I buy it back, locking in my 50% profit.

This is why you sell options the day of earnings/day before if announced premarket. I sold NKE puts the day before earnings, NKE dropped over 4% because their earnings report was awful. I was still able to buy those puts back 65% cheaper due to I.V. crush

Not a bubble. The key difference between 2000 and today is that beautiful motherfucker known as SaaS.

SaaS doesn’t work without AWS, Azure, etc etc.

This is the reason I believe long anything on Amazon and MSFT have such a high probability of winning, albeit the same reason I can’t afford long calls on either...yet.

I also gots me a theory that crisis and chaos of any kind may create more upside potential for SaaS products. 

We (humans) can recognize threats, analyze, adapt and then innovate at light speed compared to just 5 years ago. Forget about 2000.

And history has proven that we are never more opportunistic than we are after a crisis.

SaaS - ability to innovate and solve problems faster.

Crisis - creates problems to be solved

Lack of crisis - time to invest in preparedness for the next crisis...or opportunity.

Not all SaaS companies are good at solving the problem they set out to solve. 

But they still pay Amazon and Microsoft fuck tons of money, same as everyone else.

You'd probably need to sell one to cover the income tax of the value of the 2 stocks vested (your brokerage that handles the RSUs should give you the option and handle this step immediately) Of course, your tax wont be 1 entire stock value, just a part of it. So that stock gets sold, taxes paid, and any leftover you get in your next paycheck most likely.

Now with the remainder stock you have, you can choose to sell immediately, and you pocket the full amount (since you covered tax on the stock at that price).

Yes. NVDA today is valued as it will make 50-70bn revenue annually, in the future. With 20% earnings growth, that's 10 years away without an increase in market cap.

I like room for growth in my picks, and I don't think in 10 years or 50 years, that NVDA will be as synonymous as AMZN, APPL, GOOG, or MSFT are today. Therefore, as a longboi, I don't think at it's current valuation it's something I'd like to hold.",lmneozoo,wallstreetbets,677.0

Slowly working my way up.

Luckily my all time can never show red because I no longer have enough money to deposit to bring the starting amount positive lol, and the only way I can think of to make that amount fast enough is through trading, and well, that just would bring my all time higher, so, yeah, I can literally never lose the 26k I'm up, only 7k of it at this point, maybe 10k if this gap up is real",kinglax,wallstreetbets,847.0

Got it up to 15k but got cocky and lost a fuckton on my trading account so sold some stock in order to withdraw money as I wasn't getting income from trading that week and was in the process of getting a mortgage and having to put the downpayment on a rental property so needed some cash in my pocket. 

Right now I have 8k in there but it looks like my AMZN, NFLX, BABA and NVDA calls are going to gap me up a good amount so I'll be able to withdraw this week and put some back in my long term investing portfolio. 

Also, I'm new to all this stuff, only started trading May 4th with $750, and have always put money into stock portfolios like $10 or 20 at a time and would use it like a savings to get up to like 1 or 2k that I would need for a work trip or tuition or some other major expense i knew was coming. I've had my life changed by what to me is a fuckton of money and apparently to some people on this board is nothing at all so, hey, all the people who have it so good that 10k would no longer be life changing to you, why dont you each just give ME 10k and I'll make sure it changes someone's life",kinglax,wallstreetbets,848.0

44,2020-07-11,"I haven't picked specific positions yet, but basically calls on half the expected move up by just before earnings with strike dates just after earnings (with the intend to close before earnings). I just need to determine about how far I think they'll move up by their earnings.

Here's what I see are different tiers:

Tier 1:

PTON - Gyms are getting fucked left and right and PTON is building a community of avid paying subscribers, plus just recently talked about reduced price treadmills and such, so they clearly understand the key is to now expand their base. Could be a huge disruptor in the space. And investors don't seem to think LULU's acquisition of Mirror will matter to this as it bounced back after the initial dip after that.

TWLO - I wish I had realized they owned SendGrid before their last ER or I'd have possibly gotten on that. Between Twilio and SendGrid, they're pretty well positioned in the cloud space.

NET - IMO one of the more heard-of cloud companies in recent years. Not sure if they're that sound financially, but so many people use them that I feel like they'll keep going up. Also how do you not invest in a company with ticker NET for fuck's sake?

FB - Tiktok r fuk, and Insta is implementing TikTok-like features to capitalize on it, which I just found out today. It also seems like they shook off the boycott pretty easily, which doesn't surprise me as someone running ads on there for some clients. Shit's getting expensive on there but I don't really have a choice, so I imagine many others are in the same boat.

SQ - SHOP is getting all the glory, but if SQ's online stores gets any sort of traction, they'll be mini-SHOP + merchant account + CashApp and whatever else they dip their toes into. They're being run like a company that wants to be the next mega-tech company.

CHGG (which your post reminded me of) - The shift of school to at-home makes this a no-brainer, and interesting to see them expand to other areas.

Tier 2:

UPWK - Clearly they've been benefiting from the pandemic and should continue being a strong play. My only concern is that I find it more of a platform for outsourcing overseas than locally, so I'm not sure people have had success there.

FVRR - Ditto.

SNAP - Also benefiting from TikTok being dickslapped, but I think they're more in danger of being overvalued. FB is at least profitable and has a high upside anyways.

SPOT - Seems to be becoming the destination for podcasts in addition to radio.

ZM - Has run up so much already, but is a household name and like CHGG, is a school at home play, and is becoming a staple to use within many different industries. But it's so damn high already.

Tier 3:

PINS - Don't know what to make of Pinterest long term, but social's pretty strong right now other than TWTR.

DDOG - May belong in a higher tier, I just don't know enough about them other than it's had strong movement being on the cloud train.

RNG - TWLO-lite. Heard something about them being in online video which could put them as a ZM competitor, but skeptical of their recent movement showing they're not really a strong play now. May have higher upside though given that so who knows.

DKNG - One of the only tech-ish stocks that's also a recovery stock at this point, and feels like a good time to play them as there are lots of possibilities of good news propelling it up.

WMT - This may sound silly, but if their + will be looking to snipe subscribers for at least shipping but likely other things down the road from AMZN, this could be their ticket back into the upper echelons, and they've not gone up THAT much from it. This could be like going back in time and playing NFLX was when they just introduced streaming, and no, obviously they're not YET dabbling into that, but in general them getting subscribers for anything could have them pivot into whatever they want. It's only in tier 3 because it's still a retail stock at a time when most retail is getting hammered. Less upside than pure tech.",SunriseSurprise,wallstreetbets,44.0

RH fucking kills me though. I'd love to play TSLA and AMZN, either call debit or put credit spreads, but RH for whatever reason never seems to fill a spread order when I try to put it in. Just on that basis, I'll probably move to another broker before long.

149,2020-07-11,"I'll get downvoted but w/e

Let's take AMZN for example. Everyone knows the price is forward looking. Right now they have 21 billion in FCF. Let's be generous and say tech *should* trade at 30x FCF. AAPL, for instance, trades at 27x FCF. WMT (which is MUCH more tech than people give credit to), who has more infrastructure in place than AMZN for single/same day deliveries is trading at 24.5x FCF.

I digress. AMZN is trading at 76x FCF. They operate on liquid thin margins if you're not including AWS which its market share/profit margins are being competitively eaten up by GOOGL, MSFT, etc. Anyway, even INCLUDING AWS, to get twice the FCF is going to be insanely hard. When a company is that large, growth is so, so much harder to achieve. Also keep in mind that it would have to maintain its market cap.

My point being that AMZN, TSLA, NVDA, etc kind of companies are so forward looking that it will be impossible for them to ""catch up"" to their current evaluations. Eventually, either they'll lose market cap or grow FCF (probably a mixture of both). Please don't talk about growth potential either (what do you think forward looking means?)

I know the meme here is stocks only go up, which right now is true, but over time a company's goal is to make money and eventually hype will die down and investors will put money into more profitable/sustainable businesses. I'm not taking about value investing, either. It's never *not* happened given an extended period of time. And sure, we could have hyper asset inflation that is so far ""unknown"" making these PE ratios and FCF x's actually acceptable, but that wouldn't explain other companies being ""unfairly"" valued.

Anyway, my other point being is *some* of tech is in a bubble that *will* be popped. everyone knows this but no one knows when it will happen.",Toblet,wallstreetbets,149.0

110,2020-07-12,"Hey, my brothers. :)  
You may be sitting there looking at futures, desperate for hope that your last positions will save your portfolio.  If that is you, please listen.

Please take a step back and re-evaluate.  What keeps going wrong?  Why can't I seem to get this right?  It is time to take it easy and apply a few things.  Be patient, don't trade with emotion, set stop-losses and commit to them (same with profit percentages).  Remember that the market will be volatile for a while.  You're not going to miss out on something if you don't immediately make a trade.

It's okay to go a day without a trade.  It's okay to go several.  It's okay to sit out of TSLA, SPY, AMZN, etc. because you can't afford it. 

Be patient, buy as close to ITM or deep ITM as you can with a tight spread, good delta, and long-dated.  Stop playing weeklies, buy a few weeks out.  Papertrade with ThinkOrSwim for a few weeks to practice.

Everything will be alright, just take care of yourself.  You are important and if you need to step away from trading, do it.  It's okay.  Just don't dig the hole deeper.

It is a new week coming up.  Take your lessons learned and use them to do better.  I believe in you and know you'll be alright.",dwdsquared2,wallstreetbets,110.0

I look for things that are a staple product and integrated into society and the world to the extent that if they were to disappear, it would have a significant impact.

Secondly, do not downplay what WMT+ will be in comparison to AMZN, as they're a definitive competitor with a much, much larger economic presence, they have their own **logistics sector**, and their revenue is much **larger** than AMZNs (retail).  AMZN can only offer next day delivery in select areas, and an even smaller subset for which they offer groceries - WMT can pretty much do this anywhere SAME DAY, even in rural America where it's either them or Dollar General as your shopping choices.

More so, their demographic they target has a mild overlap into AMZNs, and it's strictly tax bracket based.  Add on the credit card line, and the long touted introduction into healthcare..

I'm bullish AF on AMZN.. but much more so on WMT.

1,2020-08-04,"Just my advice from someone with similar cash like you, buy shares not options.

Seriously I bought AMZN shares before earnings and was up ~600 dollars and sold them. Bought RCL before it got pumped and was up ~1k.

Now I bought ATVI friday and am up 600$. 

I am up 40% YTD and that's really good. If I buy shares of a company before earnings and they don't go as planned what will I lose? They drop like 5% and I lose 5% of my investment if I sell right away. But if I buy calls and they expire before I can turn a profit on them I might lose 100% of my investment. That's too risky for me.

I'd rather go for small 5% gains here and there and constantly growing my portofolio rather than blowing it all on options for the chance of a 10 bagger. 

And if you really want to try options set aside 10% of your cash for options. That's 1.5k. If you lose it all don't add more money into options. If you make money play with the money you made, you don't have to add more money if you're already making money.

It's going into tech because tech has been largely unaffected by the pandemic, and companies will not stop buying tech because that is where the future will be. 

By your logic, investing in TSLA 2 years ago when it was 150 a share was dumb because they didn't make a profit. I did, and made a nice profit.  

Investing in growth stocks specifically is more about understanding what the company does, understand the products they sell, DD on leadership and where they will fit in to the future of that market.

But, don't underestimate the capability of Tim Apple to make us buy a new iPhone.

Margin improvements would certainly help stonk. Plus, it may eat market share of Wintel.

Now, autonomous vehicle could also be considered a big factor to help them reach 5 trillion market cap.

Sure, it would greatly help MSFT, GOOG, AMZN or others to reach higher market cap, but then there’s Apple sheeps, who would gladly buy anything from the fruit company. And other companies may also get their fair share of growth due to this bonanza of autonomous cars, but this doesn’t stop from AAPL being valued higher.

TSLA is in a whole different league and is irrelevant regarding 5 trillion market cap discussion(for now).😅

About the Huawei issue, it would and it already have had negative effect on their sales. But that didn’t really stop them from growing there.

big tech like does not get fucking velocity.

SPCE gets velocity. DKNG gets velocity. FSLY gets velocity. shit like AAPL MSFT AMZN just doesn't.

last time one of them had velocity we used it to like battering ram 327. built up momentum with AMZN but it bounced off. tried with AAPL and MSFT but it bounced off too. but AMZN AAPL MSFT all together broke through. so maybe we're gonna go at 330 now.

but I've also seen us bounce off 323 and be 6% red.

dunno for sure if that's the plan or if we're just gonna fuck around all day because it's not like the big boys send out fucking group emails. so you just gotta read what they're doing and sorta go along with their plan.

241,2020-08-05,"&gt; everyone is trading NET!

Because due to COVID everything needs to be moved online.

NET (Cloudflare) already runs like half the internet. There's so much room for this company to grow. There's also FSLY as an alternative for NET but they had a way bigger run-up (400% YTD gains compared to 100% of NET).

It's my personal choice to trade NET right now between those 2, NET also has earnings coming up, but I will hold through earnings because they have a long way to go.

Idk if AMZN can hit 4k this year, it will go close tho. It was given a new price rating from 3600 to 3800 by most big investing companies. That's where I see amazon at the end of the year. But the thing with amazon is this: If I could only buy and hold one stock for the rest of my life it would probably be AMZN. It's easily one of the top 3 companies in the world right now and I don't see that changing in the next 10 years to come.



&gt; so for atvi i shouldve sold the day before earnings because the big run up was where the real gains are.

Pretty much yes. The stock gained like 6% in a day because people were pre-hyping the earnings. That's basically people saying ""your estimates are too low it will definitely beat them"". Then ATVI beats the estimates like everyone predicted. That's why beating estimates isn't a big deal when everyone expects them. The only way for this stock to go even higher after earnings it would need to crush estimates, like report 5x more than the estimates. Because then technically it would be the peoples expectations as well.",DrixGod,wallstreetbets,241.0
242,2020-08-05,"Everything in your post looks good,  except the leading chip. That isn't accurate at all.  I don't know if you care to research that but perf/watt is how servers are measured. Not to mention perf/dollar. In both cases amd is currently curb stomping Intel. Its the inertia of the server business that is going to be hard to overcome since most IT for business will just buy a few extra nodes when they need more compute rather than replace the whole thing and have to migrate etc.  

The opportunity here is azure and aws. With more compute being burdened by them,  essentially companies out source to them allowing msft and amzn to min max their data centers,  which will be picking amd unless under the table deals are made by Intel. This has happened in the past with OEM and reviews but that was 15 years ago.  Way to many independent reviewers now that have massive followings in the tech world.  

INTC won't have competition chips in server until late 2022 the earliest, most likely 2023.",KorOguy,wallstreetbets,242.0

see for atvi i bought the day before and it tanked on me =( i bought it at like 85, and i was gonna day trade it on earnings day thinking it will hit 89 or something. i have no idea how to play earnings, sigh.

so for atvi i shouldve sold the day before earnings because the big run up was where the real gains are. 

do you see amzn hitting 4k before yr end?

everyone is trading NET! why is that???",ikimashyoo,wallstreetbets,244.0
245,2020-08-05,"I bought AMZN at around 3000, and sold after earnings at roughly 3200.

And ATVI I bought  2 days before earnings I think it was around ~82 and I sold the day of earnings at 86.

I usually try to find big stocks that had a recent dump or play earnings. When playing earnings there are 2 things:

If a company is expected to beat earnings (like ATVI was) and it has a big run-up before earnings I will sell my shares the day before earnings. The run-up means there will be a sell-off usually after earnings unless they absolute crush it (like 1000%+ surprise).

Amazon was the opposite example. I was pretty sure it's gonna beat estimates but it had no run-up. It was basically flat for 1.5 weeks at 3000. So I held the stock through earnings.

It's not always a win. I lost around 700$ with TSLA earnings and was burned around 700 dollars with NIO too before. But then again, that's roughly ~5-7% of what I invested. With options that 700$ loss could have been a 14000$ loss.

Prior to that I had all of my investments in a low cost S&amp;P 500 Index at Vanguard which is one of my three benchmarks plus Dow and Nasdaq. I am up about 27.5% in 9 weeks. 

 I am constantly refining my strategy and actively researching companies and current news.  It is all about the time investment. I had a good foundation of understanding financials from my day job and Undergrad/MBA. If you are unwilling to invest the time then Index Funds are a good alternative. No one is getting rich on the passive Index funds. The other big issue is risk.  How much are you willing to take for the rate of return you will get? Goal is max return with minimal risk. Many people don't have the discipline to invest/trade without it getting out of control.  Rational decision making is critical.

I am invested in AAPL, MSFT, FB, CRSP, AMZN, ADBE, NVDA, AMD as more long term bets.  I also have invested in TSLA, CWH, SONO, ROKU, PTON, NFLX etc. You have reevaluate your positions and periodically sell investments.  I have sold too early and stayed in too long multiple times.

I really do. This community means so much to so many of us, myself included, but for the love of tendies, long SLV and GDX/J.

Look at oil. Notice anything? It’s creepin’.

Seen food prices recently? Creepin’.

If we have runaway inflation, oil and precious metals are not going to stop going up. Make sure you don’t get left in the inflation underworld completely tendie-less. Your paper dollar gains in AMZN or TSLA will mean nothing.

**If everyone buying gold right now is wrong what’s the worst that can happen?** 

Maybe you lose a little money here or there. That’s it. 

If precious metals collapse/backfire, it means we are back to steady bull market growth and a healthy economy that pays handsomely. Either way you’ll have more tendies in the future. 

**Don’t just look at this as a meme stock.** 

It’s not. Real people are going to be completely wiped out and standing in bread lines if this shit gets off the ground too much. Karma always comes back around. Don’t be the guy that has to buy silver at $50 or gold at $3000 to preserve the last of his dying dollars.

I only see people who have 200+ contracts on options really make money..

and yes it is gambling and I have to say the ""STOP OPTIONS and let your money work for you on APPL, BA, NVDA, AMZN..."" is the MOST CORRECT thing I've ever seen here on WSB.

That is the Absolute truth.

Options are a terrible thing and literally mean to decay. They are a time-limited bet, which is the dumbest thing you can do in the market!

So it's amazing we all keep hoping for that gamble to hit!

Of course sometimes they do, but 85% do not hit. 

I keep trying to mention that TD Ameritrade can give you 4x margin after you hit $25,000.. so that is $100,000 to buy on shares of SPXL or TQQQ or APPLE, or etc.. You let your money work for you over time, not let time work over you!

Options are time-limited so that is the most terrible idea ever in the market!

27,2020-08-07,I haven’t played 0DTE AMZN or TSLA in a while but I’d say prob close to $10k in total.  I would average down like a dummy hoping the move would reverse.  I try and stay away from any 0DTE moves right now since I’m trying to dig my account out of a shit hole.  Yes they can be extremely profitable but one chop or quick reverse will wipe everything out.,MP1182,wallstreetbets,27.0

I'm doing horribly right now but that fatass red candle for 8-8:10 would've caught my attention. After those kinds of run ups, the best thing you can do is have a stop loss. Just sucks because you don't know with candles until after the price has changed. There has to be some indicators that help confirm direction.

119,2020-08-07,"Hey man, this game is a roller coaster. I had 60k (unrealized) in TSLA FDs a month ago and was down to 10K two days later trying to day trade. Had I held my positions till Friday, woulda been worth like 90K. The run-up and subsequent fall was the wildest range of emotions I have ever felt in my life. Live by the FDs, die by the FDs. I don't mess with weeklies anymore. Obviously you get the best percentage gains if the underlying moves in your favor and the FOMO can be unreal, especially when you see ten-baggers getting posted on WSB. It's all about risk management.

I'm currently holding MSFT 9/18 210c that I picked up maybe a day or two after earnings. Got pretty lucky with the TikTok news, but couldn't close out cuz I decided to sell weeklies against them. Won't be doing that again ha. Not sure when I'll sell my positions but when I do I'll stay cash till a red day and buy back in. I avoid puts like the plague, and prefer to buy calls on red days opposed to buying puts on green days. As of right now I stick with tech, but it's getting scary. How much higher can it go? Obv entertainment, cruises, airlines, etc won't recover until we get a vaccine so tech seems like the safe haven for now. I also buy NTM options, only a strike price or two away from ATM.

It's tough making plays. You take a massive risk playing weeklies, massive risk holding through earnings, risk going too far OTM. I only started back in March, buying puts at the literal bottom and lost 8k. Got lucky on the late May/early June reopening euphoria and got SUPER fucking lucky (and subsequently unlucky) playing TSLA and AMZN weeklies in July. Got lucky with MSFT talks to buy TikTok a week before I picked up my calls. So i've got no real plays for ya.

The option plays people make here are short term so it doesn’t matter but long term there will be some regulatory scrutiny against these guys that will actually lead to changes, particularly for AMZN, FB, GOOGL, and AAPL (specifically for their practices with their App Store).

When AMZN does split, it will absolutely jump. There's no doubt about it. But Bezos is already the richest man in the world, he's not looking for easy ways to increase his wealth at the cost of face. Not with the Amazon machine as unstoppable as it is. 


----Edited to add:


Bezos has had a lot of attention on him recently due to his massive increase in wealth during the pandemic, the accusations of dodging taxes, and Amazon's controversy over employee &amp; contractor treatment.

 Bezos is likely not going to do anything that will call additional attention to him or Amazon. Especially with the possiblity of Biden winning the election. I believe this is one of the reasons why Amazon tried to spend as much as possible on their infrastructure and ""Covid prevention"" recently. He is trying to make Amazon not appear as profitable in the near term. In spite of this they still easily beat earnings estimates.

107,2020-08-11,"**If you purchased $10,000 worth of $SPY calls at the ""bottom"" how much are they worth today?**

Lets do some backtesting in Thinkorswim and find out!

On March 23, 2020 the ask price on **$SPY Sep 18 2020 $307c** was **1.00** ✅

Lets say we purchased 100 contracts for $10k.

With $SPY Sep 18 $307c is at 32.00 which gives us the total value of:

#$320,000

$10k to $300k from a boring index, all you need is luck and perfect timing. 🌈💰👌

111,2020-08-11,"Let's use simple numbers

Let's say you need $10,000 margin to trade a silver future contract. Your trading platform is looking at the movement in silver and sees that it is currently down 7.3% so they call up the risk department and the risk department says ""ok, we are heavily exposed because of SLV GANG and BTFDers, if silver drops 8.5% today, we could be out a lot of money. If it hits 8.5%, we will increase the margin needed from $10k to $15k per contract""

So you are a big baller that made $500k on TSLA/AMZN calls and decided to FOMO it into silver futures. You are riding 50 contracts and have more than enough margin.

Well, shit, you just got margin called and your broker is saying ""you need to deposit $250k TODAY to keep your 50 contracts or else we are liquidating"" and you think ""but.. fuck me! I only made $500k and YOLOed it into my SLV GANG FOMO! I DON'T HAVE ANOTHER $250k TO KEEP THESE CONTRACTS""

So your broker then says ""lol rekt"" and sells your contracts at market price since you can't meet your margin requirements.

1) vaccine will be approved by end of 2020-- massive acceleration in timeline (donnie pump aint call it operation warp speed for nothing  


2) big tech valuations are justified:

a) longest lived assets in an insanely low yield environment-- literally unkillable companies that will dominate for the next couple of decades

b) even if the small tech companies valuations drop, big tech has massive cash pile to put to work and is in perfect place to scoop them up for cheap and load up for next bull market. these companies are perfect boltons for msft, goog, or amzn cloud business

3) comparison to dotcom bubble is silly-- 

a) cash/profitability: a lot of these tech companies are FCF positive (alteryx for example) and underlying profitability in terms of LTV:CAC are pristine for a lot of these SaaS companies which means they should

24,2020-08-12,"All good points, I think there are a couple reasons to buy out Sears/JCP instead. For the space, given that commercial real estate is dying right now, they may have all the leverage in getting a great deal, especially if they buy all of the $1.3b in property JCP has. Counter to that though, mall space doesn't convert well/isn't cost efficient like you said. This could be easier for them to buy bulk space in all of the more populated locations. Their number one distribution problem is that WMT has like 5500 stores and is able to deliver faster than say the 500 Whole Foods or their regular distribution centers. More nefarious, my favorite, is that the mall is dying, and if you buy all of the JCP/Sears you significantly reduce foot traffic to the mall which hurts all of Amazon's retail competitors. If no one is going to the mall, and M shuts down then their brands are probably coming to AMZN. Having the space may help them drive out their competition without monopolization.",colton138138,wallstreetbets,24.0

For simply warehouse space, AMZN could acquire class C warehouse space for cheaper particularly in this market. Macys has older facilities too but they are in good shape. No water spots, stained carpets, rusty racks. Despite their poverty Macys has retained some glitz and glamor.

On-prem/hybrid cloud stuff earnings is coming up. VMW, NTNX, PSTG, DELL and HPE have earnings coming up within 2-4 weeks. I can tell you that I think NTNX and VMW are undervalued long term, that doesn’t really say anything about how their earnings will pan out. There is also SaaS companies, TEAM, DOCU, WORK, DDOG. I am bullish on CTXS.

The way I see it, much better idea to ignore all that and go into APPL, AMZN, FB, MSFT and GOOG. I think INTC is undervalued right now, but they need to change their perception in among the general public.

Deal talks for TikTok’s U.S. operations have hit a snag over the question of whether the app’s core algorithms can be included as part of a deal, according to people familiar with the matter.

The algorithms, which determine the videos served to users and are seen as TikTok’s secret sauce, were considered part of the deal negotiations up until Friday, when the Chinese government issued new restrictions on the export of artificial-intelligence technology, according to people familiar with the matter.

Now both sides are trying to figure out whether the order means the algorithms need Chinese government approval for transfer, and if so, whether Beijing would sign off. The complexity involved has reduced the chances that a deal could be completed soon.

TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance Ltd., has said it would comply with the Chinese government order, and is trying to get clarity from Beijing on how to proceed with a sale if the new restrictions apply to its algorithms, some of the people said.

For bidders, the idea of buying TikTok without the algorithms completely changes the outlook on what the companies are bidding for, other people familiar with the situation said. They believe a large portion of the value of TikTok is in the suggestion algorithms that keep users glued to the app.

A person close to the talks likened TikTok without its algorithms to a fancy car with a cheap engine. A different person close to the bidders said that not getting the algorithms would be a surprise, and was skeptical that the deal would proceed without them.

‘When you gaze into TikTok, TikTok gazes into you. To see it as merely a novelty meme video app for kids is to miss what is its much greater disruptive potential.’
— Eugene Wei, startup investor based in San Francisco

Other people have suggested that one of the suitors could still buy TikTok for its users, and develop new algorithms for the app.

The issue highlights how the participants in the high-profile deal talks are in the middle of a global tug of war between two superpowers that have each issued strict demands.

Two main groups are now vying to buy part of TikTok: Microsoft Corp. MSFT 0.77% has teamed up with Walmart Inc., WMT 6.29% and Oracle Corp. ORCL 0.77% has formed partnerships with some of ByteDance’s investors, including Sequoia Capital, General Atlantic and Coatue Management LLC.

ByteDance is asking $30 billion for TikTok’s U.S. operations, The Wall Street Journal has reported, though talks on valuation were fluid and continuing as of late last week.

The Trump administration has ordered the Chinese company to unload the platform’s American operations by mid-September or have it shut out of the U.S. market entirely. The administration has cited censorship and data-security concerns as reasons to force the sale.

Chinese commentators have described the Trump administration’s demand as an attempt by the U.S. government to appropriate Chinese technology in a forced fire sale. Beijing retaliated on Friday, when the Chinese government added content-recommendation technology to its list of export restrictions.

The addition was specifically to address a possible sale by TikTok of its core technology to a U.S. company, people familiar with the government’s thinking said.

TikTok has soared in popularity in the U.S. over the past couple of years, recently reaching 100 million monthly users in the U.S., from about 11 million in early 2018, the company has said. Industry analysts attribute part of the app’s growth to a powerful core algorithm that is built to quickly recommend different types of content to people depending on their preferences.

Eugene Wei, a San Francisco-based startup investor and former tech executive, said TikTok’s success is a direct result of ByteDance’s mastery of artificial intelligence. Using a process known as deep learning, ByteDance has trained its algorithms to deliver highly personalized content.

The platform serves users new videos one by one, measures how they interact with the videos, then feeds that data back into the algorithm. This allows the system to serve up videos each user is likely to find compelling.

“When you gaze into TikTok, TikTok gazes into you,” said Mr. Wei, who has worked at Facebook Inc.’s Oculus and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN 1.40% “To see it as merely a novelty meme video app for kids is to miss what is its much greater disruptive potential.”

Downloading TikTok and WeChat from the Google or Apple app stores in the U.S. could be blocked by President Trump's executive orders to restrict the Chinese-owned apps. WSJ watches the markets' reaction to understand what this means for global business.

One of the people familiar with Beijing’s thinking said the goal of the new restrictions is to delay the deal to allow the Chinese government to have a say as well as to subject it to a level of Chinese government scrutiny similar to that imposed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. The panel within the U.S. Treasury Department has forced the unwinding of several Chinese acquisitions on national-security grounds and has scrutinized TikTok.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian responded to a question about a potential TikTok sale at a regular media briefing on Monday by accusing the U.S. of using “economic-bullying and political-manipulation tactics against non-U.S. companies.”

Withholding the core algorithm wouldn’t necessarily spell the end of TikTok’s U.S. operations, as software engineers could still rebuild it using TikTok’s user data as a current training data set, according to Mr. Wei. But that process might take time and could lead the app to lose users to rivals, he said.

104,2020-09-01,"Hello all! 

Second day waiting for my Robinhood TSLA gains to appear so I can prepare to enter back in for another stock! Tomorrow will close out my first week as a day trader and I am excited to see if I can’t improve on my 7%+ total gains! It’s so cool to turn $500 into $535 while working construction in South Dakota! Thank you all for your kind support and kind words like “wtf is this riturd” and “get Fkd you r/AntStreetBets wannabe” hoping to cross into double digit % gains by End Of Week (EOW)! 

My hopes is Tesla (TSLA) crops below $441.01 per share so I can increase my slice of their big pie soon! Might put a few seeds in another company to diversify like Apple (AAPL) or take a risky move like Amazon (AMZN).

Hello, SPY? Please place an order for 10 tendies for us all this week!

12,2020-09-03,"Posted this earlier but expanded on it + positions:

Tech bubble was caused by dumb companies that made no money (Pets.com famously sold merchandise 27% below cost)

2008 was caused by the housing crisis (evictions are now illegal).

2001 crash was caused by 9/11.

What could pop this bubble? (If it's even a bubble). I’m holding my calls because it keeps going up no matter what. When we have a red day or negative news I tell myself: ""Stonks go up"" and either by EOD or the next day, it goes green without fail.

But at the same time I’m starting to get worried about a bubble- but what will trigger it? 
Money is practically free, poor people who are getting devastated by the virus with no stimulus never invested in the market anyways. If anything the average person with spare change can now throw their money into the market easier than ever before with RH.

I understand the subprime crisis was undetected, so what could possibly be undetected now? 
What will pop this? Am I missing something? Give me a reason not to hold my tech calls.
Sometimes I feel like the market will pop is because doubling my money in months doesn't sound right, this isn't supposed to happen. But maybe we're just smarter than the rest and making as much as we can while the printer is on (this doesn't sound right either).

-PS5/XBOX sales are going to shatter records

-black friday will be done entirely online

4,2020-09-04,"I love selling leaps after like 50% profit on an unusual run up,  then buying them again after a correction or pullback.  That being said i only do this with a company I believe has products and room to grow aggressively. AAPL, MSFT, AMD, AMZN etc.

Although you have so much time with leaps very small theta decay I like to trade them intermittently still especially with how the market has been non stop for the last 11 years.

Like when AMD ran from 55 to 75 I sold my leaps,  waited for a red day, rolled them into further otm leaps and dumped them at 90.5.

5,2020-09-04,"Join theta gang. Start with cash secured puts, if it's at 10 bucks don't just buy it, sell a put and get paid to hold it until your assigned. Then stop calls at same or higher strike price.

Its a slow grind but I've been quite pleased with the wheel. Just gotta be comfortable bagholding shares if price drops hard.

Only real catch, it's better to have a decent sized account to mitigate risk, ie being able to diversify in a number of different companies and to broaden what you can afford to sell puts on.

10,2020-09-05,"I don't buy calls that far out, the longest ill usually go is about three weeks. Long dated calls are not volatile enough for me and they lock up funds for longer periods of time. My two biggest ""tech"" plays would be AMZN and ZM but here's why I think they're safe. 

I bought AMZN down 10% from it's recent high, slightly below their post Q2 earnings annoucement price and lower than its closing price two months ago.  AMZN has not rallied anywhere near as much as TSLA and AAPL have recently, even though they absolutely CRUSHED earnings last quarter, so they have less of a way to go down. I can see AMZN moving up 15% in the next month, easy.

ZM just had earnings that some analysts are referring to as the ""greatest quarter in software history"". They went up 45% in one day, only to follow the market down  over the following 3 days to about -27% from it's peak. There is no question that their Q2 was far greater than anyone could have predicted. 355% rise in revenue and 284% increase in sales. I think once the market sell-off slows(which most of it may have already) ZM is going to melt back up 5-7% a day for about a week or two and be close to where it peaked after earnings. 

Reason for my other big plays:

LULU has gotten 10 analyst price upgrades in the last 3 days, and 15 in the last 3 weeks. But it followed the rest of the market down recently. I bought at 13% lower than its peak 2 days ago. They have been insanely busy lately and could absolute smash earnings so I am expecting it to run up 8-10% in Tuesday before the annoucement.

I guess I should just be happy with what I had, and avoid taking stupid risks on account of greed.

I was totally numb on the loss because it is just numbers in an app. Woke up a little later to see my account up 102% to 62K. Literally woke up at the right moment. Thank God for that.

&amp;#x200B;

Took a moment to come to my sense and sold around half at that time (at least I have learned to take profits). While I was selling it I saw the numbers fall from 65k-&gt;50k, literally in around 10-15 minutes. I use the robinhood website to it takes forever to do anything.

&amp;#x200B;

I was hoping for a further mid-day fall like it happened yesterday. I kept looking the the 5min charts to see a downtrend but it looked like tech was gaining and SPY was going flat. I said fuck it and liquidated the rest of my positions, don’t want to risk it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t know if I can take the anxiety anymore. Going to be all cash until tue/wed and see what happens, hopefully wont FOMO. 

&amp;#x200B;

I will also be changing my strategy. I have almost ALWAYS lost money reading WSB (where opinions, memes and anecdotes pass as DD), so I am going to do my own DD (AKA follow my gut) from now on. I will also (try to...) refrain from betting on earnings and buying bi-weeklies. I will probably never buy an option with more than a 50cent spread again.

75,2020-09-04,"You have some time but amazon earnings are not until later in Oct. 

Next time buy the dip and buy previously ITM calls fat out past earnings. That way the IV works for you and you can sell the news. 

If I were in your shoes and I fucking am I would hold until sept 29. That’s about a 10 days until expire to see how much you recouped. 

On the 29 I would cut my loses and sell either at open for the bull trap or at around 11 for the short squeeze. 

Now I think Amzn will go up. Remember institutional investors trading plan don’t have them holding positions over the long holiday weekend. So come post the holiday you’ll see the market begin to rebound as Inst. investors begin to VWAP back into position leading towards earnings. AMZN will have a steeler earning call but sell the news.

Recently put some more capital in the account and made some money on tech calls. Then lost 50% (30k) in one day on CHWY, DOCU, MDB, RKT etc. The market crash didn’t help. Sold everything and converted 100% of it into various puts (qqq, spy, tsla, amzn, aapl) as a YOLO.

170,2020-09-04,"I made money like everyone else being bearish in March. Then spent too much time playing puts and lost a good bit. Finally accepted that the powers that be were taking it up, and switched to calls. Went up big, then got greedy and played the big guys like AMZN/TSLA - that’s where I lost big, like really fucking big (10k in a day, 17 in a week I think) and I got PDT cuz I was dumb while over 25K. 

Now I stick to what I know (no more huge gambles), wait to see what seems like a clear bottom or clear top and by in the opposite direction to sell at next open. For instance, if SPY is down like 2% or more, there’s a good chance it’ll come back some that day, and open green the following morning, so I’d grab calls about 1% OTM. Or if MGM opens up 8% or something dumb, I’ll grab ATM puts and wait for it to level a bit, because 8% days are rare for a company that is still boned as long as COVID exists. 

The important thing is that you don’t have to make a play every day. If you’re not sure, holding on to what you have is more important than making a bet. AAPL and NVDA were sure things for me recently, and that’s what really helped my comeback. Also, having hedges like SQQQ or VXX can help on days like yesterday - I went from down 2K to up and still have all of my (now worthless) calls. 

Wait for a clear trend to emerge and hop on it. Right now no one knows if this is a correction or crash, wait for more info. Nothing is clear to me right now, so ima let my SQQQ and VXX play out and wait for the next good opportunity.",TH3PhilipJFry,wallstreetbets,170.0

35,2020-09-06,"This is how I partition my trading to get my degen fill while also attempting to actually have a portfolio that won't get me divorced:

**Long term account:** tax adv accounts where you have the typical boring mutual funds and ETFs. Light amount of options (less than 5% and only in leaps). I roll them out whenever they are under 1 year. Recently rolled June 2021 to Jan 2022.

**Mid term account:** more options here with expiry of 3-6 months, leaps, no weeklies unless I'm selling covered call or cash secured puts. Tech calls galore (had a nice build up from the CRWD run when it dipped under 100 just recently. Missed the run from 120 to freaking 150 but probably for the best).

Lately I've reduced a lot of my position here to cash given the return of VIX and will start a wheel strat of sort on AAPL. On Friday I added 4 lots and sold calls against them. Was gonna sell puts but even at the 8% drill the premiums for OTM 9/11 puts werent as attractive as OTM calls. Gonna do about 8 lots and go from there.

**Short term account.** Options galore here. This is where I day trade. Weeklies, 0dte shit, the stuff WSB is made of. I rarely keep a position overnight and attempt all those bs PrO tRadEr crap. Mostly I do amzn weeklies. Been having modest success until I took a 10k L this Fri, once again not cutting a position fast enough (it's always a bit hard when an underlying drills 8% within the first hour). Made about 30k-35k in Aug so this set things back a bit.

The account that does the best is unsurprisingly the mid term account as there is a lot of option selling activity there against shares and cash.

For the short term acct, I've come to accept that I HAVE to withdraw cash and keep my buying power artificially low (usually under 17k in a ~30k account) as anytime I have too much, I double down too far and keep chasing a losing position. This keeps me to only a few amzn contracts. On Fri after a good run for the week, I had a bit too much buying power and ended up having like 7 amzn 0dte shit at one point which got out of hand (again).

I started dividing things in earnest in the past year and added the withdraw rule in July after I had a -7k day on SHOP weeklies, wiping the weeks worth of scalping gains.

Honestly it's tough to tell WSB not to do crazy shit cuz I think about it almost day as well and you see the truly outlandish result here sometimes. Sure, it'll be amazing if I throw hundreds of thousands or millions into weeklies and 5 bagger it in a day, but that is how you also quickly lose your wealth as well.

I've been actively trading options for about 4 years now and while I can quickly evaluate a strike against it's underlying, the best bet and advice I can give is to stick to a few stocks you know extremely well. Throwing everything everywhere is a quick way to lose the ability to manage your trade. If you have to scroll pages down just to exit a losing position you suddenly remembered because someone screeched out it's ticker in the daily thread, you're probably doing it wrong.

12,2020-09-08,"Important point that this is ONLY shares. Total institutional holdings also includes warrants, calls, puts and so on so that may change things if that's included. I could actually do another analysis using total value and see if it makes a difference but most sites (finviz, yahoo finance, google finance, etc agree w/ this result and report data that only includes shares). Anyway, here's the data that goes into that calculation:

AMZN 6/30/20 total share holdings approx $790B:

    {'calendardate': datetime.date(2020, 6, 30), 'ticker': 'AMZN', 'name': 'AMAZON COM INC', 'shrholders': 3170, 'cllholders': 100, 'putholders': 82, 'wntholders': 0, 'dbtholders': 0, 'prfholders': 0, 'fndholders': 0, 'undholders': 0, 'shrunits': 287434248, 'cllunits': 18365446, 'putunits': 18076846, 'wntunits': 0, 'dbtunits': 0, 'prfunits': 0, 'fndunits': 0, 'undunits': 0, 'shrvalue': 790759450409, 'cllvalue': 52092231938, 'putvalue': 48961591908, 'wntvalue': 0, 'dbtvalue': 0, 'prfvalue': 0, 'fndvalue': 0, 'undvalue': 0, 'totalvalue': 891813274255, 'percentoftotal': 2.852}

Same data for 6/30/2015 (approx $136B):

    {'calendardate': datetime.date(2015, 6, 30), 'ticker': 'AMZN', 'name': 'AMAZON COM INC', 'shrholders': 1178, 'cllholders': 64, 'putholders': 59, 'wntholders': 0, 'dbtholders': 0, 'prfholders': 0, 'fndholders': 0, 'undholders': 0, 'shrunits': 314276627, 'cllunits': 12120249, 'putunits': 10925615, 'wntunits': 0, 'dbtunits': 0, 'prfunits': 0, 'fndunits': 0, 'undunits': 0, 'shrvalue': 136451045678, 'cllvalue': 4736516675, 'putvalue': 4566225508, 'wntvalue': 0, 'dbtvalue': 0, 'prfvalue': 0, 'fndvalue': 0, 'undvalue': 0, 'totalvalue': 145753787861, 'percentoftotal': 0.636}

Market cap of AMZN at those times respectively, based on closing price of the day they reported their quarterly earnings and disclosed outstanding shares which were pulled from the 10-Qs: 

6/30/2020: [$1.3760T](https://i.imgur.com/X0imqoh.png)

6/30/2015: [$202.1474B](https://imgur.com/3wwjChQ)

Calculation: 

**2020: 790B / 13760B = 57.41% ownership**

**2015: 136B / 202B = 67.32% ownership**

I mean I might be retarded, but that looks like a 10% drop to me. Feel free to dig up the reports and verify though. I'd share the individual ownership data (e.g. fund-level) but a) I don't have a license to share it and b) it'd be like a billion miles long and take you a year to do the math manually. There might be some sort of SEC disclosure that discloses total institutional holdings but as you can see by looking at total holdings value in the data, including calls/puts/warrants and so on does actually make a pretty big difference it seems, at least in the individual years. I don't know if it would influence the trend over the years, but it would be interesting to look at the data in this way too and see if you could determine whether whales are shifting to a more derivative-heavy ownership distribution.",ghostofgbt,wallstreetbets,12.0

16,2020-09-09,"OPINION: with average p/e's of 30+ future year earnings and contraction in U.S. GDP growth i think everyone knew the market was detached from fundamentals for quite some time

but stonks in the short term are an index of confidence (or the perception of other's confidence) in the real economy's ability to recover. Belief in the stimulus package, a vaccine,  the idea that even in a non-contact world tech companies can still kill or even exceed their current trajectory of growth - see AMZN, ZM, etc.- and a Trump election propelled the market to extreme bullishness.

But bullishness reaches a frenzy, a bacchanalic lizard-brain  party of debauched revelry with no fear of tomorrow that when it reaches its climax, corrects harshly and fast with a hangover.

The bulls on here are SEVERELY underestimating the significance of the SoftBank thing and what a big red flag it is. When someone is making trillions of  dollars of speculative leveraged bets on already all time highs in a market where the real economy is contracting, a huge psychological realization of ""has bullishness gone too far"" gets asked 

and once the question is asked, it's too late. people are no longer thinking with their emotional lizard brains, they're thinking rationally. And as previously stated, this bull market has not been rational. A feeling of trepidation and anxiety sets in, and the steadily accrued gains over a month get cut with jagged red knife red candles in 3 days. 

What does this mean going forward? The bullishness that still exists here and in the market  is just a denial of current momentum/sentiment and a desire to keep vested interests safe. There is no rationale or fundamentals underlying it in the same way there is for the bears, its just people trying to win a tug of war for the sake of tendies. As such, as happened today, there wasn't even a dead cat bounce, just a painful walk down some big bear flags.

If your entire portfolio was built on the bullish group psychology of ""stonks only go up"" you really need to ask yourself if you have any other thesis or event that will pump them and regain momentum, or if you're just clinging to this mentality when it has already withered and died.

Even if bulls manage to prevent a complete collapse, the best you can hope for for this ENTIRE MONTH is flatness.

I moved half of my 401k (what was left) after the crash into a Schwab SDBA connected to my 401k. Thankfully I found out about that option.

Since you are selling a call even if they are both in the money. Since you are selling a call They don't have to exercise it to complete your spread.

The one that you sold it to would have have his premium gone even if it is itm. If they choose not to risk it.

One guy here did a Debit spread. on Amazon both in the money. expired on friday. BUT in the money. They would have liqudated his call to pay the other's call. IF they activate it. But they didn't so they got stuck with the amzn shares itm.

But since they couldn't do anything with it over the weekend. When Tuesday Open Amzn WAS DOWN a ton. 

Even though he was in the money he lost money. Since RH force liquidated his position since he didn't have enough money. to keep Shares as he borrowed money to buy itm shares.

He was suppose to have profited 1900$* since the other person decided it be to risky holding it though the weekend he didn't activate his call when expired date was last friday for both calls. IF prices was the same on TUESDAY as it was on FRIDAY.

Even though it was itm he didn't take it those shares so the higher strike price lost money just his premium. 

The guy that was set for a maximum of 230, now basically in 1900$* profit.

But amzn DROPPED 150 points. But he still owned the shares cuz his call activated but it didn't sell to the other call holder cuz he didn't use his call even though he was in the money. The higher buyer thought it was to risky so he didn't activate it and get the shares apparently he was right he didn't want to hold it through a posssible drop even though he was itm. THE SHARES WERE STUCK with the original buyer.

So the seller now has 100 amzn shares. On BORROWED money even though no margin BUT had buying power cuz he was ITM. He was only up 1900$*. 

Now the guy might be in debt for 12k! since it was a force liquidation when it dropped 150 points.",lostcattears,wallstreetbets,3.0

26,2020-09-09,"I could be wrong on this but I believe the broker doesn’t get notified if the counterparty requests a ‘Do Not Exercise’ until the following business day. So Robinhood would not have been aware until Tuesday morning when they would have to sell to close the shares of AMZN at the open. I’m not 100% sure if this is correct but it’s the only thing that makes sense to me as to why they would have exercised it. These cases are super rare to see, since typically if the option is ITM both parties would exercise but in cases like this you can get screwed. Sorry this happened man. It’s a tough one when it’s a debit spread, you don’t expect to lose more than you put in.

32,2020-09-09,"Here's the options agreement you signed when you were approved to trade options. You acknowledged options are super risky. You agreed that Robinhood would exercise in-the-money long calls before expiration (4pm).

What you didn't realize, and have now learned, is that professional traders get until 5:30pm to decide whether they want to exercise their shares. While AMZN closed ITM at $3,289 (4pm), it was down to 3,274 by 5pm. The trader who bought your call probably decided that $3,280 was a bad price to pay for AMZN given the direction it was headed. 

So, you got to keep the premium from your short call since it expired worthless, but you had to pay back the margin Robinhood used to buy 100 shares of AMZN. By pre-market trading on Tuesday it was down to 3,150 when your position was liquidated. 

You owe the difference, and you agreed to the way Robinhood would act when your options were close to expiry. Next time do some research before signing contracts you don't understand.

Link to my loss porn 1 month ago: https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ht0pmi/rough_week_fuk_u_bezos_fuk_u_theta_gang_fuk_u_bers/

Then was down to 1.8k, was all in TSLA calls the night that they announced the split, rode it up to $1900/share but took profits a lot along the way (otherwise I'd be up six figures).. also made a lot on AMZN calls end of august.  Made 10k on the Monday that the TSLA share split happened, sold during power hour right around $495/share.  Today I had TSLA 10 x 400 calls expiring tomorrow that I bought yesterday with a cost basis around $2.50, sold those at 11 am for 4k profit, at noon I bought AMZN puts and sold those at 3:30 for another 4k profit.

Looking back it’s so ridiculous how such small amt of money can influence my emotions. But when u don’t have a lot, that really can feel like the world to you. 

So to fight these depressing emotions, I just kept myself super busy. I freaking worked like 60+ hours a week for a yr. Since I became antisocial and lost appetite, I saved decent money. Eventually suicidal thoughts went away. The thing is U never truly get over these losses imo. Only way to do that would be to make ur money back from the market.

106,2020-09-10,"My brother too is balls deep into The Intelligent Investor right now. Spot of context, I was up big, now lost my gambling money of 1.5k, he isn't even touching the market. The Intelligent Investor was written at a time far different from today when for example high-frequency trading didn't even exist as a concept and yet now makes up for more than 2/3's of the market trading volume and can manipulate shit us normies can't even comprehend.

Also, the world wasn't influenced by technology as much as it is today and that impact is just compounding on top of itself so being long tech, especially stuff like NVDA, AMD, AMZN, maybe some other decent players that aren't hyped up pieces of overpriced shit junk, is, I think, a vital part of every portfolio, and actually being 100% tech is probably the way to outperform the market. Think about what's coming in the not so distant future - self driving cars, stem cells, robotic cells that will be able to enter your body and reproduce according to a fucking algorithm that will reproduce only the antibodies to a virus for example, AI, VR, robots for absolutely everything... Just watch the documentary The Social Dilemma on Netflix for example, also a good example of the technology behind our daily lives that influences us as a species.

111,2020-09-10,"My 2c is that's a book that was first published in 1949, when companies only produced either tangible things or brainpower.  Those two products don't scale much beyond linear.  Fast forward to the era of tech, where software's fixed costs remain relatively stable while top-line growth can scale until the addressable market is met.  When I saw the cash pile that a company like Microsoft could build, and their P/E ratio crossed the mid-20s and people were warning about overvaluation, it became somewhat clear that some new definitions of value and growth potential were required for newer companies producing digital products.  Even a value investor like Buffet finally bought into AAPL.

I'm not saying the markets aren't overvalued.  I'm just saying that the old measures of value deserve some accommodation for companies who really can sustain high growth rates for decades.  And we cannot value companies like WeWork like a tech company just because they might house tech workers.

a good .5% move from amzn will net about 1-2k+ tho just from one contract once it breaks thru a resistance and you've scored the right direction.

fwiw you can easily overtrade and lose from theta and the bid/ask spread given amzn contract pricing. i'm sure you're aware of that. this is prob what i need to work on the most. sometimes i hit my goal within the first hour and i greedily keep at it and have to work my way back thru the day.

Someday when volatility drops back down and stocks stop moving like they have been earnings may become worth it again.

Some random ideas Ive had knocking around:

People keep talking about sector rotation but we likely won't see a true one until after coronavirus is really handled either by faking the numbers or having a vaccine so be weary of these mini pumps that only end up dumping within a weeks.

Financials will likely be depressed until we get higher interest rates so they will probably be depressed forever.

PTON and CHWY are dumb as shit but once the sell off has stabilized it might be good to keep an eye out for upward movement on these as investors don't know where to put their money and the big tech names are already super inflated.

JD seems really undervalued and it seems worth it to play them into earnings and maybe hold a few contracts through earnings.

Half the time financial media reports on the reasons for a market movement they're wrong. Half the financial media reports on the reasons for a market movement they're lying. A tenth of the time they're half right while also simultaneously being half wrong or lying.

That being said the soft bank thing is real in the sense that call to put ratio has been wildly inflated the past few months and calls on individual stocks have been at an all time high meaning other actors such as hedge funds have likely been doing the same strat as soft bank leading to a huge gamma squeeze but it probably wasnt just soft bank alone.

In the current market environment the macro trend will usually trump the trend of a specific stock, you can be right about a stock in particular but market sentiment is heavily affected by current sentiment on AAPL, TSLA, MSFT, AMZN, FB, and GOOG. Im not sure this is what happened to CHWY and PTON but it might have something to do with it. If there's a shift in the sentiment on the big guys its probably worth it to reposition on other stocks as well. That being said I think we're gonna have a little bit of optimism at the beginning of the next week on the big tech guys but I heard big banks have to do book keeping Q1 and Q3 so we might see some selling through the end of the week next week. My current prediction is green AF Monday followed by selling through Friday.

After that I think big tech will start to settle into a range and go flatish for a while and we'll see upward momentum in CHWY, PTON type stocks as well as chinese tech like JD. Maybe even GLD and SLV as investors will be looking for where to park their $$. Some people think we're gonna see Feb March type crash again. No. That will never happen again, it was a once in a life time thing and when it happens again it will be during a time when no one sees it coming and everyone has forgotten such a crash was even possible. I am doing my part by forgetting that its possible right now but it will likely be years before everybody has forgotten that its possible and then maybe we'll see another crash like that again but not any time soon.

Lastly all of this is probably bullshit and will end up being wrong the number one thing about these big picture thesis stuff is that you're always looking for why you might be wrong and/or why you might be right but you're early because market sentiment isn't going to catch up fast enough to be worth the theta you're burning. The other post I made I think has good mantras that are generally relevant but this post is mostly random predictions Im making about the future and people are almost always wrong when they try to predict the future, including me.

Also ZM is stupid as fuck but I'm not shorting it, it has retard strength and schools are using it now. But it sucks and it has hella competitors in its niche.

Sorry for rambling if theres anything important Ive said it's to be patient. The biggest advantage you have over an institutional trader is that institutional traders have to be in a position all the time, they are constantly trading like it's their job. Don't try to beat them at their job. Just be the guy that sits and waits for the really obvious trades to come along, gets in on those trades, and captures some gains on the way up so they dont get caught with the bag.",GenuineArdvark,wallstreetbets,10.0

## Daily Synopsis 

* The S&amp;P 500 increased 0.1% on this 19th anniversary of 9/11 but continued selling in the mega-caps limited the upside. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite (-0.6%) and Russell 2000 (-0.7%) closed lower. 
* Similar to the days before, today's price action was technically-oriented given the absence of market-moving news and the losses in stocks like Apple (AAPL 112.00, -1.49, -1.3%), Amazon (AMZN 3116.22, -58.89, -1.9%), and Microsoft (MSFT 204.03, -1.34, -0.7%) on no specific corporate news. Apple shares fell 7.4% this week. 
* The difference today was that their losses were offset by relative strength in the cyclical sectors, namely industrials (+1.4%), materials (+1.3%), and financials (+0.8%). Still, when Apple and Amazon are down more than 1.0%, there must be more winners than losers to make a meaningful difference. 
* There were more of the latter on Friday, as declining issues outpaced advancing issues at the NYSE and Nasdaq. The information technology (-0.8%), consumer discretionary (-0.3%), and communication services (-0.3%) sectors ended the day in negative territory due to their exposure to the mega-cap stocks. 
* Interestingly, the S&amp;P 500 was down as much as 0.9% intraday and fell below its 50-day moving average (3322). A broad rebound in the afternoon, however, helped the benchmark index turn positive and close above the key technical level. 
* Shares of Oracle (ORCL 57.00, -0.33, -0.6%), Peloton (PTON 84.04, -3.71, -4.2%), and Kroger (KR 34.37, -0.37, -1.1%) finished lower following their earnings reports. Note, ORCL shares were up as much as 7.9%, and PTON shares were up as much as 11.8%. 
* U.S. Treasuries finished on a higher note. The 2-yr yield declined one basis point to 0.13%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.67%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.1% to 93.28. WTI crude futures increased 0.2%, or $0.07, to $37.34/bbl.
* There are no notable economic reports scheduled for Monday.

75,2020-09-11,"I like it. I'm gonna keep buying the dip. They have a good head on their shoulders, every analyst has a PT well above current prices, and it's an industry as a whole that is dominated by slow retail incumbents that have no idea how to execute in e-commerce. Reminds me of JD two years ago when they weren't given time to unroll fruits of their opex labor until covid (and punished for not showing operational efficiency, much like $CHWY gang is now). 

This ain't your TSLA, AAPL stonk but the seeds are planted to unfold over time. The market can swing any way it wants due to volatility but that doesn't change their tailwinds, incoming 2nd wave covid (some might argue the 1st is never going away until vax -- even then it's a big opportunity to teach the customer), upcoming preparation for holiday season, and execution.

After listening and watching every single interview with Sumit Singh (ex director of $AMZN fresh) I'm convinced he's a great leader for the business in this time (turnover of goods w/ shelf-life, retention in price-competitive markets). I joined Chewy's Facebook fan group to get a pulse on the customer and it's just chock full of pet photos, stories of great customer service, and customer WoM (cheapest form of advertising -- 0 spend). It's rare you have an ecomm company that gets John Smith and Mary Jane and their grandma this excited, and loyalty goes a long way. Everything points to long term success, even if numbers ain't shown. Me likey.",stonks_justgoup,wallstreetbets,75.0

25,2020-09-12,Why not just buy puts on some fake AMZN garbage like Wayfair or Overstock?,Vcize,wallstreetbets,25.0
26,2020-09-12,"No there’s 2 separate things going on here sorry. 

1) covered calls are typically covered by stock. So I own shares, I sell a call. If the shares go up to the strike price I sold at, I lose the shares, but keep the premium, and whatever the shares eventually sold at. So I sell a 7.50 and my cost basis is 6, I make 1.50 a share plus premium.

If it goes to 20 bucks or something, I miss out on a lot of potential profit but I already came to terms with that haha.

2) covered put. The buyer of the put that Tren sold has the option to exercise the put and this would mean tren has to buy the shares at 5. A lot of people don’t do this, because they don’t want the shares, they’ll just sell it to someone else. 

This is much more common with big stocks like amzn. Most of us don’t have the money to exercise an amzn option, even if our put makes it “cheap”, because it’s still thousands of dollars.

If tren is the seller of a put, he used cash to secure it, so he’s got the money to buy the shares if he has to. 

Does that make sense? 

Basically cash covered = puts, and shares = covered calls for theta gang.",Houston_swimmer,wallstreetbets,26.0

28,2020-09-12,"Well, I don’t really know what I’m doing so this is more of an experiment, but I saw AMZN fell out of its channel last week and then on Friday closed below the 50 MA where it had briefly held support. I bought a pretty far OTM call and put with 2 week expirations, so they only cost like $600-$800 each.

I then turned whatever I had left into roughly $66k profit in two days, 1000% ROI on my $1.6k, and then another 1000% ROI on my $5k.

Took a break from the end of March to April, dabbled in light plays here and there, learned about theta gang, decided to jump back in the market with $NET, made a decent $5k, then I played $RKT, rode it from $22 to roughly $32, made a solid $60-70k from $RKT. Now I just have all my money in a long term portfolio that consists of $200k in $AMZN, $12k $AAPL, and $35k $UPS, I plan on liquidating $AAPL/$UPS, by their ER dates so I can use the profit+principle for real estate; going to leave $AMZN for a year or so and see what happens, if it appreciates a good amount by next year, I’ll pull out more and get more houses.

44,2020-10-02,"How about reading Peter Lynch's One Up On Wall Street? One key takeaway: never buy an IPO. There is never a need to buy an IPO. Many tremendous stocks (GOOG, AMZN, TSLA, NFLX, WMT, APPL) could have been bought 5-10 years after the IPO and still made almost all the gains. Your first filter should be ""The company has survived their own sector for 5-10 years"".

Palantir?! You  ought to ask yourself some hard questions about why that appealed you. It sure wasn't their financials. In addition to never coming close to making money, their growth is shit. Oh, and they have a small customer base, the details of which they didn't disclose. So what was it? Was it the ""mystery"" around them? The vaguely sinister vibe? What caused you to think it was worth risking money on? I can't guess what Palantir may be worth in the future, but it seem like the only observable evidence of their promise is some famous names associated with it.

**Why is this a good bet?**

Well, it's underwritten by the big boys like **Goldman Sach, BoA**, etc. They will pump it up to at least above the IPO price @ $10... Anything below $10 means the big boys will loose money. See? **BQ is therefore a steal @ $6+ now.**

Did you know one of the biggest reasons why PLTR didn't moon as predicted? Becos they tried to save money by cutting out the big boys. That's why. PLTR is a good stonk. Keep some for the rainy days.

They're expanding into new areas like IOT and healthcare and sendgrid is a great acquisition. They have one of the highest net revenue retention rates so customers are spending more because there's huge value in directly communicating with customers (link below).

Shopify and Twilio have similar revenue numbers and growth and Shopify is now a $100 billion company and trades at 60 times sales. Twilio trades at a very reasonable 20ish times sales for high growth tech. Different kind of tech but still interesting (links below)

Also the chart. The stock went up 700% between 2018-2019 and hasn't gone up that much since then. 2020 has been a year of multiple expansion for tech and Twilio hasn't seen much of it. I think this is partially due to higher share price which keeps retail out (90% institutional investors) and the stock is up 300% off the lows).

I only recently bought in but I'm a long term investor and will not sell even if there's a crash (hedge with puts or VXX calls). I believe Twilio will be considered a big tech company like MSFT AMZN AAPL and have a market cap in the hundreds of billions by the end of the decade

One of my longest posts ever was me trying to convince a JWN investor to get short term puts as a hedge against her calls. I even replied to some dude weighing long term AAPL vs. JWN telling him AAPL.  Literally, all their peers but KSS and DDS have tanked hard. Nordstrom will be killed by Millennials and Gen Z in addition to clientele that moves on to other stuff.  The female shopper has and always will be fickle. It's  going to tank. It would need to pull an AMZN or GME to recover , but it won't since it's just a clothing store. They have too much competition. Physical stores are considered debt liabilities now. They have to sell off 30% more of their stores before they can recover. It might recover in 2021 in September or December, but honestly find something else to get hyped about: DDOG, MSFT, WWR , APHA or anything that is clearly showing up trend and euphoria.

Decided against my better judgement to hold the 10/9 call through the weekend bc FML. Now instead of making 90% profit, I sold that call for a 50% loss (-$6.5k swing in my portfolio) when AMZN hit $3150 today, thinking theta would never let it recover even if it went back to $3200 by 10/9. Decided to diamond hand the 10/23 call bc the longer DTE and earnings on 10/22. Now there's no stimmy coming and the stock is sub 3100 and drilling. Original plan last week was to ride the earnings wave and dump before the announcement (though part of me was tempted to hold through earnings on the chance AMZN made like ZM and mooned, especially given the upgraded price targets on Wall Street).

0,2020-10-09,"Pattern Day Trader. If you have less than 25k in your account you can only do 3 trades per 5 rolling days or 90 day ban. My suggestions are TSLA and AMZN. Watch at least a couple youtube videos on the greeks to understand how your options will react. You pick whatever you want as long as the volume is there. the tighter the bid/ask the better liquidity there is. Just look for something that you can afford with a delta of .5 or greater. Most ATM options will have at least a delta of .5 or greater. This means for every 1 dollar the stock move your option contract moves 50 cents. Go with the most delta that you can afford. The deeper ITM you get the higher the delta. I would say to paper trade for awhile to learn how ToS works and to get a feel for the platform works/options work, but honestly the best teacher is seeing your portfolio nose dive 50% and having to claw your way back up.",zamudio09,wallstreetbets,0.0

YOLO on something that moves like TSLA or AMZN. Never diversify. Whenever a lower band breaks pull out even if you lose some money until an uptrend is reformed. Never hold the contracts overnight. Rinse and repeat until you’re clear of PDT then just keep doing this. If it goes extremely bad and you drop more than 5% right away market sell and again wait for uptrend. Recovering from 5% losses is easier than holding out for a gain that might not come. Sell once you hit top band. If it looks like it’s breaking resistance, hold until it starts to dip.

I just wait til about 1030/11am to see the daily trend and then buy calls or puts based on the trend. Usually only do about $1500-2000 at a time. Once I get past 50% profit on the day the I start looking for an exit. I do a tight SL using like 3-5%. So sometimes my day trade is up immediately.

Follow what’s going on with the big boys like TSLA, AMZN, etc. and then try to find some undervalue gems in the same sector. When the big boys go on huge runs, the money usually trickles down to the smaller companies. That’s how I was able to find NIO, JMIA, and JKS. Also, study candlestick patterns. You don’t need to know them all, but learning one could increase your success rate substantially.

20,2020-10-10,"i mean every single red candle today after POTUS stimulus news pump was cuz of various tweets/journo reporting McConnell comments. 

made for a great entry on amzn 0dte tho. 

the stimulus hope + upgrade eventually won out on GOP Senate's stimulus nope.

thought this tweet summed up the GOP stimulus chaos pretty well via @kaylatausche

GOP stimulus positions:

* June -- None needed
* July 27 -- $1 trillion
* Aug. 28 -- $1.3 trillion
* Sept. 10 -- $500 billion
* Sept. 30 -- $1.6 trillion
* Oct. 6 AM -- None needed
* Oct. 6 PM -- PPP + Airlines + Stimulus checks
* Oct. 9 -- ""Go Big!""

i recommend others trading on stimulus news to follow various twitter account as they'll get you a chance to get into the weeklies, 0dte movements in a more timely matter:

Digital sales is growing quickly, physical media sales will be for niche collectors and global markets only in a few years. GME has no access to digital platform sales and on the other side is competing against mega retailers like AMZN that eat losses on game sales to drive customers to their site for broader purchasing. Not to mention more and more of the biggest properties being f2p with recurrent monetization mechanics — again, where GME has no access to participate. The industry has transitioned, the platform providers have cut-out the middle-men and physical media and the consumers prefer it that way. Finally, there is no margin on new console sales, the margin is in the games. So GME can sell all the PS5s they want, but majority of those people are going home to buy their games digitally, which is where all the profit is.",dpetropo,wallstreetbets,2.0

56,2020-10-11,"Yes! I do weekly credit spreads as earnings plays. I go far OTM so I give myself some wiggle room.

E.g. Amazon has earnings on Thu. I wait till a dip or red day to open some put credit spreads. If amazon is at 3200 I would maybe do a bunch of 2900/2890 put credit spreads. You make full profit as long as amzn doesn’t drop to 2900 which it almost certainly won’t. The beautiful thing is you don’t have to be right - if amzn misses earnings and drops to 3000 you still win your max profit. And IV crush and theta decay are on your side.

Also for regular calls and puts I started making a lot more money when I buy things 4+ months till expiration and reserve money to average down if things don’t go my way at the beginning.

I'd be less comfortable in the Spring, but we have a lot of things going for us this season (earnings, shopping season, the carrot probably stimulus at some point).

205,2020-10-12,"Mega cap tech is the way to go right now. When it dips, just DCA into it. And it's inflated, but they're also the ones benefitting most from the pandemic (AMZN, MSFT's cloud services are only going to expand). The P/E will catch up with the valuation eventually, its not like the dot-com bubble where unprofitable tech companies were hyper-inflating. And if Congress forces a split, the sum-of-the-parts valuation will mean they'll be priced even higher. 

I'm also deep in renewables (NEE and SPWR). If there's a Biden victory, these will moon, but even with a Trump win, NEE is making huge moves to take out competitors. As solar and wind get cheaper and cheaper, fossil fuels will lose market share fast. Anyone long-term in oil stocks is betting against progress, and that's pretty much always a losing bet. NEE's upcoming 4-1 split will only further cement them as an investor favorite.",Mikey2121,wallstreetbets,205.0

Let me whip out the decoder ring for you - it's really fucking simple.

The VIX has plummeted because you've literally watched election volatility dry up before your eyes with the orange actions on twitter and the Rona diagnosis.  A loss by the incumbent candidate almost assures that big time helicopter money is coming for the American consumer.   Like 2.6T worth.

And there is NOTHING more that the American consumer likes to buy more than shit off of Amazon, and iPhones.  Period.  And THAT is going to trickle down to most other businesses that don't sell buggywhips.

I've been casually looking for the answer for 7 years.

Too many under too many names.

TLDR I believe the only reason GOOG isn't valued at AAPL  or AMZN levels is because they're better at hiding. They dgaf about punitive fines because they know it's a a fraction of what they gain by breaking the law,  even compared to other businesses.

If your ETF goes for 10% a year (which is already generous)  and you don't touch that money for 10 years your account will be worth 13k.

So you made 8k dollars in 10 years.

If you have small sums it's better to try and invest into some speculative stocks for example. At worst you lose what? 5k? At best you might hit something like TSLA/NIO or something that grows like AMZN/NFLX and your 5k could be worth 50k in 10 years.

92,2020-11-09,"Yea I did that with TSLA before the split because you could sell 5-10 spreads for like 5k-8k per week but everyone says it basically works until it doesn't since one loss can wipe out a bunch of wins. Lots of the guys at thetagang talk about risk management but they also get excited making like 500 per week but in all fairness, they never blow up their account. I still think writing options is the way to go but you just have to be really careful which stocks you choose and timing is important. If I ever make a lot of money I'll probably just sell CC's on AMZN or something since you can make about 3-5k per week from that.",Sharky-Li,wallstreetbets,92.0

I like INTC because they're decent value, even though they need to get their shit together. CSCO I like a lot for value. 

I like AMD and NVDA, or even TSM, but I think they are overvalued. So I have my doubts on how much those will continue to rally if the market continues trending up.

135,2020-11-09,"I think they will, absolutely.  Studios have consistently reaffirmed their long term reliance on exhibition (theaters) for large films.  As an added bonus, in their recent ER call, CNK said that they're working (continuing talks) with major streaming players to debut some of their major content in theaters with a short exhibition window.  That makes it MUCH easier for NFLX, AMZN, Hulu, Apple, etc, to make larger-budget propriety content, because they can capitalize on the cinema market with non-subscribers (AND subscribers who want the immersive experience) and potentially garner new subscribers from the theatergoers.",its_Tow,wallstreetbets,135.0

53,2020-11-11,"Unless it's an isolated event (like say an isolated AAPL earnings or some good Amazon news), the index usually is the first component that factors into each individual stocks price. It's true it's a cause and effect and you can ask which comes first. But the reason the index matters more is notional amount traded on SPX/NDX and SPY/QQQ is huge and most passive funds are only trading the index or ETF. Thus on a day like today, where QQQ is down, most of the big tech names making it up are down (MSFT, FB, AMZN, TSLA, Apple actually did well but followed a similar intraday pattern to QQQ and somewhat SPY). 

It's not that algos/funds decided to sell each individual tech stock which then drives down QQQ but rather MM/algos/institutions/hedge funds/small amount of retail sold SPY/QQQ (or bought a lot of puts on these - causing options MM to delta hedge by selling shares) and then by doing that, ETF MM have to then also sell these tech names individually as a result to keep the portfolio balanced since there's a direct mathematical formula. Like if you were a fund and you wanted to sell tech, it's clearly much cheaper to just sell the index than go through name by name. 

But this breaks for individual names on a lot of days too with individual events. I'm not even saying Tesla is that correlated but it definitely has some correlation. A name like Microsoft would have an even stronger correlation.",infinitelimits00,wallstreetbets,53.0

57,2020-11-11,"Bro if TSLA retests the 360-380 range, especially the lower 360s (due to market sell off, not actual news) I would definitely without a doubt suggest leaps on that shit. It'll print for free money. I see TSLA being an easy $500 in 2021. So if you are happy with that kind of return and you can get in at that price, go for it.

I think the problem is the big safe stocks like TSLA AMZN NVDA and SPY too they aren't as MEME as your other stocks like NIO GME etc. The returns aren't as wild. But a good way to blow up your account is to go after those Meme stocks  lol. Greed is a crazy thing isnt it.",superhappykid,wallstreetbets,57.0

Yeah, right. It's getting wrecked, man. IDK what to tell you either. Just watched a ton of money evaporate on this crap. Bezos selling an extra $3bn at $3300 should've been a good sign to get the fuck out.

I don't think this is vaccine news, either. I think this is the Biden presidency repricing, now happening for real.

How is the vaccine a surprise to anyone? I don't get it. Are people going to stop shopping on Amazon because there's a vaccine? Are people looking forward to going back to their supermarkets? Even if the vaccine were approved yesterday, it would take a year or two by the time it got to you and I. How is that different from what we thought would happen?

Was ZOOM priced for a perpetual, until-the-end-of-time pandemic? How does it drop so much on vaccine news alone?

Going to spend like $2,500 on Amazon this Christmas.

B2B, Amazon Music, Twitch growth with Podcasts streaming there, AWS, the logistics side with Prime. Literally shut up.

147,2020-11-10,"Here is why I am bullish and willing to hold long term.

**Monetization of customer data** \- possible 600M EBITDA if leveraged correctly. Why nobody mentions this is beyond me, arguably one of the most important high margin revenue streams GME can benefit from.

**E-Commerce omnichannel business model** that offers same day delivery and is continually improving. This is the ""beat AMZN' part of the business model.

**PC hardware sales** ($40bn/yr and growing TAM)

**Online ad revenue.** From website + App

**E-sports experiences**. Currently partnering with gaming pros and streaming on twitch. Will **build brand recognition**.

Massive **reduction in SG&amp;A.**

**SKU optimization**. Better inventory and inventory turnover.

'Digital everything' is not as strong of a bear thesis as it was 2 years ago. Especially considering GME has the MSFT partnership to share digital revenue.

Gaming industry TAM is growing YoY.

Competent management team. Finally.

Bigger firms/institutions are taking a position in GME. So far as of end of Q3 we have had new or increased stakes from: Senvent, State Street, Russell, Wells Fargo, Hussman and finally Jefferies taking an sizeable position in Call options.

&amp;#x200B;

This is not a $700MM company. This is not the old GME where you simply buy and trade in videogames. It is very undervalued at current market price of $11

I think GME has potential to be valued at $2-3bn valuation within 12 months ($32-47)

When it finally appreciates in value after a few good quarterly earnings then there should be a slow squeeze. You have to be patient with this play. It will most likely take 6+ months until we see good Q4 and Q1 earnings to convince shorts to capitulate.",Stonksflyingup,wallstreetbets,147.0

I actually bought TSLA last dip and that face ripping rally last week did fking nothing for it, it humped 420 on a fking Nasdaq 4% day wtf? NVDA was the play that week. Leaning towards NVDA again. Sub 500 entry.

AMZN seems limp dick too with the vaccine announcement. Will porbably slow its bounce back.

255,2020-11-10,"No one knows the answer to that in the short term. I will tell you this - if Pfizer didn't announce its vaccine yesterday, AMZN would probably had hit 3400 today or already yesterday. Nothing changed about the company so nothing should change in the way you look about it. This ""sector shift"" is a huge overreaction (in my humble opinion at least) and all these cruise lines spiking 40% up will drop again very quickly when the market realises we aren't actually done with Covid.

I wanted to invest and forget about it for a year like I did with APPL, MS, AMZN and VOO. I didn't expect this stock to have a sudden 10% drop right after I bought (crying). Sudden systemic drops like this, however, have a higher likelihood to recover compared to other drops (earnings, legal battles, etc.) Look at the COVID drop in March, the drop in September, etc. So I am optimistic that given 3-6 month period this stock will go back to the $300 range cause its battling a Chinese regulation (a systemic shock to the whole tech sector in China), unlike declining sales, competitors taking it over, or Trump tweeting against it. My one year analysis is that it should overall do better than ETFs (annual 8% return) just because Alibaba is growing faster and looking to invest in many other tech sectors in China as well, which is overall on the incline.  But NONETHELESS, your right that i should have done a gradual investment in it, will keep that in mind going forward for other large trades.",rickyonsteam,wallstreetbets,67.0

It's a flex to show the rest of the tech community that they are not the rulers of country, the CCP is. It has been long believed that the CCP will bolster up their firms to directly compete and BABA as the ""chosen one"". This puts that concept on hold... 

The bigger issue now is, $FB historically has said that Chinese tech giants will eat US tech companies lunch if there's more regulation from the Senate, but with this on the line now, that regulation does not look too bad from the US if China is willing to take the first step.

First things first: buy-and-holding ETFs is generally a much more reliable and lucrative plan vs picking individual stocks. I don't know if a portfolio of these companies below would outperform QQQ over a 20 year horizon. 

I'm sure some of these will be obvious but here's what's in my portfolio / on my watchlist:

**Companies broken down roughly by industry:**

NVDA / AMD / QCOM

AMZN / SHOP (AMZN under or around \~$3,000 and SHOP \~$900 should be solid long term)

SQ

FDX / ODFL

COST

BYND (I'm a BUY ranking around $100-$115 and probably a HOLD over \~$120)

SE / BABA / TCEHY (China's recent antitrust laws for big tech may not bode well for these, will probably divest soon)

EQIX &amp; SPG (would wait for a bit for SPG to fall further during a second wave of lockdowns)

DAL (if theres a dip due to further covid closures. Under $30 is good, under $25 is great, was able to pick up a bunch under $20 earlier this year and would definitely double down if it hits $20 again).

F (the electric F-150 looks promising, and I imagine there's upside here if they have success with it and this is a bit of a Rivian play)

Also everyone here has been writing about NIO and XPEV. I'm in these, but I don't know if they're worth getting into at the current pricing and with China's current tech-space regulatory concerns.

 

**ETFs:**

WCLD

KWEB (same china note applies here too)

ARK's Active ETFs (especially ARKG)

BOTZ 

WUGI (super thinly traded ETF but I use this for exposure to a bunch of the companies listed here)

&amp;#x200B;

**SPACs without targets near NAV:**

Unless your plan is to buy and then sell at the next pump which could happen over the next couple months as we wait for an approved vaccine.

I think 3700c in July is a great target if you think a mass distributed vaccine won't be around yet, but it'll be a pipe dream if the vaccine comes out before then. Tech had a hell of a run up until September, and then the big tech earnings reports at October couldn't lift it back to 3500.

Another bearish consideration is any legislation drawn up to address big tech. That's something with bipartisan support, though the way to address it is not. If Dems win both runoffs in GA then Dems will have House/Senate/POTUS.

The ah dip is coming from my dumbass meme section of shares in NIO pltr GME etc. For those, NIO is still looking like an attractive buy for me on a 90-day term but the other two are just not really supported by anything other than the meme so I may just cut my losses there

52,2020-12-01,"Per your first link VIX is Neutral and is at its lowest level since Covid Started. Also Junk Bonds are showing Fear. I think the market will trade sideway until their is a catalyst which may be the Georgia Election or something else.

Don't over think it. I have seen these doom and gloom articles almost daily if you look for them. PLTR is down because of Citron and because it needed a breather. There are a lot of stocks that are not at their ATHs. I will worry when Big Tech - Amzn, Aapl, FB, Goog, etc hit ATH at the same time like they did Sept 2nd. There is some rotation back into them so keeping my eyes open.

&amp;#x200B;

AMZN - agree for going long, but typically there is a small drop post cyber monday. Definitely gonna hop in the dip. Currently holding puts and my target is 3180 to convert to calls.

&amp;#x200B;

AAPL - Everyone is using AAPL as a way to beat inflation. Because it has huge cash reserves itll always be around so its like an equity turned modern day bond. Really depends on if the dollar recovers or not, but AAPL and DXY should have a semi inverse relationship.",Soybeanrice,wallstreetbets,53.0

It was obvious that ZM was going to crash on ER. Almost every good company - Aapl, Amzn, AMD, NVDA dumped after good/even great numbers. There is no way they could have topped the surprise they had in Q2.

I would keep an eye on FSLY, PLTR, NIO, GME, AMD etc as I think may of them will shoot up tomorrow or Thursday. AMD was just flat after a big day.",neothedreamer,wallstreetbets,54.0

351,2020-12-01,"I guess it's WSB story time.

Chinese companies have been listed on US exchanges since ~2013. All other foreign stocks listed in the US must allow audit by entity called PCAOB. However China has effectively refused to do so but still been allowed to list.

This mostly comes down to TCEHY and BABA been too good for US capital markets to pass up and both being big wins for Wall Street underwriters which have stupid amounts of lobbying power in Washington during this era.

Fast forward to nowish and we have Luckin Coffee. Complete fucking accounting scam that fucked US investors out of a shit ton of coin. This basically soured the Wall Street situation with unaudited Chinese stocks playing on US exchanges. Previously with high quality stocks like BABA/TCEHY this wasn't a problem so Wall Street didn't want to change status quo but this is basically a case of biting the hand that feeds.

Now couple that with Orange Man. He wants some sort of legacy and that is mostly to be hard-line nationalist and ""standing up to China"" (lol). He jumps at the chance to push for delisting and banning of Chinese companies on top of tradewar escalation.

Republicans have had this idea for a while now Mnuchin actually had a policy group suggesting similar changes as to those in the current bill except a bit more lenient, having a built in back door to use US accounting firms in place of PCAOB audit.

So given all this context what exactly does the bill say?

Basically foreign companies (not just Chinese but in practice just Chinese) will be delisted if they haven't been audited by PCAOB for 3 consecutive years. Additionally they must also show they are not under control of a foreign government. So state owned companies as are common in Singapore, China, etc may be affected by this second rule.

BABA is probably the strongest Chinese company. It is a true juggernaut that dwarfs AMZN but trades at a fraction of its multiple because of the ""Chinese discount"". That being said, US investors are fickle and aren't value orientated (as can be seen from the CV19 crash and subsequent market behaviour). So there is a still a good chance it gets hammered down to ~255 on panic selling.

However it's real price should be around ~340 right now even accounting for the Chinese discount. You can't keep that beast down forever so it's going up eventually, just a matter of when.",beefstake,wallstreetbets,351.0

22,2020-12-03,"OP, you clearly put a lot of work into this and I'm just another one from the peanut gallery here but I really don't think WMT is the play.  I'm not as researched as you on this but as a former WMT shareholder and current AMZN shareholder I offer the following:

1. They've been heavy into pharmacy for years.
2. Their online subscription service has already started and the membership numbers aren't blowing anyone's mind.
3. Walmart is the worlds largest retail chain, yes.  It's also US's biggest grocery chain.  So what?

I just want to offer the other side of the coin here.  I know my opinion is no more valid than yours but consider some rebuttals.

1. Amazon pays a lot for storage warehouses which lease for far less than retail space in shopping centers so this is an advantage of Amazon, not an advantage of Walmart.  If Amazon wanted to start offering curbside pickup tomorrow at any one of their warehouses they could and people would happily drive to get their items just lile they currently drive to Walmart.
2. Walmart already offers free shipping to their stores,  the items often show up within 1-2 days (if they're not already in stock) so where the huge value added proposition for Walmart+?
3. Whereas Amazon offers the entire range of a particular product line from cheap and low quality all the way up to expensive and high quality Walmart only offers the low to mid range items.
4. Walmart buys inventory, Amazon does not (except for their own manufactured items.  Walmart employs non-profit employees (ie greeters) and Amazon does not.  Granted, Walmart can return whatever doesn't sell through but there is a cost for doing so.
5. Walmart as a brand is ""Cheap"", not ""Innovative"", and this cannot be overstated enough.  Consider some of the biggest investors over the past several decades, many of them wanted to own good brands as well as good companies.  Note, I didn't say gamblers, but Walmart might be one of the worst tickers for a YOLO gambler type because the stock moves slow both ways.
6. Walmart has nothing of note but retail.  Amazon has AWS which is beyond huge as far as current and future potential and probably some other things I can't think of this moment.

Again, I rarely put contrarian posts up because I don't want to come off as argumentative but I think you should really consider Walmart's potential growth (in stock price) versus so many other companies available to trade.  Just food for thought, thanks for putting up such a great post as far as DD goes and if we agree to disagree that's cool.

218,2020-12-02,"u/FiFiFilms Thanks for sharing.

Of all the points I made the $4B in revenue for their current fiscal year (ends June 2021) seems like the easiest hurdle.  They will hit $1B in revenue this quarter (Q1 Fiscal) - so just staying flat for the next 3 quarters, zero growth, and they get to $4B. 

If AAPL makes a piece of fitness equipment that would be something.  I don't see it but would agree that would derail PTON. AAPL didn't make a car to compete against TSLA either.  I think AAPL has got their focus in the right area for them - chips. The new M1 is something special.  The apple products already integrate into the PTON digital screen.  So far they are playing nice with each other.  AMZN may be more likely to try and copy because they make a generic Amazon Basic version of almost everything. 

Haven't heard from anyone yet that doesn't like the equipment. Have heard some complaints about the wait times and customer service falling short of expectation. 

Being profitable and getting into the S&amp;P is now 550B for TSLA. TSLA is after all - just a car.  Which brings up your most important point.  PTON is just a stationary bike.  I get it - at its core it is just a stationary bike. But when you think of PTON as JUST a stationary bike you also miss the entire larger purpose.  Like calling TSLA just a car you miss everything else that cannot be seen.  I guess that is where shorts and longs fundamentally disagree, the rest is noise.  It is a matter of interpretation.  One guy sees a classic car, another sees a rust bucket, etc.  

Bulls see the potential of PTON as a movement, a community, a social network in and of itself.  Something that blends subscription, healthcare and social media into one. Bears see a fad.

If you only see PTON as a stationary bike and a fad - buy the puts.  But if you can see it as more - then there is a massive runway for success and value has a lot of run to expand, even from today's valuation.",Consistent-Brain-361,wallstreetbets,218.0

125,2020-12-07,"If you look at them like an auto-maker, the valuation isn't there. Expected growth of 25-35% YoY deliveries wouldn't get them to here. However there are a couple other channels that could get you closer.

Basic play 1 - Batteries, as there will be a continued push for improvement of the grid and an emphasis on renewable, the importance of batteries and their density/manufacturability goes up. TSLA is up there in terms of R&amp;D on batteries and can capitalize on this market.

Basic play 2 - Self-driving, you can look at UBER and LYFT and get a feel what analysts think the valuation of self driving technology is. Those are giants whose main hope for profitability is self-driving. This allows them to take on the taxi industry full bore. Throw in the economists wet dream of cars continuously moving and not parking as a replacement for mass transit and you can add this in. TSLA is a leader in this field as well and while there are better products on the market for current day (Volvo/GM(Cadillac Super Cruise) TSLA has a product that's aiming for the next tier.

Intermediate play 3 - Data, this is a massive field that TSLA is primed to capitalize on more than any other automaker. The ability to capture real time data about the car and it's surroundings and how the driver interacts puts almost all TSLA drivers into a beta tester roll. This allows TSLA to build better algorithms and then be able to package these to desiring customers.

Intermediate play 4 - Insurance, as evidenced by AMZN and the new ""lease"" programs where everything is included, companies with a large enough bankroll (or access to one) can massively disrupt the traditional insurance mold. This is a massive financial play, and one where TSLA is better equipped through their data to have a better actuary table. Insurance when done right (meaning more data and the ability to process it) is massively profitable and opens up massive doors for reinvestment of said capital (see BRK). 

Grabbing 4 players in each of the 4 (Panasonic, Volvo, Palantir, Progressive) and would have a market cap of 150B. TSLA at 600B still seems like an overpay, but it's a much more feasible one if you view these fields as growing or at least profitable at a growth rate of 30% (see TSLA's targeted YoY delivery rate).",scbtl,wallstreetbets,125.0

Gme is a retailer.  Please name one retailer than actually innovates and creates net value. It is about creating a brand and making a margin on someone else's products. Only one that is close is maybe Amzn and they really have a completely different part of their business that is actually a tech play. The also sell their own ""store brands"".

Gme is a value play on a company that is undervalued because almost everyone is underestimating their value.  Kind of like how Nordstrom went up on Earnings that were less bad than the street was expecting.

So now it's just waiting on FDA's approval, and while I do think their RSNA show was successful, it's gonna take a while to see it moving. Any FDA's approval will give huge profit, but on the mean time, there is also chance that FDA might disapprove the application. It will probably take some time. 

I definitely agree with their cause that analytical should be almost free to nothing. This is like AMZN starting to deliver all packages for free and within 2 days, but it's long way ahead.

43,2020-12-09,"Anyone concerned with AMZN?

I use Amazon FBA for selling product as a small business, but they didn't accept much into their warehouses besides essentials for a while. 

By the time I had my Holiday inventory, I didn't trust they would get it into their warehouses (they were always delayed when I did send them shit). 

And if it wasn't delayed, I was worried they would have to shut down ""non-essential"" shit again where they only accept TP and hand sanitizer into their warehouses again.

As a result, I did 90% Shopify 5% Amazon 5% Etsy this year vs last year maybe 70% shopify / 30% non-Shopify.

eBay did shitty last year and this year.

Used FB for ads that were super profitable, Shopify, and saw a huge bump in Etsy for Xmas.

Amazon has become our office supply store, but wonder if other independent businesses did the same thing for Xmas.

9,2020-12-10,"For a good company like amzn you're probably fine, and days like today are exactly why you should buy the options that are a month or two out. Even if a month ago you bought the same strike for the calls that were expiring this week you would be fine because realistically, you would have sold them last week when amzn was at 3200!

To make more use of your money with less capital and you still want the ITM calls, you should buy call spreads. Just briefly in case you don't know how they work, for the same date you buy one call and you sell another with a higher strike. So basically you pay the difference between the call's current prices prices and as long as the stock expires above the higher strike you will be able to sell them at the difference of the strikes. 

For amzn right now you if you believe it will be above 3020 by 1/15/2021 you can buy the 3015 call for 181.75 and sell the 3020 call for 178.5 so total cost is 3.25. Then if amzn is above 3020 on 1/15/2021, since they will both be ITM you will be able to sell them for the difference of the strikes which is 5. Thus you've turned 3.25 into 5. This way you can play the ITM options for $325 instead of $17850.",steakandp1e,wallstreetbets,9.0

I think I have enough time to carry the bags for a while and come out fine. I’m not saying you’re wrong because you’re not. But it takes more capital to buy the options you’re suggesting have less risk so when they’re down, it’s a lot of money.

73,2020-12-09,"I’ve been on here talking about that weak ass price action in AMZN that’s been going on beneath the surface for weeks. Looks like today it finally got hit with some decent selling. Could see it falling well south of $2500 in the not too distant future. Now that AAPL has its new product announcements and two double upgrades in the rear view it too can continue down. I expect it to be sub $100 soon. Last but not least bulls are balls deep in CRM, totally convinced it’s the buy of the century and yet all it does is go down on large volume. Weakness in megacap tech can’t be overstated. It’s been waiting to drop. OTM puts 1-2 months out if the selling continues for a few days are easy money imo. Given the weakness once it gets some momentum to the downside those names could fall a loooong way. Also since everyone is convinced S&amp;P won’t drop before next year makes me interested in a contrary stance that we get a nice break before the end of the year.

I’m not doing anything yet because I’ve been burned one too many times jumping the gun on this for the past couple of months and believe there will be plenty of time to position for this as the bulls fall over themselves to BTD but I will be positioning for this soon if the weakness continues.",dkrich,wallstreetbets,73.0

- the partnership with MSFT. it doesn't add up. why would they give a dying company a cut of the sales? could sony also join them in order to compete?

- the shelf registration. it implies a price move upwards. if it wasn't going to move up, then why not issue shares at the current price? it also may indicate some sort of announcement, which would act as a catalyst. a platform? new products? new business strategy? who knows

36,2020-12-12,Amzn dropped roughly 10 percent when a vaccine was announced. I just hope the fda approval was priced in and its not gonna drop more bruhhh,BigDOooooot,wallstreetbets,36.0
37,2020-12-12,"Covid stocks are gonna continue to get pounded; ZM, PTON, DOCU, W, RH, LULU, CVNA, even AMZN.  i think people are gonna try to chase those highs in Aug and Oct but they’re gonna constantly fade out, traders/buyers are gonna get frustrated and give up. charts of W, PTON and ZM definitely look like a big time downtrend with Aug being the top.   

I think they also have a potential to drag down a lot of tech especially if Telsa busts.  In 2000, When bubble popped, everything went down, even good companies.  INTC and CSCO are still below what they were in 2000.",spacebizzle,wallstreetbets,37.0

40,2020-12-12,"People really said that every year since tho. When did you get in the market? When I bought AMZN, SHOP, SQ, TSLA, NVDA, AAPL, in 2017 to 2018, people literally said the same thing on every single one of these. Now that I'm up 200% to 1000% on these, you are telling that a 50% market crash is going to wipe me out? Iunno man. 

It's one thing to say TSLA *might* drop to $200. It's another to say TSLA is gon drop to $50, which is the price I got it at and just 2 years ago, when everyone and their mom said its waaaay too overvalued. How are you so sure this won't happen for another 2 years, and how can you know how big the crash of the bubble is? 

I see very few worlds where people are sitting out since 2018 can somehow get back at me when shit goes down. And if you are going to say ""well 2018 wasn't that bad, I'm talking about 2020 only"", then all I'm saying is I've literally heard the exact same thing in 2018 compared to 2016, and 2016 compared to 2014. Every year has been the peak of the bubble since early 2010s. I never know where y'all people have so much confidence in your takes.",slbaaron,wallstreetbets,40.0
