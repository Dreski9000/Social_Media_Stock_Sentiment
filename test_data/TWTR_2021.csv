This big tech censorship is scary though. I would expect something like this from the Chinese Communist Party, but not in the US, let alone the president. 

Big tech is not shutting down these accounts due to 'risk', they're trying to control what is read and thought. Otherwise, we would have already seen numerous dictator accounts, the CCP, Ayatollah's account, BLM accounts, etc., removed.

Thousands of conservative accounts have been purged today. A couple of prominent conservative twitters pages have lost 60k+ followers today from the purge.

3. Trump gave Twitter a huge pump. How many times did he almost started armageddon via Twitter. He dispensed insults against world leaders via Twitter. He was the candid loose cannon, unscripted, must-see, turnt up train-wreck that raised platform engagement. He has 80 mil followers compared to Biden‚Äôs 8 mil.

It was a huge blunder, potentially costing them tens of billions of dollars.  Considering they are already unprofitable, and this will only lead more users to leave and more advertisers to leave, I can't in good faith endorse anyone to buy shares of them.

Twitter will eventually go to zero.  They opened pandoras box and they will soon learn that only 20-30% of this country practices the politics they endorse.  They refuse to accommodate anyone else in favor of their own bias, and that will be the end of them.

That just doesn't make sense.  Their revenue growth has been modest ($2.5 bill in 2016 to $3.5 bill in 2019, and slightly less this year).  The platform is not great for ad revenue generation or potential growth opportunities.  It does not compare to Facebook's or Google.  I own shares of these but will divest of FB soon because of the risk of muted share price growth and other better opportunities.  But I don't think FB will go down, or that much.  TWTR I do though because the market will predict yrs into the future.  Do I really think it will go bankrupt this year or next? NO.  But I think there is very limited opportunity for appreciation in stock price, and lots of downside risk.",stylishskunk,wallstreetbets,16.0

It is the communicator of the world. And Jack has the power to silence anyone he wants, even the most powerful entities, he just proved it this weekend. 

So now that he already controls communication, I believe that his goals with $SQ is to control all of commerce by creating one universal monetary system for the entire world(rule4).

Once he controls communication + commerce, it is GGs. No one will even see it coming or even  realize the magnitude of his power, it's actually quite admirable.

It will go up and down in value based on all the different variables a stock faces and can be sold for a profit or loss at any time prior to expiration. For example, I bought a 62/59 covered call exp 2/19 on $TWTR yesterday and paid a $125 premium for that call. Today, the stock skyrocketed first thing in the morning in anticipation of positive earnings news and the call was worth $245. I sold it for a quick 95% profit in under 24 hrs. I could have held onto it until expiration next Friday, but the stock could easily go up or down within that timeframe, so no certainty it will be above that 62 strike on 2/19 and realize its full $300 value. I usually sell options at 50+ % profit unless its really, really ITM and letting it expire makes more sense. As the saying goes, no one has ever gone broke taking profit.

46,2021-02-12,"/u/RunSpecialist9916 did a great breakdown - read his first. Mine's a wall of text but hopefully will help you understand the mania of what I'm doing. Note that I'm down lifetime 95% because of YOLOs and other stupid shit most people here do. This strategy I've rarely failed at because I'm actually on the spectrum and I'm right a lot on the immediate direction something will go and this allows me to take advantage of that even without having daytrades available.

First, you should probably already know that if you feel the underlying will go down, you either buy a put or sell a call, and if you feel it will go up, you buy a call or sell a put. That's important for understanding things, because the purpose of legging into spreads vs. buying both legs simultaneously is you're repeatedly betting on the immediate next direction but in different ways and you're getting rewarded when you're right.

My goal is to have bets going both ways to sort of be insulated from price movement affecting me too much. In fact, the strong price movement that wrecks everyone here all the time will benefit me if I'm doing things right, and lack of movement would generally be bad, but I'm doing these plays on volatile stocks and my plays are locking in profit so at worst, I'll lose some profit. TLRY especially was juicy yesterday - 40% down in a matter of a couple of hours is about as big of a downward movement as you'll ever see, and swings both ways were massive. My initial call spreads were at 39/40 and I'm still up on them because of how I timed them.

Something else to explain - why debit spreads and not credit spreads? Hard to say - matter of preference and I feel it's a bit easier to deal with logistically because calculations get tougher when you're dealing with tied up collateral with credit spreads. Also, to do what I'm doing with credit spreads, I'd need to start with ITM long calls or puts and it's harder to get enough gain to feel good about getting the 2nd leg, and it cost more vs. starting with ATM or slightly OTM long calls or puts.

What everyone always gets wrong though is that with debit spreads, theta works against you and with credit spreads, theta works for you. Nope. Not true at all. The real truth: ANY spread has theta working FOR you IF they are ITM. That's vitally important, because for instance I have TLRY put debit spreads that are ridiculously ITM, and because of the high IV, they weren't at full profit yesterday, but they likely would be today even if TLRY started up a couple bucks. THIS is why you do spreads - if you had puts and TLRY went up a couple bucks, you'd fucking hate yourself.

So to walk through what I'd done yesterday, I started with a directional bet that TLRY would go up, after it was down 40% in a practical straight line down. Nothing goes down forever, and the outlook for weed companies IS strong, so I think investors will see a sudden deal once it's down 40%, especially. Do I think it'll end up above 40% down by the end of the day? Not necessarily. But I feel if it went further down, it would bounce back a bit first. This happens all the time and is pretty natural.

So I do that, and it goes up. Yay. Now if I had $25k and could freely daytrade, I might just sell the call. Easy peasy profit, cover girl. But I don't. What are the 2 next best things? Buy puts going the other way (ideally straddle, i.e. at the same strike price, but slight strangles are fine too) OR get the 2nd leg of your spread. I like the latter because I'm more protected if the price suddenly goes flat for a while. If I have a straddle or strangle, theta is boning me if the price goes flat. If I'm losing on a debit spread, theta is still working against me, but not as fiercely. And if say the price was right between the strikes of my spread, theta is really only working against me if IV is dropping. Which perhaps it was in the latter half of the day, but with movement like it had, IV would not have a sudden drop really.

Now with the call debit spread in play, what do I do? If I think it's going to keep going up, I can wait a bit and then buy puts. If I think I timed the call sale exactly right, I could buy puts right then. Experts don't like legging and would say immediately finish the play, which is getting debit spreads in the other direction. The end goal is a reverse iron condor or reverse iron butterfly. Experts love those because experts are theta gang and think markets are lame and never do anything. I think these days, shit's moving pretty wildly and I'm playing wildly moving stocks, so I want to bet on that movement and I'm doing the spread equivalent of straddles/strangles to capitalize on that.

Now, you might ask - what if IMMEDIATELY when you buy that first call, shit goes south? That can happen, and that's when you end up taking the most risk, because you ride the gamblers' fallacy and double down or possibly more after it's dropped enough. The gamblers fallacy is that the roulette wheel isn't likely to hit black several times in a row, so you keep betting red with increasingly larger bets until it hits red. Everything is by feel - say I hit TLRY when it was around 46-47 and I watched it fall to 44 after my call. The good news? IV is sky high, so I didn't really lose much on the call.

Quick aside on that - high IV makes everything more expensive, so % wise things aren't moving in as big of % swings. That's why you sometimes see ridiculous shit like a meme stock going up 200% and the calls only went up 700-800%, while shit like ABBV or SBUX moves up 5% and calls made like 2000%. Why not just play SBUX and ABBV then? Well low IV is actually more dangerous. You're watching an iceberg move and every penny against you hits you like a dagger. More than once yesterday, TLRY moved over $1 - over 2.5-3% against me, and I was like nbd - more calls/puts, Pierre!

Anyways, shit potentially moving against you right from the start is why at the start of doing this, you don't want to invest most of your account. It's also why YOLOing in general is stupid. You have no recourse if something moves against you - you have to take the full L, or leg into a debit or credit spread for a higher price and probably watch yourself lose more and feel like a dumbass.

You're dabbling initially, because the absolute ultimate goal would be to get into these debit spreads for free or a credit, which basically means locking in profits and continually making more plays, but in this case, in both directions so come tomorrow when you can unwind your position, you'll still be profitable.

So if you have to double down, then you're looking for about enough movement in the right direction to get into the debit spreads for about as good a price or better price than if you didn't leg into them. The good thing about doubling down is if the price went right back to where it was, you just won.

So then what if you leg into your spread and shit careens in the right direction? In one sense, it sort of sucks, because it means you could've waited longer to leg into it and you'd be bathing in riches. BUT it's still great, because then you can start legging into the spreads going the other way for cheap.

The last part of the strategy to understand is protecting your plays. Say I have 10 spreads going both ways and the price is closer to my call spread, so my call spread is worth a bunch more. If the price moved down, I would lose money. In the words of Keanu Reeves, LOSE? I DON'T LOSE! I WIN! I'M A LAWYER, THAT'S MY JOB, THAT'S WHAT I DO! So I load up on more puts, which are now cheaper. Ideally, I'd load up on enough of them to make the value of the puts and put spreads about what the value of the call spreads are, but I pretty much just do things by what feels right, because you can't sit there all day calculating.

The key to this is, the price oscillates on everything pretty much all day. Even if something is predominantly going up or down, like TLRY going down yesterday, there are still swings, and once you have both call and put debit spreads in place, you can make it so those oscillations are helping you pretty much every step of the way.

One last important thing to know is that the next day, you have to unwind your position. Which you do again by legging out of course! Dangerous? Yes, but like legging into them, you can make more if you time things right, or end up in new spreads if you time things wrong like I did on TWTR yesterday (and I ended up maybe 20-30% on TWTR yesterday after being down 20% at the low point because I got out of the puts too early and watched it sink and my call spreads lose a fair bit. I bought new calls, took advantage of bounce back, legged those into spreads, bought puts, took advantage of oscillation down, legged those into spreads, and added a bit to each as time went).

He navigates to his bookmarks to find his favorite cuck porn help him relieve the swelling rage, anger, and fear that have been building within him over the past two months.  How much more of this can I take he wonders and he manually stimulates himself to cuck porn while his wife and her boyfriend begin round six in the next room over, all the while tears streaming down his face.  Finally after several hours he achieves a sweet release however his anger still remains balled up inside him.  In a fit of rage he throws his $IBM toughbook to the floor and pulls out his $T $AAPL iPhone and heads over to $TWTR where he goes on an 18 tweet rant about the retards on WSB before he finally passes out after his 9th $BUD.",ContestImpressive,wallstreetbets,1.0

Bought GME puts after the first run up. Sold them too early for 20% gain. Immediately Yolo‚Äôd weekly puts on Chegg and TWTR ahead of earnings. That‚Äôs the 85% decline. Riskier yolo twtr calls as it kept going up got me back to nearly even. 

Put whole account into RKT. As it went up that one big day, I figured it would find a new level around 30ish so I held it, and sold covered calls at 50 which were rich. Bought them back for big gain as I promptly lost the gain on the shares which plummeted back to prior levels. 

Bull put spreads on RKT as it found support in the low mid 20‚Äôs.

One day yolo on SQ calls when it dipped into the 190‚Äôs.

Bought ASO calls. Sold for no gain before they tripled.

WSB is not known for backing GOOD plays either though so take it with a grain of salt.   


1) Your buy-in price isn't bad. $53.64 is already profitable today ($54 at time of post).   


2)You are \~33$ below ATH, which does give you visible upside.   


3)It is doubtful Twitter would fall too much lower quickly from where it is at.   


Do I think this is a good play? No.   


However, it is not the worst one I have seen so far. Taking a 2nd mortgage on your house (if true) for Twitter is pretty stupid BUT you bought shares and not options so you will be able to save value (probably).   


Honestly, there are WAY better plays out there for a YOLO. TWTR really hasn't done much since debut, their PPC is not as cost-effective as rival platforms, and companies are worried about the toxic content so are wary of advertising.   


In the end, it is not as bad as the forum comments would make it out to be.   


If I were to YOLO (and I do) I would go for something like the Proterra/Arclight merger (buy shares but 6/18 call options are for the REAL tendies.....and losses).   


Even a play on UWMC (or RKT if you are a RKT bro).

Added some Clne positions will add more next week if it looks like it has found a bottom but down 50% on Sept $12s.

Jumped into Pltr $22C for May 14th and 21st.  Bleeding.  I should have put stoplosses on it but thought it would go up more the next day.  Saw the exit at about 15% gain but let it ride next day. Lesson learned, always stoploss to secure profit, minimize loss. Hoping for a solid Monday or I will have to cut losses.

Already been in Baba for a while running PMCC, going to expand position and be careful of how far otm the CC are in case it runs.

Same with Aapl.

Added some CAT today.  Going to set stoploss on Monday and see if it will run anymore.  Saw that you just exited. Even right now.

Added KMI, seems to be solid.  PMCC on this one because is seems to be a tortoise stock (slow and steady) with good gains already.

On the wrong side with Tsla, TSM, Pton, Twtr (after drop).  Looking to exit about where you want to short it. TSM seems to be a good PMCC stock because it just hangs around $115 to $122.

Planning to add ON Long and some shorts on PCG, Dash, Bynd, Afrm, Cisco, QS next week.

Also saw a comment earlier that ZM is a buy under $300 but I have been bleeding on it the last week just got out yesterday. Looks like it is in a downward trend down.

With a customer acquisition cost of $8, it appears to take almost 2 years for payback.  Elite businesses should payback in 3-6 months.  Based on these economics, Nextdoor might have very limited economic value.

Once filed to the SEC that it ""has never made money, and might never achieve, nor maintain, profitability""

0,2021-08-04,"GME made me about $900k (looking back I could have played it better and made a lot more, but it was wild. Double dipped on GME - Jan and Feb)

AMC - like $120k

LMND, AMD, DPZ and some other base hits of like $35 to 50k.

Right now I am down like $130k on CLNE, but waiting for it to recover. I hit $1.4M again on CLNE in June but didn't close out and lock in gains of about $350k.  Some other plays I am down like 50% on that I think will recover include HNST, SOFI, ROOT, Twtr, NVDA (PUTS).

You have to know how to sell the big winners and when not to sell CC.

Biggest win was GME the first time. Sold a bunch premature and had over 8k  shares locked in Covered Calls that cost me at least $2 to $3M in upside. Learned that if Options go deep ITM you want to roll the strike up. I had some April $15 that I rolled up to July $85C and it probably made me an extra couple hundred k (deep itm calls have a delta close to 1 so they act almost exactly like shares).

My best win was $20k in option on GME I bought around 2/19 to 2/23 that I sold on 2/25 for $170k. If I would have waited until 3/12 it would have easily been 2.5x that.
