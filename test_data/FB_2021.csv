This would be like if Facebook or Apple refused to give information regarding 9/11. They were a legitimate threat to national security.

Europe/US just bombs the Middle East by saying Iraq has nukes and openly comitting war crimes for 30 years.

&gt;I stated clearly China enables IP theft while the world doesn't.

It's called skills transfer. Are interns IP theft from companies? You sound like a salty ass ""They took our jobs"" kind of poor man.

&gt;Except they're actually taken to court and dragged through the process for stealing IP.

It's called skills transfer, which is what happens when you outsource. India is acquiring these skills as well.

Imagine if the world could take the UK/US to the world for 100 years of occupation.

Whatever poors, this is wsb. I just said there was a reason China banned FB/G and not MSFT. Then you started going on a rant about how China is the sole reason for the decline of West and not BRRRRRRR for the markets.

8,2021-01-08,"Great DD. Solid. Thick. Tight. 

Let me add some analysis to your post on why FB is guaranteed to fail, and relatively soon:  


&gt;1. Facebook can't continue it's previous growth. Simply put they are running out of people on earth qualified to join (have connectivity) and an interest. Once you hit market saturation, you slow down. Unfortunately for them, the US economy is fixated on the idea of growth. Being successful or profitable isn't as important as growth. Growth is what makes the stock go up. How will they deal with this problem? They'll need to they can come up with a plan to show growth in something other than users. 

&gt;2. Facebooks original demographic is disenchanted. It's no longer elite, private, interesting. It's noisy, commercial, public. Who wants to friend their grandmother? Who wants their aunt seeing their drunken mistakes from the night before?

&gt;3. People get bored of things after a while. People get bored of things on the internet even faster.

&gt;4. Facebook's only major perk was ""keeping you in touch"", but the cost was privacy and oversharing. Several alternatives are popping up with a lower cost across all of Facebook's platforms. 

&gt;5. People prefer less intrusive tools. The best tools are the least intrusive. The reason the cell phone is superior to the landline is it doesn't tie you to a location. The reason a car is superior to a horse is it doesn't require as much maintenance, can go faster for longer. Facebook is very time intensive for the gain of ""keeping in touch"". That goes back to cost... is it worth it? Do you really care if you're in touch with someone you were in 3rd grade with?


Facebook is doomed right? 

**No, this is a copy of some dunce's post from 2011** who claimed Facebook was on the verge of death. Nostradamus here went 0 for 5: https://www.quora.com/Is-Facebook-dying-in-popularity/answer/Robert-Accettura

Facebook has had unrelenting Q/Q and YoY growth in users and revenue since this turd DD from 2011. And it continued to grow in users and revenue through the 2016 Cambridge Analytica scandal. 

And it continued to grow in users and revenue through the 2018 Russian Influence campaigns congressional hearings. 

And it continued to grow (surprise) various scandals in 2019 and 2020, dozens of ""delete facebook"" campaigns on social media in the last 5 years, and most importantly including a large, coordinated effort between dozens of big name companies to completely stop running ads on Facebook. 

*And it's still growing* and maintaining absurdly large profit margins.  It's a money printing machine.

any weight workout that results in pain (apart from normal soreness) is usually due to one of three reasons:  

* bad technique - do the above
* too much weight (usually resulting in bad technique) - reduce weight until your technique is absolutely perfect
* underlying injury - heal up before putting strain on the joint again

some general advice: go fuckin light until you have absolutely mastered the movement. even swings are easy to get wrong. your arms should do literally zero work during swings. they're just there to keep the bell from flying off into space, it's your ass that does all the work during a swing. more complex movements like windmills or turkish get-ups take shoulders through a range of motion while loaded with weight and shouldn't be taken lightly. do that shit holding a tennis ball until you get the movement right or you're gonna fuck yourself up good.

I feel like I'm missing something, but how is GME going to be the next eCommerce website when there are already more convenient alternatives and GME hasn't invested enough in online infrastructure and at this point is at least 10 years behind? If anything I think we would be jumping at Epic Games for becoming the biggest disruptor in the videogame industry over the last 2 years with Fortnite and launching their own store capable of competing with Steam due to brand exclusivity and the amount of free games they give away. What engineering has GME invested in their online platform that gives them a better edge than AMZN? Youtube and Twitch are huge markets for video game content already that can be leveraged and integrated with their own marketplace. Newegg tried the Amazon approach by allowing 3rd party sellers and flopped hard. I don't understand the appeal of GME unless you ignore the rest of the video game industry. Even Facebook is better positioned than GME with their own streaming platform, Oculus, and they already have a gaming marketplace with crappy javascript games that print money (btw I don't think FB gaming is good, just that on the surface it looks more promising than GME).

The platform is not great for ad revenue generation or potential growth opportunities.  It does not compare to Facebook's or Google.  I own shares of these but will divest of FB soon because of the risk of muted share price growth and other better opportunities.  But I don't think FB will go down, or that much.

This is one of those gut calls, to be honest. I am getting increasingly familiar with the average american's intelligence, and from what I know about intensely competitive environments, the people who emerge from those contests tend to have a) a lot of energy and b) a lot of brains to either adapt to what followers expect to hear or to actually lead on important issues.

my unpopular opinion above was specificially that these American politicians, who do care a lot about the idea of ""American Leadership(TM)"" despite the rhetoric they may spew, have strong internal biases to ensure American companies lead the world, which implies their regulatory interests won't undermine the revenue opportunity or threaten their overall existence.

moreover, I believe these tech companies are immune somewhat regulation from a revenue standpoint. the franchises are in place and will be cash flowing for a long time.

last point, even if companies like FB can't swoop in and buy out their competitors wholesale, I do believe that fractional ownership of upstarts will still be possible.

It cannot be a new product, why would Apple announce something like the car (a huge deal) on CBS of all places? Its not even an Apple event.

The fact that Tim Cook is sitting down with a journalist tells me this is some kind of a nuanced point he wants to explain to the country, through a journalist. Not a flashy new product. He probably wants to nuke google, facebook's Ad business models and wants to explain why Apple is doing it. To counter FB's one-page ads and the future deluge of ads whining about this. He wants to go infront of national media and make his case.

In light of recent events in the capitol, there is already a lot of anger against FB and other social media companies. If there ever was a time to go against them and get the public's support, this is it.

The breakeven price depends a lot on the implied volatility the options market get to around earnings date. IV is probably going to rise up until the earnings day then drop like a rock the couple days after earnings. So, before the earnings come out on Jan 27th, I think the breakeven is around $278 (10% IV rise built in). On Jan 28th, the day after earnings, I project IV to be about the same as it is right now, on that day, the breakeven will be around $286.

Twitter/FB have banned Antifa related accounts and hashtags that spread misinformation or called for violence back in June.  Getting factchecked is a bitch ain't it


-----


 Other misinformation and misleading claims spread across Twitter on Sunday night and into Monday related to the protests.


Two hashtags that trended worldwide on Twitter falsely claimed that there was a ""cover-up"" or a ""blackout"" of protests in Washington, D.C., overnight. Both appeared to insinuate that protesters have been silenced in some way, perhaps by a secret internet blackout.

Twitter says it has removed the trend from its ""trending topics"" section because of ""coordinated attempts to disrupt the public conversation"" around the protests.

Twitter said it suspended several hundred accounts and is investigating the viral spread of the hashtag, which it said was boosted by ""hundreds of spammy accounts.""

""We're taking action proactively on any coordinated attempts to disrupt the public conversation around this issue,"" a Twitter spokesperson said.

The spokesperson said the company sometimes pulls down hashtags that violate the company's rules, like platform manipulation.",RationallyXuberant,wallstreetbets,95.0

105,2021-01-12,"&gt; you aren't even talking about hand tracking ffs. WHy? because facebook doesnt have any worth a damn so they don' t advertise. Finger, or even full body tracking is all available on steam.

Facebook has true hand tracking since it actually tracks your fingers in a continuous state, not just in several states like Valve Index. They even advertised this with a video focused on it and it also plays a part in their other promotional videos.

Not to mention their research on improving hand-tracking done the road is far beyond anyone else in terms of what has been shown publicly. They are also researching true full body tracking using cameras at a level far beyond anything SteamVR could offer with their current solution - and certainly in a much more convenient way as strapping Vive pucks to yourself is not what mainstream consumers want. 

&gt; Devs aren't going to stick with FB and have been jumping ship.

On the contrary, it's the opposite way around. Devs receive the best sales on the Oculus Quest platform (counting Quest 1 and 2). It has the most active userbase with 500k active Quest 2 Rec Room users, and that headset only launched a few months ago.

&gt; Facebook wants too much and they're going to eat shit because of it.

If Oculus gets broken away from Facebook then yeah, but in terms of the actual consumer decisions and what products they choose to purchase, Oculus has been the number one headset of choice for a while now, and that is unlikely to change outside of Apple coming in, because Facebook's tech is just priced too well, and their research is just too far ahead.",DarthBuzzard,wallstreetbets,105.0

Devs aren't going to stick with FB and have been jumping ship. The only things in VR that exist for facebook are exclusives they bought out wqhich isn't going to buoy them. 

Facebook won't allow in app streaming because they want 30% of the costs which would make it entirely unprofitable so they've killed off entire swathes of apps.

even though higher corporate &amp; uber-wealthy taxes are coming, buying the dip on big tech (MSFT / AAPL / FB / GOOG) is the right play.

On Reddit, an anonymous community, if you want it to be, people ask honest questions and receive honest responses.  People are vulnerable, and sharing in this community because they don‚Äôt fear judgement.  I have seen people use their disguises identify to spread useful information that has been hard to find anywhere else.  I have read heart warming responses to people asking for help, an act in of itself that is hard for a lot of people.  Here on Reddit, I‚Äôve seen nothing but people using their assumed identity to help others and any Russian Disrupters would say they were in their name.

36,2021-02-03,"The problem is that most people rely on traditional media to get their information. When it is so easy for the hedge funds to manipulate the message being parroted by this traditional media it becomes a source of disinformation instead. Even worse, that they claim the source is wallstreetbets, when it is really the likes of Citron pulling the strings.

So what can be done?. Firstly, exactly what OP is doing: contact the journalists. Most of the journalists aren't nefarious, just lazy and/or pressed for time. It's easy for them to republish what another news outlet says. All Citron needs to do is to corrupt one of them and the fake news will spread uncontested, unless there is a dissenting view. We all need to be that dissenting view.

Also, contact any journalism regulator or watchdog entity if they exist and complain about misleading/false articles. For example in Norway there is an industry watchdog called PFU (Pressens faglige utvalg . ""The press' professional group"" roughly translated. Anyway many Norwegian redditors have complained to the watchdog about the fake SLV articles released by mainstream norwegian financial media:

[Norske Reddit-brukere klager E24 inn til PFU: - Stoler blindt p√• amerikanske nettaviser | Kampanje](https://kampanje.com/medier/2021/02/norske-reddit-brukere-klager-e24-inn-til-pfu---stoler-blindt-pa-amerikanske-nettaviser/)

I don't know if there are similar agencies in other countries, but if there are that is an avenue to fight the disinformation.

Another is to bypass traditional media and spread our message across broader social media. I'm talking Twitter, FB, Snap, IG etc. While distasteful to interact with compared to reddit (especially FB), all these other social media platforms has a broader reach than just reddit alone can have.",ultimatox,wallstreetbets,36.0

I used [random.org](https://random.org) to pick a number with ""$SPY green tomorrow"" being odd and ""$SPY red tomorrow"" being even and I got 142, 622, 976, 904, and 211 so I'm going with an 80% possibility that $SPY will close lower than today's closing price.

Results for $PLTR:

954, 207, 25, 435, and 469. Palantir is looking pretty bullish for tomorrow with odds of going up at 80%.

Tarot card for $SPY:

Upright Judgment. *""The traditional Judgement meaning focuses on the moment when we reflect and evaluate ourselves¬†and our actions. It is through self-reflection that we can have a clearer and objective understanding about where we are now, and what we need to do in order to grow as humans. The Judgement card appearing in a reading signifies that you are coming close to this¬†significant point in your life where you must start to evaluate yourself.¬†""*

I take this as meaning that there will be some sort of catalyst tomorrow and even if SPY falls we will see gains in green energy stocks, EV, etc.

Tarot card for $PLTR:

Upright Tower. Oh wow, keywords for this one are pretty negative: disaster, destruction, upheaval, trauma, sudden change, chaos. *""The Tower represents¬†change in the most radical and momentous sense. It is for this reason that the card itself visually looks so unnerving. But it doesn't necessarily have to be truly¬†frightening or ominous. Because at the heart of this card, its message is foundational, groundbreaking change.""*

My call for tomorrow: $FB and $PLTR reveal a partnership, Zuck and Karp have combined their respective data and data mastery and can accurately predict the locations and actions of all human beings down to an extremely granular level. The stock market is now useless and trading is halted permanently. PLTR and FB shareholders are the new controlling class with your societal rank determined by the amount of shares you hold.",marky6045,wallstreetbets,6.0

53,2021-02-08,"No. Just no.

GameStop‚Äôs stock price (all stock prices really) should reflect investor‚Äôs confidence in the abilities of the company to generate revenue.

(1) Target consumer. If you‚Äôve worked at GameStop you know who that is. Outside of the holiday season GameStop‚Äôs bread and butter comes from a demographic of people who probably have no business spending $60 on a game. Because that $60 exceeds income:entertainment ratio of any normal responsible individual (people with bills to pay). When you turn around and get $30 for a game you just spent $60 because you forgot you had to pay rent... there is a problem. That low income irresponsible individual is GameStop‚Äôs target demographic. People who wouldn‚Äôt normally drop $60 on a game from a regular retailer who provides no option to recoup those funds.

(2)For the educated consumer who recognizes that it is better to get something for a game you‚Äôre done with in 12 hours rather than it sit collecting dust. GameStop can provide a decent value. (Or used to). The problem is that outside a B2G1F sale or additional value on trades when you roll that into a pre-order. You can almost always get more selling that game secondhand. OfferUp, CL, FB marketplace, etc.

Most customers know they aren‚Äôt getting the value for the games and consumers don‚Äôt like being screwed.

Developers don‚Äôt like GameStop either. The relationship for many years has been on the rocks for years because for every used copy sold by GameStop, the developer loses a sale.

To combat that most developers have moved to a digital delivery, effectively cutting out the retailer altogether. In the past few years we‚Äôve seen Sony and Microsoft alike buying up developers studios, further cutting out pieces of the supply chain and increasing their own profits.

In most recent years the only true value has been a physical copy vs a digital copy. Which is made further irrelevant by large downloads, and at times activation codes.

GameStop‚Äôs really only play here is provide a type of streaming or digital delivery service. Do which they are 100% fighting an uphill battle competing against the 3 major providers themselves Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo.

In terms of games and catering to the above mentioned demographic. They‚Äôre really only play would be to provide limited access to titles digitally. Essentially a digital GameFly.

One smart play that GameStop made was catering to nerdom. Which is a very niche market, and you run into the same age old issue that merchandisers have dealt with from the beginning merchandise real estate/shelf space... and movement.

GameStop is not worth $1000. This is honestly some of the worst DD I‚Äôve ever read. The smart play was to short GME. GME IS on its way out, and this short squeeze wasn‚Äôt ever about GME... it was about catching wallstreet with their pants down and their dicks in a gloryhole.

When the fad dies out GME will go under, and WSB will have been nothing but a speed bump in its inevitable demise.",Shire_Hobbit,wallstreetbets,53.0

Long term by definition is over one year, but in the grand scheme of things, one year is a very short investment.  A lot of us are making money really fast, so we look at something 6 months down the line as a long term play, but its not.  Long term means five years minimum, but really 10-20 years.  I have had Netflix and FB for 6-7 years and have made amazing money over time.  They have good periods and bad periods, but over time they always win.  Significantly.

The weed industry is barely getting started.  Getting in on ANY weed stock and holding it for 5 years will he a good investment.  Like Coca-Cola in the 1900s or IMB in the 1950s or Apple in the 1980s.

PLTR is either a buy-and-hold play (I'm in a shade above $15 so I can take a big hit and keep truckin) or an aggressive bet on a sudden earnings uptick.

The only thing I will say about the DD, is the link you're making between it and AMZN or FB in my opinion isn't apples to apples.  That said I am definitely retarded so I may absolutely not be looking at this correctly.

The reason why I am not sure you can or should treat this as a tech company is really for one main reason.  At it's core RKT relies on loaning money in an extremely competitive industry.  There rates aren't much, if any lower than the competition.  

FB, Google, and AMZN's algos that they use to drive their business have a huge up front fixed cost but the variable costs are pretty low so for them to continue to grow it doesn't take much more than the initial investment to keep growth going.  RKT at its core has to come up with more capital to be able to make more loans.

I'd like to hear your opinion on why I'm wrong.  If they are working on algos to automate the lending process to further drive down costs etc. I think that would be a huge driver for growth and would set them apart from their industry peers.  I've not heard anything but again, I seriously could have missed it.  

It for sure seems undervalued.  They consistently beat expectations and they announced a $1bn share buy back at their last earnings and then the price went down which blew my mind.  Hope I hear from you.",IllUpvoteEverything,wallstreetbets,20.0

Google MORE Act.  Google Who sponsored MORE Act. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the reality of decriminalization...  It has nothing to do with law enforcement, it's about banking.  

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, all cannabis business is cash or hard money lenders...  Once the MORE Act passes, the cannabis industry gets access to the world credit system.  They get to be like normal businesses and apply for SBA loans etc etc.  They can  get leases without extreme deposits, insurance, regular business banking services. Decriminalizing means access to the worlds financial networks; to date large institutions couldn't touch them because of the federal criminal statute... that'll be gone with the MORE Act. Then GS, BAC, all the big money regulated funds will be able to invest...  That's alot of sideline money that has been waiting to get into a currently all cash market...

&amp;#x200B;

That's a great meal, but what about the sides... on the side?  Well... How about taxes...?  The government just gave away 6 trillion, and shut down all the businesses that PAY for that 6 trillion.  Dems are in charge... they love dope and taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, and the cherry...  Kamala Harris sponsored the bill as a Senator.  With a 50/50 Senate, the VP is the chair of the senate; she can add things to the agenda.

6,2021-03-10,"I‚Äôm thinking of going all in on Roblox tomorrow morning, so I‚Äôm doing my DD as I type this up.

Roblox made $923.9 million of revenue last year 2020 - but reported a loss of $253.3 million....

Paying the Roblox content creators 30% of revenue is $277.17 million (almost what they posted as loss, which is fishy), but leaves $696.73 million of revenue.

So let‚Äôs try to figure out Operating Expenses...

7 executives according to https://corp.roblox.com/people/ - whom are reportedly very well compensated.  But I think the website is out of date, or skimmed on purpose - I‚Äôm a tech infrastructure guy and I know of Dan Williams hired at Roblox in 2017 (moving from Dropbox, before that Facebook) to tackle their infrastructure issues - https://corp.roblox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TechCrunch-Ron-Miller-How-Roblox-Completely-Transformed-its-Tech-Stack.pdf
More on him and the infrastructure later.

So this site says that they are up to 26 executives- https://craft.co/roblox/executives

Ok, let‚Äôs low ball at $3 million a year each exec (unknown bonuses) (https://fintechzoom.com/fintech_news_roblox/heres-how-much-robloxs-executives-and-cofounders-make/ )
minus $78 million = $618.73 million revenue.  

They currently have 960 employees. https://www.barrons.com/articles/roblox-sets-date-to-go-public-through-a-direct-listing-51614036401

953 non exec employees.  Some are in China, some make more than others.  Majority have a Silicon Valley engineering salary, benefits + perks - let‚Äôs estimate and say those 953 employees average a cost of $300k a year.  That‚Äôs another $285.9 million in employee wages, leaves us with $332.83 million left of the revenue for 2020.

$332.83 million *estimated* left in revenue plus the reported $253.3 million reported loss for 2020 is still $586.13 million left to cover.

Data Center + migration costs.  Back to Dan Williams.  His purpose was to reduce the infrastructure costs by moving everything they could off of AWS and Windows servers.  AWS cloud provider costs + running everything on Windows servers with a cost of license per server - is fucking expensive.  My best guess and hope for investing is that this cost is what got rolled up into the $253.3 million reported loss for 2020.  This meant setting up 5+ year contracts with Data Center and POP co-location     providers (point of presence, where the Comcast, Verizon, etc ISPs hand off their internet traffic).  Roblox wouldn‚Äôt have the FB type cash to build their own data centers, so you are talking about $30k a month lease per site.  At least 8x Data Centers in the US with 1-3 POPs per DC. ~24 contracts at $30k a month = $8.64 million a year.  Similar costs in China, maybe - I dunno the network layout there or how things go with dealing with Chinese government, hence the deal with Tencent.

The cost for populating these Data Centers and POPs with hardware, and performing the migration is the upfront expensive part.  Buying the server hardware, buying the network equipment - paying for your own network transit instead of leasing from AWS.  Heavy upfront costs, but much much cheaper in the long run than AWS bills.

But I cannot figure anything that would add up to $586.13 million, even if they were giving blank checks and made subpar deals with vars and vendors where everyone got a very hefty cut to make things happen fast and smooth.  I also don‚Äôt know what existing contracts they might have had to break / pay off to go the route that would be best going forward.

I‚Äôm gonna rough estimate $150 million on infrastructure equipment and another $150 million on contracts and vendor costs.  $586.13 million minus that *very* rough $300 million brings me down to ~$286 million of costs unaccounted for (again, almost their reported loss - still fishy).

And I doubt they have been able to move all of their services off of AWS - which means they still pay AWS bills, and depending on what services those are - they could be hefty bills. 

I do know that if Roblox had planned better from the start - they wouldn‚Äôt even be going public.  Optimized servers and back end code on free Linux distos, even running on a cloud provider - would be profitable with their volume.  Look at Steam...


So, long term:

Roblox has almost 300 open job positions https://corp.roblox.com/careers/ between US and China. They are pushing hard to expand into China through a ownership partnership with Tencent (look them up if you are not into gaming).  They are actively working to right the ship and they have hired high level executives and engineers who have past experience producing results for other Fortune 100 companies.


I spent this time to look into things I was questionable about and still the $253 million loss on ~$1 billion revenue.  I didn‚Äôt fully answer my own questions, but got a reasonable explanation for myself.

I‚Äôm not selling my GME or rest of my folio to go RBLX - but I am going to go in with what I‚Äôve got tomorrow am.  I‚Äôm a high risk, short term profit guy - so that‚Äôs I‚Äôm betting on.  But this could still be the direct listing IPO that tanks after opening.

* GameStop(GME) builds on Monday's 40% surge

* Indexes up: Dow 0.53%, S&amp;P 1.49%, Nasdaq 3.17% (Adds comment, details; updates prices)

By Shashank Nayar and Medha Singh

March 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks advanced on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq jumping over 3% to recoup its losses in the previous session as U.S. bond yields retreated and investors picked up battered technology stocks.

Among the biggest boosts to the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq were Tesla Inc(TSLA), Apple Inc(AAPL), Amazon.com Inc(AMZN), Facebook Inc(FB) and Microsoft Corp(MSFT) jumped between 2.4% and 7.2% after sharp losses in recent weeks as a rise in yields raised concerns over their high valuations.

Signs that a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package was closing in on final approval sparked a spike in yields on Monday, pushing the tech-heavy Nasdaq to end more than 10% below its Feb. 12 closing high that confirmed a correction.

U.S. 10-year Treasury bond yields eased to 1.54% after hovering near 13-month highs of 1.613% in the prior session. Longer-dated yields have jumped over the last month as investors price in a faster-than-expected economic rebound and higher inflation.

Higher yields can weigh even more on tech and growth stocks with lofty valuations, as they threaten to erode the value of their longer-term cash flows.

""Tech stocks are overdue for some kind of bounce after the downfall they have had so far with most investor maintaining a positive outlook (on them) in the medium to longer term,"" said Michael Sheldon, chief investment officer at RDM Financial in Westport, Connecticut.

""Potential headwind for the market is if interest rates rise further from this point over the short period... since they have risen too fast in too little time.""

At 9:59 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 168.01 points, or 0.53%, to 31,970.45, the S&amp;P 500 gained 57.06 points, or 1.49%, to 3,878.41 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 399.55 points, or 3.17%, to 13,008.71.

The rise in yields has accelerated a rotation from ""stay-at-home"" winners to stocks primed to benefit from an economic reopening, helping the blue-chip Dow hit an intraday record high on Monday.

The global economic outlook has brightened as vaccine rollouts gain speed and the United States launches a massive new stimulus package, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said, hiking its 2021 growth forecasts.

The U.S. House of Representatives could approve the relief bill as early as Tuesday, with a vote allowing the Democratic president to sign the legislation into law later this week.

The bank index dropped 2% after vaulting to a new 14-year peak. Financials and energy sectors were in the red.

GameStop (GME) was up 18%, building on Monday's rise of over 40% on the video retailer's e-commerce strategy and speculation that small investors will pour stimulus checks into markets.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 3.2-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&amp;P 500 posted 15 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 131 new highs and eight new lows. (Reporting by Shashank Nayar and Medha Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel)",ionized_fallout,wallstreetbets,22.0

3,2021-03-11,"The largest problem with your model is the gross margin assumption being far off. Palantir is aiming for 85%+ gross margins. They were talking about that on investor day. 

As for the price / sales your assumption is also low. It is not the case that a company growing this fast with this kind of margin gets a 20 PS. You should be thinking more like Shopify (SHOP). Companies that get low PS in software are mature like Google or FB. But they don‚Äôt have that kind of growth. You are showing a measly $7bn revenue which is a paltry portion of their TAM. 

You also should consider for pricing in long term growth the TAM will greatly increase. They are underpricing their product to gain monopoly power. They are seeking a technical monopoly as they are too far ahead, also to discourage new entrants right now with low pricing, and to ward off any anti trust pressure via low pricing.

* Yields lower after 10-year Treasury note auction

* Indexes up: Dow 1.67%, S&amp;P 0.88%, Nasdaq 0.17% (Adds House vote, comments)

By Karen Pierog and Herbert Lash

March 10 (Reuters) - The S&amp;P 500 rose on Wednesday and the blue-chip Dow hit a record high after tepid consumer prices data for February calmed inflation worries and legislators gave final approval to one of the largest economic stimulus measures in U.S. history.

A rotation into sectors such as energy and financials continued, both in small- and large-cap stocks, as investors bet on consumer spending when the U.S. economy reopens and sold the big tech names that have fueled the rally since last March.

Accelerated coronavirus vaccine rollouts and a monster fiscal stimulus on the horizon have raised bets on higher inflation, triggering a spike in Treasury yields that pushed the Nasdaq down as much as 12% from its Feb. 12 record close.

Meanwhile, Wednesday's $38 billion 10-year Treasury note auction, which was met with modest demand, pushed the benchmark yield to a session low of 1.506%.

The ""market seemed nonplussed and Treasuries rallied but that didn't seem to give a boost to tech (stocks),"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.

Rising yields had weighed on technology shares that rely on cheap funding for growth.

The U.S. Labor Department released data that indicated the core consumer prices index, which excludes volatile items such as food and energy, rose less than expected last month.

Investors are shifting funds from tech stocks with lofty valuations to other groups, such as energy and financials, that are undervalued and more of a play on an improving economy in a post-COVID world than big tech is, said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.

""It is occurring in fits and starts,"" Tuz said. ""That is essentially the overwhelming theme in the market right now and it probably will continue until these things run their course.""

The move away from Apple Inc(AAPL), Amazon.com Inc(AMZN) , Facebook(FB), Tesla and Microsoft Corp , all down on the day, included a rotation into small-cap stocks, which rose 2.0%, or double the gains of the S&amp;P 500.

Also helping lift stocks are analysts who have raised their estimates for U.S. corporate profitability this year following surprisingly strong fourth-quarter earnings and growing optimism about an economic rebound.

By 2:41 p.m. ET (1941 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 531.85 points, or 1.67%, to 32,364.59, the S&amp;P 500 gained 33.96 points, or 0.88%, to 3,909.4 and the Nasdaq Composite added 22.29 points, or 0.17%, to 13,096.11.

The Nasdaq extended gains in choppy trade after logging its best one-day percentage jump in four months on Tuesday.

The sweeping $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives gave President Joe Biden his first major victory in office.

Some of the $1,400 in payments heading to most Americans could end up in the stock market and could provide a boost for GameStop(GME) and other stocks popular among retail investors active in online social media forums.

Trading in GameStop(GME) was volatile with the stock at times poised to set the videogame retailer on track for its longest streak of daily gains in six months and extending a rally that has already doubled the company's market value.

Among other ""meme"" stocks, Koss Corp(KOSS) climbed 49%.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.86-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.67-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&amp;P 500 posted 47 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 283 new highs and 19 new lows.

How is this ANY different than short-term dips and volatility based on something coming out on the daily news or newspaper? What does it matter if you read ""gamestop heavily shorted, prime for a squeeze"" in the WSJ versus some random person on reddit, twitter, fb, instagram,etc? Literally the only difference is who pays attention. They act like discussing stocks is some new thing on the internet. The only thing different is the market is more accessible and easier to use for us retailers. Also, the availability of quality information is much better than it was 10 years ago, so not only is it more accessible, we are getting better data to make more informed decisions. 

Who cares if I base my stock picks on social media, the WSJ, some random stock pick website, astrology, or what miss cleo says? These have been around FOREVER. The only difference right now is retailers caught on to something, and other whales took notice. This is bigger than just wallstreetbets, there are some other whales and retailers in it.

But a few years back my wife and I were kind of living in the duldrums so to speak. We weren't making enough to save for a house yet, we hadn't been in a vacation in years and we hated our jobs. She would sit in fb and pine for what other people were doing and was like ""it pisses me off that other people don't work as hard as we do and yet can do all this stuff""

And I agreed but I told her we're only seeing the best of these people's lives and that this isn't a good way to look at things, comparing yourself to them when our situations are different. 

Eventually we moved on in life and are a lot happier now with where we are and she doesn't do that anymore.

Great DD !!

On **IVY** \- absolutely, as you point out, barely anyone is paying serious attention in particular discounting into the valuation. It's pretty obvious IVY will work and more question of what degree. John Wall spoke at CITI and JPM Conferences in January and on April 1st on a conference call entitled *'How U.S. and Chineses corporations collaborate in growing autonomous vehicles*'. Here are some choice quotes (or paraphrases) he made during these:

* *'The response from automanufacturers has been ""overwhelming""'.*
* *'These are sitting on a ""goldmine of data"" '.*
* *""We are seeing that the use cases are unending"".*
* *""Your imagination is the limit"".*

John Wall is not a spinmaster and seems low key. He also underlined there's been lots of dialogue / exchanges with these (so he's not dreaming). 

On **Valuation** \- Yes there are quite a few known names that are used as comparables and many are valued at 10x BB even though they have similar or less revenue. The most often cited is solid but not ten times as solid and longer term not nearly as interesting, nor with potential of BB. Here is one interesting metric we can thank Bill Gates for. Almost to the day 10 years ago FB had a user base of 50 million and NO revenues. The average FB user, it seems, spends about 35 minutes per day on FB. For a 1.6% stake Bill Gates's MS invested $240 million into FB valuing FB at $15 billion (3 times the value of BB today). This also valued FB at $300 per user. QNX has a user base of over 175 million and growing at about 25 million per year. The average driver is in their car 90 mintes per day. If we ignored all of BB's current business or their potential, and looked only at IVY, BB is valued at close to $25 per user. John Wall previously calrified that IVY will work on the existing installed base of QNX. So much potential yet one does not pay for it at these levels.

Licensing revenue wasn‚Äôt zero this quarter.  
Far from it.  It was merely down.

Chen said we could assume that the deal will be replaced by $100M in annual revenue.

As a result, using a discount rate of 10%, HRs saying that the all in deal is worth around $1B.

If day half is up front and half is along the 7 year tail, it could be something like $650M up front and upto $100M annually for 7 years thereafter.  (Ballpark, discounted over 7 yrs)

This is still an amazing chunk of change, obviously, and will help them fuel marketing and IVY initiatives which are the REAL investment here.  

Also, as with any parent portfolio, most patents are trash / worthless.  Max 10% have any value and 10-50 (in messaging, networking, etc) that are super valuable in that they are worth defending through litigious processes.  

All in all, GREAT post, rival.  
$BB will a late 2021 story as it‚Äôs core businesses (cybersecurity / IVY develop), but this patent sale will be the one large catalyst between now and then.

All those things are quite normal nowadays.

 For all application development there is not only competition for customers but also competition for developers. If majority of developers learn your platform then regardless of where they work to create applications they will promote your platform as the tool to make the applications. Being developer friendly is what made AWS the leader in its space and this could happen for unity too although unreal engine (owned by epic) is also a leader in this space. They could both continue to share the market but I anticipate lots of competition between the two and even by Apple or FB if they choose to make their own development platforms for ar/vr.

With that in mind Etsy formed a partnership with them but what they offer isn‚Äôt something that can‚Äôt be replicated, so I agree with you that it‚Äôs not anything all that unique but because it is directly related to niche market items and hobby supplies making it more useful for advertisers. The big thing though is the monetization of each user on Fb is $7 whereas it is .70 cents on Pinterest. Pinterest hasn‚Äôt hit a lot of major markets yet in South America and across the globe but right now I think Brazil is their big campaign. All that being said, they should‚Äôve sold for 50b but if they didn‚Äôt, wtf do they know that we don‚Äôt cause that is the highest priced acquisition I can think of recent history.

I advertise on FB for a variety of clients, so that's my perspective and my bias here. The accounts that target broad audiences (like all men, or all women, or everyone age 25-45 etc) are doing better than before the iOS roll out. The accounts that are super specific (not real to protect my identity, but for instance: only people with a passion for llama farming, only business owners who are losing their hair or only foodies in the greater Austin area) are struggling. 

One other consideration is that FB can just charge more for their inventory (and they absolutely have been...CPM's are up for us roughly 30-50% vs pre-pandemic).

Lastly, I saw some comments mention cAPI, but that doesn't work for opted out iOS users...which again is a drag for smaller advertisers but doesn't matter for bigger advertisers.",idk_justbenice,wallstreetbets,12.0

31,2021-05-09,"Great question. Many responses so far are fairly generic, so I‚Äôll give you an illustrative example.

Years ago, I bought $1K of my very first stock. At the time, I had six figures of debt and a salary around $50K, but my basic needs were met and I was fairly confident in my upcoming career. Most of my income went to living and paying down debt, so the stock was the ‚Äúrisky‚Äù portion. It was a tip from a friend‚Äôs father who knew the business well. $1K was a lot of money for me at the time. If I lost it all, it would sting but I would recover. (The stock traded sideways for a couple of years, then cut in half. I finally sold it at a 50% loss this past January. It still stung, but mostly pride.)

A couple of years later, I was down to $80K of debt, my salary was just north of $100K, and the career prospects still looked optimistic. Most of my income still went to living and paying down debt. I had self-imposed forced savings, setting aside a portion each month. In those years I took a small number of larger bets, investing $5K to $10K in three or four stocks total. Still no ETFs. Again, this was the ‚Äúrisky‚Äù portion that would sting if I lost it all, but I could afford to lose it. (Those stocks all did well, including buying FB around $46 and selling it around $60, and buying TSLA around $235 and selling around $360, pre-split. I made money on stocks, around a 50% return, aren‚Äôt I such a brilliant investor? /s)

Not long after that, the first Brexit vote happened and the markets took a short but steep drop. I loaded up about $20K each on two dividend-paying ETFs. Large bets, for me, but a ‚Äúsafer‚Äù play because the investments were somewhat diversified. (I made a very small amount from the dividends but the ETFs did well, and I sold them this past January for a 30% and a 70% gain.)

Another couple of years later, the debt was down to about $40K, my salary was north of $150K, and my portfolio had evolved into about a dozen investments: a few ETFs and the rest in stocks. My bets grew larger, investing $10K to $20K in any one stock. I now set aside around $2K per month as forced savings. I would use those funds to buy stock whenever I saw a ‚Äúvalue‚Äù opportunity (think: VW stock dropping after its emissions scandal, BA stock dropping after its safety scandal).

Fast-forward another couple of years, to March 2020. My salary is now north of $200K (plus some nice bonuses) and my debt is down to about $20K, but I have not invested for awhile. The markets were at high points so nothing looked like a ‚Äúvalue‚Äù investment. Instead, it looked like I could lose a lot if the market ‚Äúcorrected‚Äù. So when COVID hit, I had around $200K of cash waiting to invest. I slammed about half of that into a half-dozen ETFs, around $18K each. (I got in too early as the market was still dropping, so those promptly dropped in half. It was nearly a year before I would sell them for very modest gains.) I took out a bank loan specifically to invest in stocks. I then invested that and the rest of my set-aside into stocks over the next month, around $30-50K per stock. Most were longer term COVID recovery bets: airlines, cruise lines, hotels, EB, etc. Still not really a YOLO, but I was now making larger bets and borrowing to invest, and it was long past the days where $1K was a significant percentage of my net worth.

In mid-January 2021, I decided to rebalance my investments, selling off any moderately-performing ETFs and stocks. I took heavier bets into stocks that still had room to recover during COVID, including a small movie theater chain called AMC. Around that time, I noticed but paid no attention to WSB posts that somehow made it onto the front page of reddit, something about a ‚ÄúGME‚Äù that sounded over-hyped and risky. I bought $100K of AMC at around $4.50, my largest single stock buy ever, and woke up two days later to find that investment worth $300K. As a result, and like millions of other people that week, I started reading WSB. (I held AMC through the January peak, bought more at $6 and $9, and eventually sold around $10 per share.)

In March 2021, I did my first real YOLO. It was influenced in part by approaches of WSB personalities like /u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT: put everything into one stock, but one that has a large market cap and so while it may dip it will not wipe you out. When GME dipped again, I sold every other stock I owned, even the well-performing ones, and bought around $900K of GME for $140 per share. Aside from a $20K emergency fund and a $20K bet on ABNB 2022 calls, that is all the money I have. BUT - and this is important - I can still withstand the shock if that bottoms out. I currently expect to make north of $350K from non-investment income this year, and expect the same per year for the foreseeable future. So even if GME gets completely wiped out, it will hurt (a lot) but it will not destroy my life and I will live to see another day. If GME dips a lot, I can afford to hold for a long time while it recovers.

tl;dr - my stock bets started small but eventually grew over time into a true YOLO, but even with the true YOLO I can afford to lose it all. Always keep a good emergency fund and only bet what you can afford to lose.",veritable__quandary,wallstreetbets,31.0

It might affect the stock price, but you'll see a reversal when FB posts earnings and they're unaffected by the change in the short term.

As far as the long term, it's hard to say. It might make other advertising venues more profitable, but it still won't be as targeted. As you said the iOS audience is highly coveted.

2. People start to realize that Google Search is fucking shit now (see all the memes recently) and only recommends the safest/most corporate results possible and doesn't actually help people anymore. Folks start moving to duckduckgo etc. (this could also be related to #1)

These factors weren't in MS's or BB's control, although both companies did open up programs and events in order to draw in developers which eventually failed.

My fear is too many people are buying into too many stocks causing small blips where if, like in the beginning with GME, everyone fixated on 2 stock, or maybe 2, all the funding would cause another spike like we saw. People say ""it costs too much now""... well, im sure plenty of people said the same for GME at 50... I know I did. Then I saw the spike and realized 50 a share would have me banking right now. You drop in $50 x1000 and it goes to 100.. is that much different than the guy who dropped 10 and now has 20? Actually, the guy dropping 50 will profit way more for smaller increases. So... its never too late unless you're an idiot using the light bill money on trades.... about like the fucktards in line at the gas station buying a 22 oz beer buying 200 in lottery tickets, wearing rags and smelling like shitty cat litter...saying ""this is the ticket"" . If you cant lose the money and be okay, dont use it... pay your bills, whats left your willing to roll, roll it. Its a new pair of shitty shoes or 50 on a share that could easily make you 3-4x that.. and then you have a new pair of shoes and more money to roll.. and repeat. PEOPLE NEED TO FOCUS ON 1 OR 2 THAT EVERYONE IS IN ON. STOP PUTTING 5 IN 5 STOCKS, PUT 25 IN ONE AND THERE IS WHERE THE GIFT COMES IN

AMC is ranging from $1 to $16 ($16 being insane, imo).

The above are the meme stonks that had the highest options volume on June 9. Most had calls trading to puts roughly at 8 to 2, on average; except for CLOV and AMC because those two are switching to puts pretty quickly (currently ~6 to 4 from 8 to 2 just a few days ago, which is not a good sign and almost always leads to drop in share price, as far as meme stocks are concerned). RIDE is also an exception, 5 to 5 as far as calls and puts trading goes.

Don‚Äôt forget the mother of all! It didn‚Äôt make the most active options list today though. 

GME (pretty generous, imo):

2,2021-06-12,"I recommend you do your own research and convince yourself if you want to buy BB or not. They recently had a tech conference, and the transcript is available, where they talked about their latest products. Here's what I took away:

1) They are in the forefront of AI driven approach for cyber security solutions. Their code was effective against the recent colonial pipeline cyber attack and their systems are widely used by the US govt.

2) Their partnership with Amazon for Ivy, and qnx, their other offering in the EV OS platform. Some 175mil cars already use this.

3) Patents/ litigation settlement with FB.

I'm actually thankful for the meme stocks for bringing my attention to BB. Sure I'm using the ongoing volatility for some quick profits, but I'm going long on this.

This is the easier, less stressful, and more profitable way to make money than trying to flip every day. You‚Äôre more likely to stick with your price target and execute because you actually believe in the company.

BB is a $50 stock by 2023/2024. But I 100% guarantee we will have multiple meme moments/crazy spike in between. So buy when people stop believing and hold till everyone starts FOMOing and sell on the spike. Buy back in after a new floor is established.

I do believe we will try to hit 20 again in the next few months tho just based on TA (maybe even a run up into earnings) BB Might retrace to high 12s but I don‚Äôt expect it to go sub 10 again. Unless earnings is complete dog which it very well could be. The next big catalyst is going to be the patent sale (probably FB) and when huawei patents will be reflected in earnings. Once these things are shown in earnings there will easily a spike to 20 and above again.

If you head over to thetagang, hundreds of people selling CCs when amc was in the $11-14 range got all their stock assigned and didn't make any profit past amc going over $14+. We need to avoid this at all costs.

As for other stocks i plan on wheeling a few tickers such as amd, msft, fb and dkng after amc is done with.

Pubmatic is decently well diversified and they've been working on their relationships with agencies/advertisers for some time now. They also have a good cash pile that they can use to make a strategic M&amp;A, which could help them further diversify. 

Right now their revenue is accelerating and their margins are expanding. It'll be important to watch this trend to make sure it doesn't reverse.

4,2021-07-09,"Yes.  Since the beginning of the year.  GME had an incredible run.  But the fact that it has not performed well recently indicates that there is not some incredible gain to be had from now.  The stock is no longer as heavily shorted and if you were a new investor, why would you buy in at $200+ when you can buy another stock for $10 and watch it run up?  This isn‚Äôt a competition.  The stocks aren‚Äôt related.  By all means keep your GME if you believe it‚Äôs going to skyrocket further.  But it might be smart to invest in other opportunities because others might hit too.  Now if you want to know why I specifically believe in the $CLOV opportunity, I started on WSB on FB but they are all AMC.  If you talk about anything other than AMC they freak out‚Ä¶so I was referred here.  And while there are are a bunch of ideas circulating, I noticed that most don‚Äôt have their own sub, and if they do it‚Äôs like a couple thousand people (nowhere near the six figures of AMC and GME).  But I watched as Clov‚Äôs sub rapidly grew to almost 40K in 3 weeks, despite all the hate thrown its way.  So it is building a loyal following, which is obviously key.

He is very intelligent in that he threw out stats like 50% of the companies fake their numbers and Chinese govt cares only if more than 30% is fake to make his story credible. 

And from a practical standpoint, it's basically impossible to prove him wrong. No one is ever going to examine the books of 400 listed companies and decide if 50% of them fake up to 30% or more. 

So, I can make this exact same speech about any country in the world and it would be perfectly fine and no one can sue me for slander.  

But, where's the evidence for any of this?  He is literally pulling numbers from his ass and you're somehow listing him as evidence?!?  What kind of joke is this?

18,2021-08-01,"Because it feels bad to see your market holdings make you thousands of dollars, then look at the $30 you got from your bonds and your $0.23 you got from your cash.

Holding cash absolutely helps protect you from a pullback and also gives you the ability to buy in the dip for future earnings potential.  It also makes you miss out on current gains.  So when current gains have been amazing for most of the last 13 years, it's hard for people to justify missing out on that to hold cash for some theoretical future event.

Sure, it seems ""obvious"" that some big correction is coming up.  But that's been ""obvious"" for years now, and anyone who's been sitting out waiting for that has missed out on a ton.  I read an article in 2018 that cited the old story about JFK Sr. and the shoeshine boy and talked about why it was time to pull out of the FANG stocks.  All of those stocks are worth roughly triple what they were in 2018 (except FB which ""only"" doubled since then).  

That's why people are parking almost all of their money in the market.  Yes, they'll be hit hard by a big crash.  But a lot of more conservative/cautious/bearish investors have missed out on a whole lot of money if this is the attitude they've had for the last decade.",sirisaacnuton,wallstreetbets,18.0

Once we have our money, there are no PayPal or bank chargebacks from scammy buyers running rampant in EBay and FB marketplace.

Mercari uses the same payment system as Posh, but they are way more likely to default side with a buyer in a dispute than Posh is. To this end, I now sell stuff for cash on FB and on Poshmark. I pulled all listings from EBay when they changed a bunch of policies during covid that rolled out the red carpet for fraud. Joy.

Not a reason not to buy the stock, just clarifying sellers on the site aren't the moron cheerleaders you make us out to be. We just don't like the risk exposure of EBay and FB. 

Also Posh Ambassadors don't get paid because we don't do anything.

If you are trying to gamble your positions are awful because you're basically playing roulette and betting on green when the payout is 0.2 to 1 if it hits. If you literally pick all WSB stock picks you are actually a retard chasing after the train after it's already left the station, or going to your local palm reader for financial advise.

My suggestion, throw a decent portion of your portfolio (25%-50%) at FAANG (FB, AAPL, AMZN, NFLX, GOOG) or similar stable high growth stocks in long-term (5 to 35 year holdings) long positions and you can play with the rest IF you are legit trying to invest. If you're trying to gamble use options so at least you can feel like you're in Vegas and lose just as much money twice as fast, my suggestion is starting with ITM call spreads for bullish and ITM put spreads for bearish until you get a feel for market trends, press releases, earnings reports, etc. I would almost always suggest to NEVER do OTM weeklies unless you know damn well what you're doing since that is normally just throwing money at the wind. But if you want to be a true WSB autist this is the way, everyone goes through that phase and some of us never leave and just eat -100% every friday.

ie if you had 3 data points, 2 from facebook spring 2020 hires, 1 from pinterest, and they all entered on levels a few months after joining, it would be drastically different than if it were 2 facebook fall 2020 hires

at low levels you can make marginally more money hopping companies each year and getting lucky with well-timed grants but like.. i mean if youre really about TC you should be wanting to be senior+1 or senior+2

i think everyone agrees that its not reliable to do that at other companies (a staff at linkedin will get downleveld AF if they move to facebook etc) but if you goto those levels at FAANG all other companies will value it or even give you a level boost to move

2,2021-09-02,"Sell way OTM CCs on stocks you already own, so like 30 delta at most but 15 delta is safer and probably free money.  PMCC underlying should be the same criteria as if you wanted to just be long on the stock itself but the long call is cheaper than the stock so you can play on shit you couldn't afford to just buy 100 shares like AMZN, TSLA, etc.  

&amp;#x200B;

If you want a better strategy than the wheel, what I do is size my position in 200-share minimum size and then buy-write 100 shares with a CC and then a CSP for the other 100 shares, so basically a covered strangle.  Profits from both sides of the wheel, is as directional as you want it to be (but generally directional with positive delta), and captures profits from gains in the underlying instead of fucking right off with those like if you're just selling a CSP with the wheel.  If you get assigned on your CSP, then switch to just CCs.  If you get assigned on your CCs then either go back in or switch to another underlying.  I might get assigned on MARA if it keeps going up, but if so then I'll get assigned at 43 where my entry was 30 and my adjusted basis is probably closer to 25 so that's not bad for 6 weeks or so on a single position in a $10k account (actual account is closer to $35k but I'm pretending it's only $10k so I can practice this shit without blowing up my account).  This strategy ONLY works because we're in the longest bull market in history, but because of that I want to be more directional.  If we get into a crash, then chase your underlying down with CCs and roll to 50 delta every time your CCs hit like 80 delta to lock in the intrinsic in the contract for a small additional profit.  Also sell call credit spreads as it falls and buy back in at the bottom with all the premium you made during the fall.  On the way up, put credit spreads and CSPs will make you more money.  If it stays at the bottom, then condor the fuck out of it and set a limit buy like $1 below your short call so you can turn that shit into a covered call and a long call; if it drops then just take assignment on the short put if you like the stock.  


For PMCC, the good part is you can use it on stocks you can't afford so NVDA, AMD, TSLA, AAPL, MSFT (premium is shit though), FB, etc.  It's also a much more efficient use of capital than an actual CC with the stock in terms of your ROC since you can hold more positions (so trade more positions but trade smaller; read up on the Kelly Criterion for gamblers to figure out position sizing).  With 10k I'd recommend 3 positions with a maximum of maybe 4 or 5 positions at most.  With any options selling strategy, your goal is to get rich very slowly but consistently.

17,2021-09-02," Shares of Forte Biosciences Inc. are trading lower in Thursday's after-hours market, following the announcement it won't continue to advance its FB-401 for treatment of atopic dermatitis.

The company said a ""Phase 2 clinical trial of FB-401 for the treatment of atopic dermatitis failed to meet statistical significance for the primary endpoint.""

Forte Biosciences said it observed positive trends in key secondary endpoints.

""The topline data is disappointing and we will continue to analyze the data; however, given this readout we will not continue to advance FB-401,"" said Paul Wagner, chief executive. ""We expect to provide investors with an update on the future plans for the company over the next several months,"" he added.

15,2021-09-09,"Reposting here: you‚Äôre missing the point of his bet.

People don't see the full idea behind Michael Burry's TSLA short. Every single article is about how he tweeted at papa Musk and how he thinks that the company is the worst thing since he dropped his glass eye into his cat's litter box.

He doesn't think that Tesla will implode. He doesn't think it's a failing company. He just sees the reality, which is that all of their profits/revenues are way in the future.

Let's just say you win a time-delayed lottery and get $1,000,000 in 15 years. Not bad! Now let's say you won the same lottery in Venezuela in 2005. It's not even worth cashing the ticket.

It's the same deal with companies. Growth companies, however promising, have most of their expected profits in the future. Those profits have to be discounted by the **interest rate** to be turned into todays dollars. In other words, it doesn't matter how much money Tesla is going to make in the future if interest rates surge today. Well... it does matter... it's just worth a lot less.

So how does this relate to the Burry bet? You just have to scroll down a few lines on his 13F filing.

Burry has almost as many GOOG/FB calls as he does TSLA puts. Around \~$330MM of them. Why does this matter? These are big tech companies that are actually printing out metric shit-tons of profit today.

Interest rates stay the same but big tech goes up? Break even. Big tech goes down? Break even. Interest rates rise? Burry makes more money in a year than all of your wives boyfriends combined.

TL;DR:

The Burry TSLA short isn't a bet against Tesla, it's a bet on interest rates rising (AKA inflation).",augusttrip2019,wallstreetbets,15.0

Burry has almost as many GOOG/FB calls as he does TSLA puts. Around \~$330MM of them. Why does this matter? These are big tech companies that are actually printing out metric shit-tons of profit today.

Interest rates stay the same but big tech goes up? Break even. Big tech goes down? Break even. Interest rates rise? Burry makes more money in a year than all of your wives boyfriends combined.

TL;DR:

The Burry TSLA short isn't a bet against Tesla, it's a bet on interest rates rising (AKA inflation).",augusttrip2019,wallstreetbets,16.0

423,2021-10-04,"Just feels like we need to see a much bigger pullback for things to seem like they're priced reasonably, but who knows whether that will happen.

Our last major pullback was of course 12 months ago... at SPY 355-360.

We just topped around SPY 450-455 a month ago.  Just an unreal 25+% run over the past 12 months.

I'd feel really good about buying if we dip into the sub-400 range, but it'll probably require us to see an actual debt default in 2-3 weeks to reach that level (who knows whether that will happen, those types of ""debt ceiling"" events have always been overhyped, but maybe not this time).

More importantly than that, a lot of high growth stocks have been consolidating all year and if that happens to big tech for an extended period of time, we could see a bigger 6-12 month sideways range (like we saw from mid-2015 to mid-2016 during that taper tantrum/interest rate hike/debt ceiling episode where S&amp;P 500 didn't have a new high for almost a year).  Probably worth at least considering how we should trade if that comes to pass.

How would you trade if MSFT/AAPL/GOOG/FB/AMZN are basically range bound for 12 months and then maybe only banks and some re-opening plays and smaller value caps are moving up.

It's worth at least planning for a ""sideways"" year like that as markets absorb tapering + interest rate hike expectations to come.  Going back and looking at stocks in 2015-2016 and how they traded is a worthwhile idea.",zg44,wallstreetbets,423.0

As long as it's left up to FB and other social media to regulate themselves, they will keep regulating in a way that enhances their short-term profits, but which will ultimately destroy their reputation with consumers.

Before buying FB I'm looking for a system of intentional laws to be implemented, kind of like speeding tickets, where people are fined for breaking the laws of the internet. Minor crimes like cyberbullying, revenge porn, showing dead bodies to their relatives, etc, that have a detrimental effect on people's mental health. That kind of thing. 

And before you all jump up and down and start throwing poo, talking about 'how are you going to catch people to fine them in this world of hidden identities,' you just make a law that you can't join FB and post without depositing $50 first, in case you have to pay a fine. And then ban any company that doesn't comply.

Once the enormous amount of minor cyber crimes are removed from the Keyboard warrior's arsenal, spotting the real hardcore crimes will be much easier, as there's way less horrible stuff to weed through. Only then do I think FB has a viable business model.",eddie7000,wallstreetbets,257.0

Not a fan of FB (or user) but I think this is most undervalued big tech, right there with $BABA, and market has a good reason why it's pricing that way.

I think they will fix the issues, regulation will happen in coming years but I think this is a $600 stock in couple of years even at low end of historical P/E multiple. If they navigated through Cambridge Analytica( look at 2019 stock perf), they will navigate through this attention craving Whistleblower's non-revelations.

That said I am considering this play here: Sep 22 250C/330C spreads. It might go lower in coming months/ER(conservative guidance), I plan to buy back sold calls for a profit and let long ride till expiry. That way I can play both sides.",AsymmetricInvestor,wallstreetbets,13.0

Both of them had their low for the year in Q2, so it depends a lot on the exact moment he bought the puts.

He also had 941 000 calls on FB in Q2, which is a position that he likely exited already (for a nice profit probably) since he now has ""#BoycottFacebook"" in his Twitter bio

Like if you want to hold because you think it‚Äôs so solid, eat the fees, sell then re buy. Your conviction will undoubtedly waiver and you‚Äôll not buy back, thus saving yourself from steeper losses. 


I did all of mine in first hour. What time did you?


I am finding continued success buying in the morning. Almost always calls. 


Bought 439 C exp Oct 13 for 2.11-2.13, sold for 2.75-2.85. About 35%, used about 100k here. 

I bought 440 C exp Oct 11 for .66 and .68, sold at .81 for 20%. Only used about 10k here. 

Bought these again shortly after at .72 and sold at .91 for 26%. Used 10k. 

I bought 436 P exp today for .50-.55 and sold .69 area. I only used about 10k here again for 30% or so. 


Why only use 10k? Nervous after big morning win. I didn‚Äôt want to buy. It looked good. But it was mostly a gambling itch. After the second win I was just testing the spy gods. 

Very good day after last weeks rough loss. 

Also sold TSLA held over weekend for a $4-5. Gain per share over 130 shares. Bought FB later in the day. 


Very close to buy puts again later in the day but IBKR doesn‚Äôt like me buying ops that expire in hours and I‚Äôve been burned not being able to buy the dip so I don‚Äôt want to do that and the movement of later this week puts wasn‚Äôt enough to justify the risk. Oh well. 

Made some money on CLOV calls just day trading the 8.5‚Äôs at .20 up to .25 ish. Not many though. Some other minor movements. Ended the day up about 60k with bulk of that attributable to SPY. 


Had some good wins after big loss last week but not full recovery until now. Almost over 300k now after starting with 10k, 12k cad 10k usd I think it was in end of august with intent to trade spy calls primarily. I added 20k more though to sell some puts. 


So if I‚Äôm close to 300k with 30k ish in, 270 up. Sept was better because ended that up 2000% as the original 10 to 200. Now the % gains will look less extreme as I get too nervous. 


It does suck though when you see that you could‚Äôve bet your main pot of 200 and gotten 2-3x more. I had some soy positions option simultaneously though which is why I stopped doing all in on calls so I could jump into other directions or strikes if needed.

So yes their apps are ""replaceable"" but to maintain a running social network with this much bandwidth you have to either build the same infrastructure they have (and this is not easily done), or use their services.

This is of course skipping the many research branches companies like them have (do you know how many AI libraries / algorithm Facebook have developed over the past few years ? A lot).

128,2021-11-04,"While your conservative estimates of the future are as reasonable as any other estimate.  You have to take into account how the market values companies in order to actually predict how stock prices move; which is all we really care about.  'Accurate valuations' aren't actually the end goal, we just assume they are accurate if they predict stock prices well.  We can go back and forth about how the future will play out, and ultimately land on subjective probabilities of each event, but it misses what's important.  

I've been modeling hundreds of companies as potential investments for my job, and here's a little bit of insight I've come across.  Utilizing a 3-statement DCF with some expertise can get you consistently close to current stock prices across most companies, this I'm sure of.  And because of this I can reverse engineer what estimates are implied in stocks as they go through industry, market, and maturity cycles.  Without getting into all the details, it was clear TSLA was undervalued for a long time relative to other fast growing companies.  Mix that with solid fundamentals and management team, and you get a home run.  That's why you have heard certain fund managers talk about how much they love TSLA for years now; it's because we spend the time to study valuation patterns, which the average peasant can't see, or don't have the tools to figure out.  

Here's another freebie, FB is massively undervalued for the same reasons TSLA was undervalued.  Utilize the bad press and the peasants who care about it to your advantage; greater men rule from the shadows &gt;;)",DoobsNDeeps,wallstreetbets,128.0

7. Intel is no longer the more power efficient of the two with the recently released latest generation.  They had to dump all the power they could into the CPU to be able to compete with current-gen AMD.  AMD is about to release next gen in 3 months with general expectation to crush Intel's latest gen for the desktop market.  

leading to point 8...

8. AMD's Epyc server has ran away from Intel as competition -- it's no longer even close.  AMD just announced yesterday their next gen Epyc is expected to have \~50% uplift (in *common* workloads, so VM heavy crap); and the following gen to double their core count to 128 cores. Intel's best is a 38 core CPU which cost more and substantially less powerful then current/last gen AMD Epycs.  FB is utilizing AMD chips, Msoft is rolling out VM infra using AMD chips, I've been rolling my own shops servers over to Epycs. 

&amp;#x200B;

The scariest part to your thesis is if AMD continues to make inroads into the AI segment; if they pull off the ai inference chips right that they been working on, big bucks.

48,2021-11-11,"I think their is truth to your sentiment. Inflation, supply chain disruptions, oil politics, and climate change are all going to take a toll on economics. The markets are a reflection of the general economic situation. 

That said, here is my analysis. Not financial advice. 

Inflation will continue to run higher. The M2 money supply has increased from \~ $15T to \~ $21T from the start of the pandemic [\[source\]](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/money-supply-m2) . That is a 40% increase in money supply. This is the main driver for inflation. To date, we have just seen a fraction of the impact of this increased money supply.

When inflation rises, currency is devalued. Holding cash means you are losing money. So, people rush to invest. The investment options are stocks, bonds, and commodities. 

The rise of stock prices, is a direct result of the increased money supply. But to justify the rise in prices we should see a rise in earnings. So far the EPS for the SP500 seem to have caught up with the rising prices. Pre-pandemic, EPS was at $35.5 which grew to $48.4 [\[source\]](https://ycharts.com/indicators/sp_500_eps). This justifies a price increase for the SP500 to 4700 - 4800, without drastically altering the P/E multiple. Here, there are two crucial assumptions, 1- the stock market works in a vacuum which it doesn't, 2- the earnings will not slow down.

Since the stocks don't work in a vacuum, then we need to look at other investment options. The safest of all, Bonds. The 10Y bond currently yields 1.5%. That is 3.5% short of core inflation. In other words, bonds lose money. But looking at the charts, the bond yield has been rising and we may see a breakout to 2.5% or 3%. This will be determined by the Fed interest rate. If bond yields rise, some money will leave the stock market and take shelter in the safety of the bonds. Bonds are the safest investment there is. This will see a correction in the stock market. 

But what if, earnings fall AND bond prices do not rise. Then we have a bunch of new cash in the market causing inflation and no return on investment on either stocks or bonds, then commodities rise. This means that industrial metals, energy, agricultural products all increase in pricing. We have seen this happen at the beginning of the pandemic when monetary policy was easy yet stocks earnings dropped. If you have spare cash then you better have it in gold or precious metals. Those are assets that have little to no utility but they will simply hedge against inflation. 

I think, we will see a mix of scenarios. Bond prices will rise but not enough to have any meaningful return compared to inflation. The actual inflation is higher than reported by the Fed. This will reflect in the form of rising commodity prices. The stock market will likely see a 10-15% correction at some point but nothing major unless something fundamentally changes with earnings. Still i would want to be invested in companies that are not deemed to overvalued or companies that are unprofitable. Yesterday, i decided to allocate 5% into a gold mining company ($SBSW) and over the past months i have allocated my investments into companies that are strong cash generators or pay dividends (eg. $AAPL, $WMT, $FB, $ATVI). Other investments that i am not so sure about or holding the bag include $BABA, $BA, $SPCE.",mzak88,wallstreetbets,48.0

Instead it starts with some dude crying about how FB won't let you *really* own them (although it does admit later on that you don't really have the right to fully control nft's as a consumer anyway üôÑ). Then it goes on to quote the most insane people I've ever heard. The things these people said literally had me feeling contempt. I'd think they were completely insane if not for the greed factor here. Below is just one excerpt from the article.

*For fellow metaverse pioneer Benoit Pagotto, co-founder of virtual sneaker company RTFKT, digital ownership makes room to change the roles of brands and consumers.

""It's a huge shift in (the way) the relationship between business, creativity and consumerism is working,"" he said at the Reuters Next conference. ""A product is not a one-off thing. You need to think of how you can continue to update it,"" he said.

""It's very, very much more fluid. I think the real world will soon be overwhelmed by that because the possibilities of interaction in a digital world are so much deeper.""*",[deleted],wallstreetbets,124.0

I started out with 40k savings, and bought almost all AAPL/MSFT/QQQ shares in 2016 and held until now. A lot of those stocks have gotten 400%+ gains over the 5 years. Then every paycheck I got throughout the years, I kept putting money into stocks into a mixed ratio of safe stocks vs high-risk stocks. I would always make sure that I was allocating most of my portfolio into safe stocks, and a small portion into riskier option plays. I would never risk more than 5-10% of my portfolio on option plays / earnings plays / meme stocks / what have you. I made some big mistakes on options, and made some gains on options. In the end I think I only profited a little bit, and I still have a ways to go when it comes to learning how to be a better options trader. However, my ""long term"" stocks have mostly always gone up, and by safe I mean I was periodically buying AMD, TSLA, NVDA, HD, FB through the years on top of the FAANG that I already had and \*never\* selling. I misspoke when I said I turned 40K into 400K. It was more like I started with 40K, and kept adding money in (from my paychecks) and buying brand-name stocks until my portfolio rose to 400K. In the end I think out of the 400K total amount, almost 100k of it was my own capital from the money I saved from my paychecks from 2016-now (which includes the 40K I started with). The rest were gains. I know this goes against the entire WSB mantra of YOLO-ing everything but at the end of the day, long term stocks are rewarding with patience. The YOLO part is all fun but \*extremely\* high risk and may not be the best idea if you can't handle big losses. Hope that makes sense",AshamedEstate1974,wallstreetbets,0.0
1,2021-12-08,"Counter point:

All of this assumes that there will be a functioning company. A few things that I would note:



1) The recent PIPE deal is extremely bad for retail investors. Hedge funds are basically buying stock at a 40% discount with no lockup and no restrictions on sales. It is actually wrotten into the contract that they can sell on day 1, or Dwac pays penalties. This actually means they can sell BEFORE they know how many shares they get and what the price is (somehow). This type of situation can create whatbis k own as a death spiral that can cause stock prices to tank. This sort of contract meana that either dwac is super terrible at negotiating, or the PIPE investors have NO long term plan to stay invested. I expect a lot of selling pressure in the first week of trading.



2) The new ""CEO"" has absolutely no technology or media experiance. He is 100% a shill for Trump whose background is in agriculture. If you ever thought that a CEO change could save GME, then you also have to realize how bad it is to have a CEO with zero experiance or idea what is going on. He was placed as CEO not for ability but loyalty, which does  not bode well for other positions in the company.



3) I would encourage anyone even considering investing to look at the investor slides the company has so far put out. They are almost laughably bad. Under it's ""Infrastructure slide"" it lists ""users"" as ""a sales representative who travels to visit customers"". FOR A SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANY! The slides seem pretty obviously pulled from some generic slide deck without even giving them a once over. These have been officially filed with the SEC. The technology team slide gives names....first name, last initial....What does it say about the company thay people don't even want to be associated with it? The whole deck is shoddily put together and indicates to me that there isn't a good plan to actually create a social media company that can begin to compete with FB or twitter. Finally, the Trump team teased back in March that they would have a social media site ""in two or three months"". Needless to say that did not materialize. Recently, November was the target date to have a beta version of the newest site out. What have we seen? nothing. What have we heard about the development? Crickets.



4) We already have conservative social media sites and they have more or less failed. Parler, while maxing out at ~20 million users, it went from 500k downloads a day in dec 2020 to 11k a day june 2021. Gettr, a more recently published alt-right social media site has about 1.3 million downloads globally since its launch ~5 months ago. At that rate, you are looking at years before they even reach 10m. I will grant anyone that Trump will be a draw, but how much? And even if he can get users to sign up, can he keep them engaged and active? Can trump get conservative media to switch to the platform exlclusively? Maybe he has the capital, but I doubt it.",illachrymable,wallstreetbets,1.0

DWAC has about 1/6th the current worth of TWTR - if they are super successful - as a SPAC dream in their current state - they are worth 1/1000th of a Twitter, 1/1,000,000,000 of a FB.

7,2021-12-13,"I don‚Äôt mean in terms of users, I mean the quality of content that you are getting. I haven‚Äôt used fb in a very long time but instagram feels like a shell of what it once was. I used to use it to keep up with people in my life but now it uses algorithms to show you posts that will keep you engaged. Same goes for YouTube and every other platform. I have always hated being advertised to so maybe I‚Äôm just more sensitive to it, but the increased scaling of advertising has done nothing but get worse. Look at YouTube demonetizing creators who swear, Reddit removing nsfw from r/all. Of course I understand that companies need to make money and we can‚Äôt just expect these amazing platforms with no strings attached but the whole ‚Äòtracking every data point of my life to sell to people looking to advertise to me‚Äô feels so dystopian and wrong",notcheeng,wallstreetbets,7.0
