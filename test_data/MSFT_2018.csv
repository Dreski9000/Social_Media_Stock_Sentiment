3,2018-01-10,"Sharepoint is ALOT better than before. The problem with sharepoint isn't sharepoint itself but rather the administrators who design it for companies. I will admit sharepoint 2010 was horrible and should be taken out any company asap. Sharepoint online however is legit and will be the standard soon enough that companies will flock to it... if they can hire professionals to do it instead of their 20 year veteran network admin who just read a book on it. It gets a bad rep because of them screwing up when they designed it and made it more complicated to use than it should have. You really need to know what you are doing and specialize in SharePoint to get its full potential in an effecient way. Best practice weren't in yet so its kind of understanble because it was a brand new thing that admins were playing around with. Us having to fix shitty designed sharepoint in our clients system and upgrade them to the latest iteration has been one of the most nightmarish experience, I will say that.

As for docs/sheets argument, this is not true. You can not do alot of the things that accountants need to do on sheets that they can do on excel. All the Excel keyboard shortcuts around formatting and filtering are essentially left out in sheets. This means building financial models or anything requiring more than just listing out numbers requires Microsoft Excel. Things also load faster in Excel if you have a lot of data in your worksheets. Index matching is also done excellent on a installed version of excel. What sheets had was collaborative work before Microsoft caught up and did it right in Office 365. So that selling point is gone for them too. 

 This isn't to say google cant get there, they definitely can but as of right now if you want to capitalize on this as an investor. Microsoft is the way. And I do hope google does better because both will force each other to try harder to make a better product than just be a monopoly who controls everything. Because in my opinionAWS was the best thing to ever happen to Microsoft. Microsoft for a while was just coasting along not doing ambitious things with their successful products (too busy trying out other things like making a console, making phones, etc) They forgot their roots and what made them great. I believe AWS made msft get rid of their CEO and replace it with a CEO who has a background in cloud that could bring them up to speed with what AWS was doing (hence why you see such a hard push for the cloud all of the sudden by msft).",PlatypusOfWallStreet,wallstreetbets,3.0

7,2018-01-09,"What companies? Because thats not true. Our clients and many of my peers at other MSPs will tell you otherwise in toronto &amp; new york. AWS is great but it is not replacing microsoft nor is G suite. You can easily test this. Go to job posting site &amp; type aws. See how many weekly job postings (weekly because these jobs fill up fast and get taken off the job post sites whereas AWS postings last longer because not enough people specialize in it. Not to mention a part of AWS job postings are for programmers not server admins) come up related to AWS then type office 365, Microsoft server &amp; azure and see how many job postings are related to Microsoft. Regardless of city you will get the same results that favor my point of the current skills employers want from new IT staff.

The difference between the job postings are night and day for AWS &amp; Office 365 / Azure for the simple fact that 70% (might be more) of all network administrators use primarily Microsoft. You dont HAVE to know anything else to be a network administrator but you HAVE to know microsoft to some degree in today's industry(unless you a linux admin of course).  Microsoft being such a common service among companies is the same reason Linux couldn't compete with microsoft at microsoft's scale. Not that it wasn't successful, just not at the scale.  And now that cloud is starting to become the norm the transition will be towards microsoft. And the transition for them is a lot smoother going with tech they have experience with versus tech do not they have experience with (i.e. easier/smoother to build a hybrid environment with on premise msft servers combined with msft cloud services). But again the selling point for microsoft from my business' perceptive right now is Office 365 not so much Azure (though Office 365 is built on azure) .  Compare amazon's cloud growth versus microsoft cloud growth to get a better picture. its Microsoft thats swallowing the percentages away from AWS in 2017 not the other way around. https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/27/microsoft-azure-growing-faster-than-aws-google-cloud-behind.html

This isn't to shit on AWS, its a beast and I love it (my company does support it, especially their storage services). AWS still holds the majority of the cloud market because AWS had a massive early start and alot of companies are indeed built on it &amp; utilize AWS's storage infrastructure especially (ie Dropbox, though last i heard they left and made their own infrastructure). By the way servers that run on AWS are either linux or windows. AWS is just an infrastructure they dont have their own OS...  so microsoft still gets paid with an AWS setup. I mentioned alot of companies are built on AWS cloud already but that ""alot"" does not come even close to the majority of companies that are still on premise using old school Microsoft setups. They are far more likely to go the azure route now (especially one they get a taste of what O365 can do over their on premise exchange / regular office suite).

Office 365 is the first taste every company gets of the cloud as its the most logical one to do for its price and purpose. And that service is the selling point itself of cloud and azure which will be the next big step to move AD and other services offsite.

FYI: I am bullish on both amazon and microsoft. Both are excellent at what they do.

10,2018-01-09,"Buddy just do it. If I wasn't already in MSFT, I would have. Its one of those stocks I am actually debating if I should jsut gamble my 100% portfolio on an earnings. lol (but I am too conservative and a pussy to pull the trigger).

I work in IT, specifically as a IT consultant/cloud architect.  Every company/client of ours wants to transition to office 365/azure.

Right now is a critical moment to get in because a lot of servers are retiring (bought around the time windows server 2012 came out, usually companies buy it a year later in 2013 with physical servers that have 4-5 year warranty). Warranties on servers are VERY important, it is foolish to not have them or you will be paying a shitload of money to replace parts. So when servers warranty retire thats usually when companies just upgrade and alot of them are now debating between two paths they have available (for a mail server specifically):

- 1) Getting a dell server, Getting windows server operating system &amp; then installing exchange on top of that. Or....

- 2) Getting office 365 and migrating everything to a very secure, easy to use, efficient &amp; problemless (relative to on premise) setup. Which provides a file server, office suite and loads of other softwares as well.

And right now Office 365 is actually cheaper for most companies to go in the direction of. Not only year to year cost comparison wise but also because of they dont have to spend the initial $15k+ just to get a mail server rolling. We get so many questions and projects regarding this now that we might as well be a company that specalizes in msft cloud migration/deployment/supporting only company. This change taking place was evident at the last earnings (when msft hit their 2020 cloud revenue goal in 2017!) and will continue to be so for the next 8 earnings at the VERY least. so dont miss out and get FOMO! 

Just my two cents.

edit: The reason why this is big is because you now pay msft money for the full service rather than partial. That mail server you used to buy.... part of it would go to Dell or whoever makes your actual physical server. By part I mean 60-70% of the money you spend.

10,2018-04-05,"I'm more instinct,  I only place one trade a day, I have super strict stop loss, I only lose $1000 per trade, when I buy a position I immediately place a stop order equal to a $1000 loss. 

As far as when I take profits, I don't have a set limit and it's more on a case by case, one thing I am certain and does NOT change is my stop loss, I am never willing to lose more than 1 grand per trade 

I only trade a few stocks.. MSFT, FB, INTC, bigger names. Most day traders like very volatile stocks, I'm the opposite. More volatility just means higher chances of my stop loss getting filled.

I usually make my decision on what my trade of the day is around 8:30 AM or so and place my trade at the open, set my stop loss immediately after and just watch and see how it develops throughout the day. 

As soon as I saw FB pre market action up 5 pts I knew immediately that was a easy short, placed the trade at 9:30, closed it for a profit around 11:00, I'm done for the day

I either A. take profits or B. Get stopped out at my stop loss, in either case after the trade is closed I'm done for the day.

I've worked with clients who only held one mutual fund, with an original investor in msft, and I've worked with folks who hit the lottery on penny stocks. It's all about finding what works for you and sticking with it long term if you actually want to invest it.

2,2018-05-05,"I will have you know Microsoft offers office 365 for half the price for small businesses \(free for non profits as well\).

most of our clients are all small businesses. The number one thing we always do is get them on office 365 because of the immediate change it offers. It automatically resolves half the problem users typically have \(with mail, files, etc\). But we do a good job of setting it up and training the staff on how to use it for most efficency as well as share tips and tricks on the products they would have never realized on their own. We usually plan the switch during server retirement phase of the business \(when servers run out of warranty and require a replacement\). Its cheaper up front \(since you only pay monthly subscription and not a hefty cost of a server... and cheaper on the long run \(any company that is not run by morons know you have to buy servers every 4\-5 years which cost up to $10,000\-20,000 each time\).

The changes Office 365 offers to clients... aside from just getting your office suite and your email server. You basically get drop box for free, 1tb of storage per user \(excluding the shared file server that offers it own storage of data\) included in the subscription... but this one drive  integrates with all office 365 products. I cant even explain this to you without writing you a 10 page essay on all the features it has. lol.

Point being, what Microsoft has done is they are offering a way better approach to an exchange server \(mail server\). With no downtime, protected by Microsoft themselves, with lots of security and redundancy that would otherwise cost you $100,000s to replicate. This is a massive boon for small businesses and is our number 1 upgrade for small businesses.

Then msft throws in office suite that will always be the latest \(no more office 2010, etc\). If office 2019 comes out, yours will get upgraded. And then they throw in 1 terabyte of cloud storage \(like drop box\) as well as sharepoint \(which is basically a file server replacement, no more mapped drives in your ""Z:\\"" drives or anything that you must VPN in to to connect if you are out of office. No you connect like dropbox to these as well. That server that holds that data is also now on the cloud \(again included in the subscription\).  Even slack is offered on office 365. slack you pay $10\-20 a month for. for the same price you get everything I mentioned above \+ teams \(Microsoft's slack\). Skype of business... even a CRM program is being implemented \(Dynamics\). Every year something changes about office 365. Something gets upgraded, something new gets added... and what I love about it is that it is super easy to manage from an IT side of things, and the more simple the things are from an IT perceptive, the less IT staff a company will need to manage more.

Dropbox is nothing more than a file storage service.... office 365 is everything i mentioned above \+ what drop box offers. for nearly the same cost. There is no way anyone with half a brain will pick dropbox over office 365 aside from ""we are just comfortable with what we have and we dont like change"". I imagine its just idiot IT staff who set it up for you that failed to either train staff or setup things correct.

Tied with FB. Beats AMZN (7 I think), BABA, MSFT (all those around 8-9)  They grew in revenue as fast as a dude who monetized half the world in ~8 years (our man zuck)

I'll only defend myself with some food for thought. I'll re-hash these points once in awhile, I can't help it.

Profit point has been hit for auto mfg for a couple years, but everything else has been capex and R&amp;D which, in mfg is huge -- (TSLA is the only mfg example of the aforementioned tech platforms...mfg has high capex and tech has R&amp;D. Double whammy of expensive thangs) 

They are hyperspending while other auto mfgs are avoiding the elephant by putting half-assed efforts and retaining stale assets. They have to create a tesla-esque-or-better-2025 plant while still showing profit (to please shareholders) on an already razor-thin margin. If they aren't doing the definition of *kicking the can down the road* ...well, godspeed. Added bonus: they're literally paying a dividend to shareholders instead of investing in EV infrastructure. Why? [Because the board &amp; CEO are old as fuck and think short-term politics is a good thing.](https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future-ebook/dp/B00J6YBOFQ). ""Fuck that, I'm retiring in 5 years, funnel money out of the pensions and get me the fuck outta here."" 

(Existing PPOE of a car mfg is a technologically stale asset. To re-adjust for the EV revolution -- which is 100% happening -- is ungodly expensive)

As odd as it sounds, seeking a *profit* on TSLA's balance sheet at this stage is penny-wise, dollar stupid. Much like amazon and most other tech companies, the shit you do in the early stages really fucking pays off later. But much like amzn pre-profit...it was always there, but it was just immediately spent on R&amp;D &amp; infrastructure rather than cash hoarding and dividends (lol)",ValueInvestingIsDead,wallstreetbets,1.0

4,2018-05-09,"Pretty much what u/dephira said. The closer your delta (deeper ITM = higher delta, lower OTM = lower delta) to 1:1, the closer you are to essentially resembling a stock purchase. The nice thing about deep ITM calls, is if you purchase the deep ITM options on a really good underlying (Microsoft, Visa, Apple, etc. anything blue chip that doesn't have shitty underlying and generally has low IV) then you can resemble the performance of around ~80-100 shares / per contract for a lot less capital invested. Say your delta is 80, you can think of that as having 80 shares. The only time you really have  1:1 delta is if you own the stock, if you have 100 shares of Microsoft, you have 100 delta. If you have 75 shares, you have a 75 delta. So instead of buying 75 shares (of Microsoft) for like 7-8k or so, you can buy a deep ITM call for like 2k and resemble the same performance, with the risk be slightly higher as you have an expiration date instead of being able to hold forever.

Typically whenever there is a sizeable red day that seems to have no actual fundamental changes in the market, I load up on MSFT ITM calls and hold them for awhile. Last time the market dipped I bought MSFT 85 calls and held them until MSFT returned to around $94~. I was able to pick up the 85s for *a lot* cheaper since the underlying dipped to like 88, which allowed me to get a much more favorable position and my patience was rewarded with like a ~250% return on the options.

There are 2 answers here, but they arent mutually exclusive.

Depending on how those go, I may roll them into more aggressive strikes, but other than that I don't see myself changing my positions substantially this week.

If I had enough uninvested funds to make plays this week, I'd probably go for SPY/QQQ puts through wednesday (market went up a ton today across the board, and I think we see a pullback, especially depending on the tariff bullshit that's afoot) or 8/17 V calls (not sure of the exact strike I'd do for that, but either 135 pr 130 looks solid to me, depending on your risk tolerance). V essentially broke even on a day the market went up a ton due to temporary factors, and I firmly believe it will make that up and more. Furthermore, they'll have their ER coming up sometime in July likely, and V historically wrecks those. 

Alternatively, if you're planning on holding off, I think long term SPY calls may reap some serious gains.

2,2018-07-05,"&gt;  Am I limiting my upside too much by writing calls so close to the market price? Am I leaving money on the table by selling calls with under one week expiry?

Ya, sometimes. 

Like all option trades, but especially covered calls (""CCs""), a trader can do better when strategy is flexible and if they can manage a position. Should be obvious but all this talk of which deltas and DTE are best to sell are stupid - GTFO with that ""30 delta 50 DTE"" recommendations I see in other comments - there is no best. 

One needs to look at the option chain, look at the stock price and company news, look at the market beta and more, then decide which CC looks good to sell based on multiple factors. After the trade is on, then manage it as needed (such as by rolling up or down as conditions change).

Some rules of thumb that aren't retarded: it's better to sell the most expensivest shit (meaning *relative* IV expensive) and it often saves $ in the long run to close or roll than be assigned (this is more the case when there's fees, I'm guessing Robinhood doesn't charge for assignment) and a sold option expiring worthless is the cheapest way to do it so aim to get as close as possible to that price without going over, Bob.

For example: in the case of MSFT. MSFT has a dividend schedule and earnings schedule to trade around. If a trader expects a run up in stock price ahead of a dividend then maybe sell the expiration after the ex-dividend date or adjust the strike sold to avoid it going ITM. If a trader expects a run up in option IV or vega prior to earnings then maybe don't sell those cheap options as they just gona get more expensive and harder to manage and close. 

Also don't forget one can turn CC's into costless collars or call spreads too, as I'm sure you know. For example you sell a CC and then you start to worry about a market drop or just the stock correcting down after a good run up. One can take the premium from a call sold and use that $ to buy a put (aka costless collar - this protection and trade is ""free""). Example with made up prices: 

*MSFT shoots up to $102. $102 feels rich. Sell the 105 call strike for $1 and buy the 98 putfor $1. This trade didn't cost anything. The upside is capped above 105 but the trader bought free downside protection if the price drops back under 98.*

Likewise if someone sold a covered call and based on later research decides good news might be coming (maybe acquisition potential soon) and the stock could gap up, take some of call premium sold and use it to buy a cheaper OTM call (turning the trade into a bullish call vertical) - that way the person doesn't miss out on gains if the stock does a big up happy day. If one is selling covered call on a potential takeover/acquisition target type of company, something like: Selling the covered call for $1 and maybe buying a deep OTM call for 10 cents just in case can make dollars and sense. 

There's no easy answer. Gota be checking things like news, IV, VIX and calendar events and recent price momentum and then still get lucky.

12,2018-07-10,"There are some merits to this strategy, but I would suggest that a better play is the ""Asian Tigers"" portfolio.  It's comprised only of larger cap tech stocks with CEOs that are either Asian, or named Tim Cook.

Here's the basket: AAPL, NVDA, GOOGL, BABA, AVGO, MSFT, ADBE, AMD

EDIT:  My original post was obviously in jest, but now that I am thinking about it, I think I need to roll this Asian Tigers portfolio out as a tracker ETF.  This portfolio would absolutely obliterate the broader market.  I bet the 5-10 year historic performance of this basket outperforms QQQ and SPY by a preposterous margin.

EDIT 2: For any curious minds, below is how the Asian Tigers portfolio performs against QQQ and SPY.  Surprisingly, in many cases, this portfolio even has higher Sharpe and Sortino ratios than QQQ and SPY.  All percentages are CAGR (annualized returns).  Format:  *\[Asian Tigers \% Return / QQQ \% Return / SPY \% Return\]*

Even if I'm bearish on a stock, I typically just don't trade it then. I actually haven't done many iron condors outright, but sometimes I'll sell a put spread and when the stock goes up I'll sell a similar expiration call spread, which is effectively an iron condor with the put and call legs opened at different times.

EDIT: Another good option would be SPY or other index funds. Especially now where we've been trading in a range. If I wanted to trade iron condors, I might open them up and then try to be patient and sell more call spreads when the index goes up, or try to sell put spreads when the index goes down.

-Look for FD trades on Wednesday/Thursday especially - i.e 2 or 1 DTE. 

-Check QQQ before I enter big names.

There are sometimes I’ll sell itm &gt;40 delta strikes if I’m expecting a pullback or mostly sideways movement, Gotta find that balance. On a strategy like this, you can even go deep itm 90 delta strikes and sell, and it’s essentially like stock replacement as each dollar the underlying moves, you’re moving .90 (90 strike calls as of now for $MSFT), And say for Jan calls, $105 c’s are ~$8, theres 24 weeks until then, 30 delta options were .60 on Friday, 24 weeks @.60 each selling 30 delta calls and 70% winning weeks is $1440, and if it traded exactly sideways until then, your $105C is $3 itm. Basically, if it trades exactly sideways you should make a tidy profit, your break even on the option alone is $113, anything above that changes the profit profile a great deal.

30,2018-08-06,"Look... I'm going to give you a very stupid analysis right now.

There is a singular driver of health care money: Surgery. 

Surgery happens because of dumb organ systems. Dumb systems can be operated on with relative ease. 

Whats a dumb system?

The heart is. and the joints are. pretty much everything except smart systems...

whats a smart system? Well. You have three brains. 

1. Brain brain. Your CNS in your brain, and your spinal cord, to a lesser extent. 

2. Gut brain. Your intestines doin dat work all day to take all the horseshit you guzzle, and turn it into sweet tendies inside of you. They are seriously magical and have magic immunology reservoirs of unicorn value that keep your body protected from invisible demons that make you fat and broken and sick. Eat more fruit and veg. 

3. Your immuno/endocrine brain. This includes your pancreas, thyroid, sexybits, lymph, leuk, kidney-hats, and their respective hormones. They meanmug the fuck out of all the nasties and kill them with fire. They also control how you feel, day to day. Reciprocate respect and you shall be respected. 

Now.. traders often know that biotech and pharma are honeypots but they cant hit the target about how the future will play out in terms of what to invest in... I havent found any MSFT of the biotech world get talked about nearly like TSLA FB and MU do on this sub. 

What I'm telling you is, hospitals make the bank on the surgeries. That market is tapped and largely not driven by recommendation as much as it is it necessity. its inflexible. theres no, 'well, try the surgery and see if you like it!' .. no return policy. people shop surgeons but theres no surgeon to invest in... theres also no insight into investing in the best docs or hospital systems... the market there is hard to tap because of shade/mist in a consistent way for traders, is what im saying. The hospitals will keep making bank for themselves on the surgeries on the dumb systems.
 
But


If you find companies that use pills to support/nurture any of the smart systems, you'll be in a much more transparent market, where you can actually track how many diabetics there are, how many buy which pills, shifts in the market, etc, and folks that find drugs that work for them will invest in that drug for years.

I am long MSFT and want to hold shares for 5+ years.   My decision to start selling CCs was based purely on the belief that there has to be an optimal CC strike price which will maximize ROI over the 5 year horizon.   After weighing risks/ops, I decided to sell far OTM weekly calls (example: this week I sold @ $113 expiring Friday) and manage the likelihood of getting assigned.  If you're holding 100x shares of a company no matter what, you can 100% increase ROI with CCs, you just have to find a good strategy (adjusting for DTE, delta etc).",Sarfbot,wallstreetbets,12.0

No reason to  go more pedal to the metal. Reassess what you are doing. Practice. Also shouldn’t be risking 15% of account (especially if t causes anxiety).

If you want to scalp, use smaller amount of funds that helps you think clearly. 

As you get a feel, size up. Maybe practice on getting one or two MSFT options slightly OTM or ITM. MSFT 8/10 $110’s were .21 a pop this morning. Size up after you get better feel. 

Or scalp long dated options at realistic strikes. They move slow like owning a few shares.

You want to scalp AMZN? Watch contracts and write down where you’d enter and where you’d sell. Protect your capital by preparation like this. 

Good luck

you can read on some rules I use here and this was on MSFT as I suggested above

As far as PDT rules go, I read so many people that won’t close trades because of PDT when all they need to do is turn it into a vertical. Yes, it potentially caps your profit somewhat but it can also save your ASS if you hold overnight and you’re option you’re holding goes the other way.

That’s why $MSFT is perfect for this, it doesn’t make big irrational moves, and trades range bound a lot. If it runs, cap it and turn it into a vertical and manage appropriately. But you always have the long dated calls moving with you as well, just how much it moves depends on how far ITM and how high delta you have, ie $90 strike has .90 delta, every $1 msft moves you make $90, basically same as owning shares at a fraction of the cost.

On msft I normally sell ~30 delta weeklies or $2-$3 higher strike calls and if it runs away I’ll turn it into a vertical spread.

Nike is gonna dip a little bit and then get a nice boost from publicity. Honestly their move was smart. Their target audience is young athletes, not white racists. Young athletes and black people contribute more to Nike than racist old white men.

APPL announcement next week, great time to buy calls for the impending runup. 

V, I think I may wait til EOD to buy calls. Historically it looks like when V drops it's a 2 day event before it rebounds, so may even wait until tomorrow.

SQ, it looks like a good time to buy rn, but I'm also hesitant because the stock has been so hot lately this might actually just be signifying the end of its run for a while.

IQ likes to sit around $28. It's at $27 now. A weekly ATM call could be a quick profit.

FB, Twitter, SNAP I'm staying away from these. SNAP seems like it should be lower than it is, I have trouble predicting TWTR movement, and FB is going to stay where it's at until the next ER, but in my opinion that's going to be a huge risk. All in all, there's too much uncertainty in social media with Russian meddling and an upcoming election for me to feel comfortable with these stocks.

MSFT seems like a good buy right now. But it also is coming off an all time high, so I'll probably wait a few days and then see.

12,2018-09-08,"No, option premiums also depend on implied volatility (IV). This value increases when the market expects the stock price to change, or if the stock has been more volatile in the past. People who issue options contracts need to ensure they get higher premiums for stocks that are presumed to move more wildly.

For example, the relatively stable stock $MSFT has 9/21 calls trading around 20% implied volatility. $TSLA calls expiring on the same date have IV around 57%.

Now to more fully answer your question, IV can differ between calls and puts on the same stock if the market has a bias toward one direction. $TSLA 9/21 puts have IV around 66%, and thus are more expensive than the calls. Here, the option writers have more bias toward $TSLA moving downward. A good example of when this difference is more pronounced is on the ex-dividend date. On the ex-div date, the stock is presumed to move down the same amount of the dividend that's being issued (to account for the company giving away ""free"" money). In this case, puts expiring on/after the ex-div date are more expensive and calls are cheaper. ",NeutralRedditor_,wallstreetbets,12.0

How about **practical marketing opportunity**.?

How about superb AI and ML platforms?

How about upcoming $10B government JEDI contract, which only potential contender MSFT just *pissed away their piddly chances due to their display of shittyness last week.*?

What about overhauling Healthcare working with BRK and JPM?

What about their ability to destroy and incumbent in virtually any industry by leveraging their considerable tech and logistics resources?

What about their leader who is richest man in world yet still focuses on customer experience and NOT bottom line - the same man that **ran AMZN with ZERO PROFIT for over a decade**?

What about Alibaba being a joke of an AMZN Chinese copycat, oh btw Jack Ma is retiring tomorrow, reassuring?

What about smart speakers now available in almost any language, including very difficult Japanese language?

Scared of regulation? Anti-trust laws exist *solely* to *protect consumers*, but AMZN is *undisputedly beneficial* to consumers.

0,2018-09-12,"Thats tough. I feel for all the MU bagholders I see here daily. I generally don't have a hardcore fixed % rule, but as I get into each trade I usually know how much I'm willing to lose before I seriously consider writing it off and bouncing (basic TA: support levels, etc). Sometimes its 100% as I risk it all on an ER/event (but that is increasingly rare these days). One of my worst in the past few months was TIF (after earnings). I got in when it was ~$125 post ER sell off, and added a few at 123.5ish but on a short leash. After another day and high volume selling and realizing I was just not too comfortable with the position/company since I did not get the turnaround action (or at least flat action) I wanted after what felt like an over-sold reaction to a good ER, I ended up cutting out at 122.5-ish and eating somewhere around -45%. That was about -$15k on a position that never should have been bigger than $10k-$12k total all in but I mismanaged and let it snowball up to almost $30k. Looking at it now I can see that it has recovered a tiny bit, but is still not above 125 and even had a red day on a relatively strong market day. The $15k I saved from that trade was put into massively green positions in DNKN, ATVI, and MSFT. Yeah, it sucks to lose but there is actual opportunity cost to money and I just did not control my entries/splurged too much on a ticker I was not familiar enough with. ",usmc35,wallstreetbets,0.0

If you're that much of a pussy just buy shares. Neither of those companies are going away soon (I do have a personal issue with AAPL as a ""lifelong"" investment since I think they've been fucked the last year or so with business practices), however holding shares will just net you money in the long run.

Also don't quit your job you cuck. People out there love you, and even if you don't think so, you'll still hurt people by ending it all (depending on how serious you are).

""You are wrong. If the stock moves against you, The 60 delta retains a higher percentage of its value.

Go look at an options ladder. We can look at MSFT 10/26 exp. 

The $111C has a 60 delta for $3.60.

The $117C has a 25 delta for $0.98.

Now look at the prices for the $112C and $118C, which show what the contracts would cost if the stock immediately went down a dollar.

The $111C went from $3.60 to $3.08.

The $117C went from $0.98 to $0.74.

Which one lost a larger percentage of its value? The $111c lost 15%, and the $117c lost 25%

If the stock would have moved up a dollar, the 30 delta would have gained a better percentage return, as I said before. That means the 30 delta has a greater risk if it goes down, and a higher reward if it goes up.

Higher deltas have less risk and less reward. ""

84,2018-10-10,"Options are valued based on a number of factors.

So options are a derivative. That means their price is *derived* from some underlying asset (often called the ""underlying""). In your case, the underlying is a stock.

An option contract gives you the option to buy (call contract) or sell (put contract) 100 shares of the underlying at a given strike price. If the value of the underlying is above the strike of a call, or below the strike of a put, you can exercise the contract. That means you either buy 100 shares at the strike price, or sell 100 shares at the strike price.

Let's do a practical example.

You buy a MSFT call option contract with a strike price of $200 that expires in 6 months. Let's say the value of MSFT stock goes up to $250. Because your contract is in the money, you can exercise and buy 100 shares of MSFT at $200, which nets you $50 of profit per share, which is $5,000 all together. That said, you still need to pay $20,000 in order to buy those shares. The price you paid for the contract is just a premium. It's the price you pay to the seller to convince them to take the risk, it's not actually enough money to buy the shares if you end up exercising.

A lot of people don't have enough money to buy a few hundred (or thousand) shares of blue chip stocks. That's why a lot of people buy a contract, hold it as it goes up in value, then sell it to someone else for a profit.

What makes a contract go up in value? That depends on a few factors, which are called the Greeks. These are delta, gamma, rho, theta, and vega.

Delta is what happens to the value of a contract if the price of the underlying goes up by 1 dollar. So if the delta on your contract is 0.5, and MSFT goes up by $1, your contract will increase in value by 50¢ per share, which is $50 total. Fun fact: delta can be used as a rough estimate of how likely a contract is to expire in the money.

Gamma is the first derivative of the delta. That's a fancy way of saying that it tells you how much the delta will increase if MSFT stock goes up by $1. The closer you get to being in the money, the faster delta increases.

Rho describes the effect of interest rates on your contracts. This doesn't change often, so I won't get into it.

Theta describes how much value the contract will lose as time passes. Option contracts decrease in value as they get closer to expiration, which makes sense. If I bet you $10 that you can't lose 10 pounds in the next 5 minutes, that'd be a bad bet to accept. But If I bet you can't lose 10 pounds in the next year, you could probably win that bet. The value decreases because you have less time to get the stock to go in the money.

Vega describes the way the price responds to a change in implied volatility. Volatility is a measure of how much the underlying's price is moving. Options get more expensive when stock prices are choppy because the sellers are taking more risk. This makes it dangerous to buy options when volatility is high, because your contract will rapidly decrease in value when volatility goes back down to normal.

So you've got a few things to keep in mind. Is the price of the underlying moving in the wrong direction? Are you buying when volatility is unusually high? Are you planning to hold the contract for a long time? These are all things that can hurt you.

You can sell the contract so long as it hasn't expired. The sooner you do it, the less penalty you're going to take from theta decay. Keep in mind that it's really hard to unload a contract in the last few days before expiration. Not many people want to buy a far out of the money contract with 2 hours left before expiration.

If it expires out of the money then you lose the premium you paid for the contract, and that's it. The contract expires, and that's the end of that. You don't have to buy any shares.

If the contract expires in the money then your broker may force you to buy the shares. Most brokerages have an auto-exercise rule for contracts that are more than a few cents in the money at expiration.

This isn't as bad as it sounds. So long as you sell the shares right away, you should make a profit. They should give you some margin to make the purchase if you don't have enough money in your account. That said, you're going to pay them interest on that margin, and you're screwed if the market gaps down before you get to sell the shares. That could get you a margin call.

That's why most people prefer to sell contracts before expiration. It's much less risky.",ask_me_about_cats,wallstreetbets,84.0

105,2018-10-11,"I figured there'd be a post like. 

First, just a heads up to all newbie option traders trying to play the market this week. The VIX is now at 23. A very big jump +40% yesterday. The VIX is literally based on the prices of options. 

**So what this higher VIX number really means is that option prices are now much more expensive than they were before.**

Whether you think the market will recover back up, or you think it will keep falling, and you have some creative plan to trade options to take advantage of that move, note how expensive options are now. **You could guess the direction of the market right the rest of the week but the now higher option prices can be *too high* to cover the amount the market will move before the expiration = leaving little or no room to profit. Hard to get to breakeven with these prices, even when you get the direction right.**

If you're going to try options this week, now more than ever is the time to finally learn about how implied volatility pricing works.

Personally:
1) I am going to watch the market a bit before making any moves. Seen too many dumb plays trying to buy a dip on something that looks cheap then it keeps falling. Or other traders assuming this the big crash they always say needs to be coming that's been building for a while, buying puts on everything, only to see the market stop falling and recover in a matter of days or weeks. No ones knows how this week will end. I don't need to catch the exact bottom. I'm ok waiting to see a turn in direction and the speed of recovery before buying again. 

2) I am also going to spend some time today and rest of the week hunting for deals in less popular names. Everyone knows about UVXY, SPY, MSFT and MU etc. These are the types of securities with the worst highest option prices now. And they are the least volatile. You can still make money on them, but it's harder than other places in the market right now. I will be looking further into the future and lower in the money than I usually do. I will also be looking at different dates and calendar spreads. 

3) I don't usually trade credit spreads or ratio spreads. But at these prices I might be. Especially in shit stocks with crazy high option pries.

To those bros down big, we feel your pain. Be careful about doubling down. Actually be careful about making any big rushed moves after hard losses trying to recover back up without thinking twice and doing your due diligence. Shit be expensive and desperation is not a good head space to rush things in. If you suffered from a big move against you or missed out big gains this week you almost bought beforehand, we know what that's like. You can recover from losses but be open and honest about timeframes, things fall fast and it might take longer for the gains to build back up. Great time to learn about different trading strategies under different market conditions. 

For other guys thinking to take what's left in the account take a break from this stuff for a while or leave this game entirely, that's cool too, active trading for FDs is mostly luck and not a long term game, no judging, enjoy your peace of mind, you will be missed, F for respect.

0,2018-11-03,"That's like asking why do people buy calls? 

Seriously think about it, if MSFT is trading at $105 today, and instead of buying it outright you're like ""nah I wanna buy it for $110 next Friday, and Ill pay $1 more per share for you to let me do that"".

This is why we lose money.

Inversely, selling (cash secured) $100 puts on MSFT for $1, nets you paying only $99 for the shares, or collecting immediate profit if it never goes that low.

I sold some $7 Cron Nov 16 puts for $0.55 when it low. Willing to own shares at the price, but if it doesn't get that low, at least I captured ~8% profit on tying up $700 per contract for a couple weeks. If it dips to 6.75 at expiration I get assigned but only paid 6.45 so still came out ahead.

As others started, you can also sell put spreads to be a bit more capital efficient if you want (say sell $7 Cron 0.55 put buy $6 put 0.20, net credit $35 max loss of $65 for a 50% return on risk) - generally that's the move if you're bullish but don't want to own the stock, or don't have the capital to sell only a put if you use Robinhood since puts have to be cash secured and no margin rates.",guyhersh,wallstreetbets,0.0
1,2018-11-03,"If you want to buy stock, selling puts is much more profitable than buying shares outright, unless you anticipate a huge move in the near term.

5,2018-11-08,"No you make good points! I wasn't very clear because I've been working today and not able to take enough time to respond to all the comments properly.

I did not let the majority expire, but I did get a big payout last Friday from VZ and MSFT spreads that I let expire. After that I day traded spreads that were slightly OTM (long leg in, short leg out) repeatedly making 15-30% by playing the ebb and flow of these stocks many times a day using some fibonacci based TA.

Additionally, I would also buy larger spreads when I expected larger moves, and several of them were OTM on both legs which would make 40-60 percent over the span of 30 minutes to an hour.

For clarity though, most of the long legs I purchase are ITM, and I scale the short leg further out from the long leg when I expect bigger moves so I capture more of the upside faster. 

So tl:dr I wasn't clear about how many spreads I let expire, I didn't mean to make it sound that way as the majority of the gains were taken shortly after opening positions and then rolled into new positions ",Dolvido,wallstreetbets,5.0

7,2018-11-08,lmfao @ MSFT. A literal flat day,DeMayon,wallstreetbets,7.0
8,2018-11-08,"Here's what I'm up to:

1. Positions:
   1. 17 x LUV 12/21 55C. Currently up 45% and plan to hold through November. I see a big pop coming due to cyclicality (Check the LUV chart mid-Nov through mid-January) and lower fuel prices.
   2. 3 x AAPL 12/21 $220C. Bought today and think there's huge upside through the rest of the year.
   3. A few other small positions in MSFT, AAPL and T.
2. Where am I after OCT? Up 20% this week with a $3k account balance that was at $8k the beginning of OCT. My low was about $1k. My breakeven at this point is $7k.
3. Lessons:
   1. HOLD LONG POSITIONS even in times of doubt. Example: I had Nov. calls on SBUX and Puts on GE that would have saved my account balance but I let them go for break even or a little more. My gut was to keep these but weak hands are weak hands.
   2. Don't react to day-to-day movements unless you're skilled, can afford the losses or focused on day trading. Noob emotions will ruin you fast. Your actual job is more important.
   3. Focus only on a small amount of positions/companies that you are confident about. At one point I think I had 30 open positions and most were garbage YOLO's. I fed into the FOMO.
   4. CLOSE SHORT TERM POSITIONS if you're closing in on expiry and losing or only slightly winning (unless you have insider knowledge or solid DD otherwise). Stop being greedy or overly optimistic. The best trades I see on here are big money positions that makes 10-25% quickly. Burn a day trade if you have to. Don't overextend yourself with FD's that trick you into holding. Example: One day a couple weeks ago I was up  80% to $1800 on TWTR calls. I held looking for more loot and they expired worthless.  I had multiple chances to pull the money at break-even or minor losses. I didn't want to be wrong. I was wrong.
   5. Gamble with money you're comfortable losing so that you don't feel suicidal.

Anyways, happy trading y'all! Keep it fun! Take all my advice with a grain of salt. I've only been doing this since August.",muchtouch,wallstreetbets,8.0

20,2018-11-08,"I mean I could've said ""rotten fruit"" if you didnt get the picture clear enough

Apple is having issues lately, look at more stable stocks if you want *my* shitty opinion....

NFLX has been on the rise for the past few days, I've had calls on that; Dunno how much further back up it can go. Maybe $330-335? Meh

SQ calls since the recent dip have been juicy; Current dip action could be a good buy in. I think anything under $85 is solid choice at least a month and a half ish out for safe, 3-4 weeks for risky.

I fucking bought MU calls on their recent rise like a dumbass but here it is green, eh.

AMZN spreads always free money til it goes back to $1850-1900

V is stable free money lately; Bit pricey now though. Buy in around $140?

MSFT back on the rise...

There's tons of choices.

NVDA might be a good play; A bit risky but I could see $225 by 1.5-2 months out. People keep underselling how popular the RTX cards are IMO.",Kraven_Lupei,wallstreetbets,20.0

4,2018-11-11,"Little late responding. I think there's a lot more to do this that you and I haven't really thought about or written down here. I have actually been thinking about this over the past week, and I see a kind of movement or a momentum shift happening that is like the 2008 mortgage crisis. I am not smart enough to know exactly what is going on, but you have to readily admit three things: 

1. The American dream has been recast into something that is more snarling and cynical than it is hopeful and energising 

2. Manufacturing has no chance in hell of being America's saving grace, so to even use it as a political tool is not only cynical, but it's just wrong. To have so many people believing in it is dangerous. 

3. The myopic focus on anti-globalism, but a weird paranoia about China is bothersome but also dangerous. I think it's avoiding clear signals from the global economy that China is indeed important, but not important in the way that it demands destroying the living hell out of them. 

And then there are other things, intuitions. I can't put my finger on it, but over the past week, a lot of my puts and a lot of my options were heavily in the green. I exited MCD, LMT, BABA, JD, MSFT and some other tech, and then placed some more puts and calls on Friday during the typical Friday night pain. 

What's missing in the market is the optimism about earnings, and the optimism about short term gains. I don't see a lot of volume, which means smart money has sidelined itself, and we don't know for how long. But why? It can't just be interest rates. It can't be treasury yield. I think it's something to do with Trump's position and the trade tariffs and the huge huge huge government deficit, of $22 TRILLION USD. Are you kidding me? While cutting taxes? While ramping up anti-China sentiment. This is close to preparing for a war, if you ask me. ",TravelPhoenix,wallstreetbets,4.0

Executing those puts now would be 5.00 profit per stock, but since there is still time left for the stock to lose value, those puts have a little extra worth than 5.00 each. That extra worth is the difference between the stock price and the break even price. Lets say the difference is 1.00 right now so your puts are worth 6.00 each. If MSFT traded sideways, you would lose that 1.00 because tomorrow at market close your puts are only worth the difference in strike value and stock value (110-105=5.00).

1,2018-12-12,"I mean, that's simplifying it, but almost. There was this thing we used to do, called DD. It meant we studied individual stocks, because back in the before time the market didn't move as one. What would happen was you'd start to notice cycles. Some of the best meme stocks became that way, like V, MSFT, AAPL, and AMZN. Shit, even FB at one point. Once you figured out the cycle you wait for the entry point. You see entry point, you buy for 3 months out. Then you wait. 2 months in, you cash in for tendies. This was the extent of long term investing. For short term fun you pick a weekly FD or two and gamble on those, buying on Monday and selling on Thursday. More often than not the conversation on Fridays was around which one had earned the most, since they had all gone up in some way. It was an innocent time, and it made me believe that I was good at this. It turns out any idiot can be good at this when all it does is go up. Then February happened, and made a lot of people realize that this shit don't always go up. I learned some lessons then, but then we pretty much went back to business as usual. This feels different, because of the massive trading channel and the length of time. February was quick and violent, but then we started going up again. This time is more volatile and drawn out, and is actually testing the skills of many an amateur trader, myself included. In two years I'd never gotten as close to game over as I did in the first week of November. ",TrueLibertyorDeath,wallstreetbets,1.0
2,2018-12-12,"I started in August. It was criminal how buying at the money month-out call options at the end of red days on Visa, MSFT, AAPL, etc, would print money.

4,2018-12-12,"AMZN isn't really a run of the mill tech company. They can use their massive cash flow to enter a new market, run at a loss for longer than the competition, once they're a monopoly they can charge whatever they want because any new market entrant can be crushed by merely dropping profitability to zero or negative plus they now have a de facto first-mover advantage.

So all that to say, yes, they'll have a billion percent per year profit forever--until the EU and DOJ step in...if they step in. Of course, they could just pull a Microsoft and save their competition like MSFT did to prevent AAPL from going to the dustbin of history. It would be wiser to just give them a very small share, though--maybe not build them into the world's largest company by enterprise value.

TL;DR AMZN is a marketing company instead of a tech company. Also, it's a massive tax scam which evades taxes for the ultra-wealthy because you're not bothered with dividends which are positively stupid from a value perspective and all the capital gains are stepped up to current basis on death which permits massive intergenerational wealth transfer which is exempt from estate taxes and federal taxes.",BikiniATroll,wallstreetbets,4.0

If I can go back to that market of BTFD I would just do that. Short term would buy Thursday/Friday calls and sell Wednesday EOD and pick a lotto put just for Thursday selling. Give me that back with all the rich discussions.
