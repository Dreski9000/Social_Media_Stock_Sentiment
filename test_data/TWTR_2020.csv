2,2020-02-02,"&gt;You may be saying: “Iron condors are garbage because the decay eats into profits too much, but that is the tradeoff of a risk defined trade. Sure, selling short straddles would make more credit but at significantly more risk when markets move quickly.” You are wrong. If you play the Iron condor infinitely, eventually you will lose all of your money.

&gt;If you run a random iron condor strategy simulation 100,000 iterations over, the simulation will have you coming out with a net loss every. Single. Time. Each individual trade may be risk defined, but the strategy is unprofitable unless you somehow make a proper prediction about future stock prices to at least some minuscule degree. I have noticed that the vast majority of you are terrible at predicting future stock prices. Like even worse than 50/50 on over under odds.

This is 100% wrong. If options were perfectly priced then yes, you'd be right. But high IV almost always overstates the value of volatility compared to how much stocks actually move. If I run the 2/14 37.5/38.5/28.5/27.5 IC on TWTR today at 70%ish IV I'll get paid out $24 risking a loss of $76 on an ~95% POP (the strikes are outside 2SD even with the volatility taken into account) with negative vega. That's an IC that's going to have positive net profit if I get to roll those dice as many times as I want.

Plus the ROC/day on that condor is going to be something like 6%/day. I tie up $100 for 4 days and make $24. It's extremely buying power efficient and when you don't have unlimited fucking capital like a MM you have to make your buying power work not your max profit. When you start talking about buying 10x the premium in shares of the underlying the ROC is going to fucking plummet and the BPR is going to skyrocket. Sure you'll be playing safe but you're doing all this work on a position that's rapidly becoming riskier just by an increase in magnitude of its size just to try and swim upstream. What if there's a flash crash? You won't have the liquidity to keep up with rebalancing at 0.95:1 so you're not even that well protected.

ICs aren't good in low vol situations because they really don't capture theta well for the delta and of course when you need to go way OTM you're going to have problems with slippage but in high vol with lots of open interest when you have vega on your side they're well worth going wide with. If you're playing with $10K and trying to limit your position size to 2.5% they're an incredibly capital efficient way to play a lot of earnings trades, an environment where you can be all but assured high volatility that will be declining, with high success rates and positive expected values.",Veliladon,wallstreetbets,2.0

This $TWTR 35.00p 2/21 cost me $15. If I end up being wrong on the move I'll only be out the cost of a matinee ticket with popcorn. Since I bought the option I don't think I can lose any more than what I paid for the option.

I do have one question. If I decide to trade this option before exp will I then be exposed to the unlimited losses that comes with selling a put option? Or is it simply a trade of the already written contract? I believe I understand it as being simply a trade, but don't want to be wrong and expose myself to unintentional risk.",jakeandcupcakes,wallstreetbets,5.0

I am not selling a put. Unlimited loss isn't a factor.

Earnings was today and they missed expected earnings. I bought the put after earnings.

11,2020-02-07,"The case for a different kind of red week ahead:

\- Most BTFD guys here regard only 2 statistics in the Coronavirus scare, # infected and # dead.  They consistently insist, ""it's only the flu"" or ""it's a China problem."" These statements totally miss the point. Aside from the initial shock, markets don't go down because of people dying. They go down due to uncertainty or loss of earnings. Even if we had 25k dead and 500k infected today, as long as China remained open for business, stocks wouldn't crash. HOWEVER, IF businesses remain shut, people remain quarantined, and no one knows for sure when factories would start up again, then that would a huge negative for the markets. 

We're conditioned to BTFD and believe every week will be the same (maybe down Monday, but up Tues-Fri!). Due to the following points, next week should not be:

\- If there are secondary infections in other countries besides China, these will begin to show up next week. 

\- If excessive numbers of secondary infections appear in the US, then expect some sort of preliminary containment measure, which will undoubtedly be blown out of proportion by the media.

\- VIX futures remained above 16 during a +3.5% week

\- Gold remains elevated, while silver got beat up (more industrial applications).

\- This week saw a few Chinese companies declaring ""force majeure."" I anticipate this trend to continue and even escalate.

\- The increase in ""serious"" virus cases is significantly more exponential than ""diagnosed cases.""

1,2020-05-10,"Np glad to help out. Markets are a battle of knowledge &amp; transparency. Always good to crowdsource info. DM me I can send you some articles to check out. 

FYI Trading is different than investing. If youre going to buy shorter dated calls you must act according to support &amp; resistance to get buys right. If youre buying leaps then just keep adding regardless. I want to say, ROKU is my #1 pick. It is a must own imo. GMs (gross margins) will be at 50% long term &amp; will be big time profitable. The narrative is that they trade at 10x sales as the market finally caught back on. Now its holding a bull flag and threatening to break out of a long term downward wedge pattern - a strong bullish continuation pattern (its not all magic bs). ROKU could easily now begin a long term third wave after this corrective 2nd wave. Short term ROKU could go to $200, really just depends on how the market is viewing it (PINS has this same narrative on TA). If ROKU catches momentum it can easily make this move; BYND may also be making this move.

7,2020-05-09,"You sold 100 shares you don't have. That is called ""selling short"".  That's okay if you think TWTR is going down. The fact that TOS allowed it to happen says you have enough funds to cover the stock - at least for now. At some point, the shares will need to be bought back. If you sold them at $29.85 (a recent price) then buy them back at $28, you've made $185. Great job! But, it can go up and keep going up. Best to figure out a target for both directions and bail at a upper price limit. Monitor closely! These can get away quickly. Fortunately, there are no earnings from TWTR until the end of July, so the stock will respond to normal market forces, whatever that is. Good luck.",rgod8855,wallstreetbets,7.0
8,2020-05-09,"So yea like bartchart or any scanner that gives you alerts on unusual volume. Even with end of day data you can trade like this. https://www.barchart.com/options/volume-leaders/stocks

Your trading platform should have scanners you can set to alert you on high volume, high oi, increasing iv, etc. Some trading platforms allow you to set options volume alerts on individual stocks which is great if youre looking to trade something but waiting for big money to hit. Also you can tell by looking at the time on orders, like if a block is executed like WELL Sept $55 or it's tons of orders like on the SPY everyday. Also on otm calls &amp; near dated calls if you see volume higher than oi &amp; other strikes have way less volume then it's probably big money coming in. For example $CSCO May15 $50s seem like buying as the lower strike doesn't have similar volume so it's not a spread - although it could be a collar. A better example is $CCL May22 $15 &amp; $17. The volume on these stands out from other strikes &amp; seems correlated even though it's not a 1:1 spread. Could be a 2:1 spread or outright buying, regardless bullish.

Some other standouts yesterday were 
$DIS $110 $112 May15
$TWTR May15 $30, May29 $33 $35
$ATVI May15 $74
$SNAP May15 $18.5
$WORK May15 $32

You can also look at oi for past buys but again difficult to know whether bought or sold so have to be careful. Check out $LVS June $50, $55, $60. Seems like otm call buyers to me. Could be collars. Stocks with less vol/oi are generally dead giveaways. Check out $NOW May15 $350 $370 $390 oi. Or $TLRY May15 $8. Or $TSM May22 $54. Or $PDD $53 May15... 

This is really what I do to trade. Have some scanner alerts set and follow the options chain for changing volume on stocks I'm following for break outs. DXCM June $430s hit a couple days ago and really stood out to me due to OTM strike, the size of the volume &amp; the lack volume on other strikes. Over 2k contracts at $7 or $8 when they traded is ~200,000 shares which is either a collar on an $86M position or its a $1.5Mish bet. If it's the latter which I see as likely then I'm going to follow that money. Ofc I could be wrong so if it moves my way I'll look to sell upside calls against the $430s.",cancelmyfamily,wallstreetbets,8.0

4,2020-05-10,"I'm gonna edit my post and add some info but essentially its impossible to tell without having an algo analyze orders. But I can infer when volume exceeds oi that something is going on, especially when multiple strikes are bought on same expiry/multiple expirations. Let's put this in the inverse: let's say someone sold a call spread, 15k sold $110, 15k bought $112. This is certainly possible but it seems odd to do this on DIS which had low IV &amp; a bullish technical setup. Again, it's possible but I believe this is a call spread or even multiple trades of call buys. 

Take a look at TWTR for example. Compare the volume of 33 &amp; 35 strikes. This is far otm volume which doesnt make sense for debit spreads. Likely someone wants a multi-week swing trade and they're buying multiple strikes. This just happened to WORK last week. Breakout past $30 and immediately there was 5/8 &amp; 5/15 upside call volume. Take ON. Someone went synthetic long - I believe. They biught the ATM strike and sold downside puts to pay for it. Alternatively they could have a stock position and wish to hedge it by selling ATM calls and buying downside puts. This is possible but again the setup suggests otherwise. ON will benefit from 5G &amp; is threatening to b/o so seems like one of the many pre-ER run up trades.

Where I target an exit/entry change throughout the day/week depending on lots of factors such as news, current events, volume, option prices, etc. This shit isn't science with ""it has to hit the target for me to make a play"", but I use those targets to remove emotion, FOMO, panic from my decisions.


Take PENN last week - It stayed below 32 Tuesday at open and got a lot of resistance at the 31.50-32 target on Tuesday so I got a 32P. It ultimately did not get to my $21 target, but it hit a support at $29.50 three times between close Tuesday and 11am Wednesday in which my 32P made money so I got out at that price point because I know the news of casinos opening could keep people buying into it so I got out of my put Wednesday morning. I did not like the upside potential at the time so I did not make a call play once I saw it start to jump up Wednesday afternoon into Thursday because for me that would have been a FOMO play where I bought in at a top.",questionthewindow,wallstreetbets,19.0

Do your best to be objective about the situation and understand what is the right thing to do right now. In that case, I held on to the positions I believed in and bought more of the positions I thought were unfairly battered, and I have since recovered.

I really try my best to evaluate my portfolio every day and ask myself if I would buy the positions I’m holding. If the answer is no, they should be sold, you have to ditch the sunk cost fallacy. It makes it easier to figure out when a losing position should be dropped.

The style of investing here is also very luck oriented, so don’t beat yourself up for being unlucky. AMZN completely shit itself after the last earnings. It’s gone up like 50% since then. People who went long options for AMZN through earnings lost a ton of money! That’s just unlucky. If you held FB last month you got rich. If you held TWTR you got poor. If you held TWTR this month you got rich. They’re in the same fucking industry.

I definitely wouldn’t go stupid long trying to chase losses right now. Personally, I’m in only shares and those are all with sold covered calls to de-risk as much as possible aside from a select few 2022 LEAPs. And I’m staying there until July earnings play out, maybe even selling off the few remaining LEAPs. The story that excess liquidity will drive up stocks forever is horse shit, it’s just the best explanation people can come up with for why things are rising so fast.",somanychins,wallstreetbets,0.0

Gryphon is a team of web engineers who are closely collaborating with the Payments team and the Twitter.com team. We are looking for a full-stack engineer to lead the Payment and Subscription client work, someone who values collaboration as much as we do and can act as a bridge for the engineering team.

11,2020-07-11,"I haven't picked specific positions yet, but basically calls on half the expected move up by just before earnings with strike dates just after earnings (with the intend to close before earnings). I just need to determine about how far I think they'll move up by their earnings.

Here's what I see are different tiers:

Tier 1:

PTON - Gyms are getting fucked left and right and PTON is building a community of avid paying subscribers, plus just recently talked about reduced price treadmills and such, so they clearly understand the key is to now expand their base. Could be a huge disruptor in the space. And investors don't seem to think LULU's acquisition of Mirror will matter to this as it bounced back after the initial dip after that.

TWLO - I wish I had realized they owned SendGrid before their last ER or I'd have possibly gotten on that. Between Twilio and SendGrid, they're pretty well positioned in the cloud space.

NET - IMO one of the more heard-of cloud companies in recent years. Not sure if they're that sound financially, but so many people use them that I feel like they'll keep going up. Also how do you not invest in a company with ticker NET for fuck's sake?

FB - Tiktok r fuk, and Insta is implementing TikTok-like features to capitalize on it, which I just found out today. It also seems like they shook off the boycott pretty easily, which doesn't surprise me as someone running ads on there for some clients. Shit's getting expensive on there but I don't really have a choice, so I imagine many others are in the same boat.

SQ - SHOP is getting all the glory, but if SQ's online stores gets any sort of traction, they'll be mini-SHOP + merchant account + CashApp and whatever else they dip their toes into. They're being run like a company that wants to be the next mega-tech company.

CHGG (which your post reminded me of) - The shift of school to at-home makes this a no-brainer, and interesting to see them expand to other areas.

Tier 2:

UPWK - Clearly they've been benefiting from the pandemic and should continue being a strong play. My only concern is that I find it more of a platform for outsourcing overseas than locally, so I'm not sure people have had success there.

FVRR - Ditto.

SNAP - Also benefiting from TikTok being dickslapped, but I think they're more in danger of being overvalued. FB is at least profitable and has a high upside anyways.

SPOT - Seems to be becoming the destination for podcasts in addition to radio.

ZM - Has run up so much already, but is a household name and like CHGG, is a school at home play, and is becoming a staple to use within many different industries. But it's so damn high already.

Tier 3:

PINS - Don't know what to make of Pinterest long term, but social's pretty strong right now other than TWTR.

DDOG - May belong in a higher tier, I just don't know enough about them other than it's had strong movement being on the cloud train.

RNG - TWLO-lite. Heard something about them being in online video which could put them as a ZM competitor, but skeptical of their recent movement showing they're not really a strong play now. May have higher upside though given that so who knows.

DKNG - One of the only tech-ish stocks that's also a recovery stock at this point, and feels like a good time to play them as there are lots of possibilities of good news propelling it up.

WMT - This may sound silly, but if their + will be looking to snipe subscribers for at least shipping but likely other things down the road from AMZN, this could be their ticket back into the upper echelons, and they've not gone up THAT much from it. This could be like going back in time and playing NFLX was when they just introduced streaming, and no, obviously they're not YET dabbling into that, but in general them getting subscribers for anything could have them pivot into whatever they want. It's only in tier 3 because it's still a retail stock at a time when most retail is getting hammered. Less upside than pure tech.",SunriseSurprise,wallstreetbets,11.0

Not a bad year. Shit tanked with covid but eventually my long positions were making more than my shorts were losing. Advice in general is to not listen to this sub’s DD and not to compare yourself to anyone. There’s too many people in this sub now that there will always be someone with a more ridiculous gain to feel jealous of. Also don’t trade shit penny stocks and hype stocks like GME or NKLA or whatever. A couple retards are bound to get lucky on them but most will get assblasted. Stick to the proven names Iike NVDA. They’re not going vertical to make you instant 1000% but they’re not gonna nuke your account either. Don’t play shitty weeklies, in fact the longer the better if you have to be an options gambler. Personally I’ve been accumulating more and more shares over calls lately. TWTR is a play I like long term. I see this easily doubling in the next couple years due to fundamentals (increasing users and subscription modeling coming soon) and technicals and have been building up a position in 2022 LEAPs. BABA is gold. Undervalued af and people are only slowly realizing how dominant they are, they just announced their cloud business is going to be profitable soon.

The TWTR play is the only one red. I'm down a bit on that but the other plays are doing what I need them to do. 

If TWTR goes past $50 I'm going to consider buying another put. The company is garbage. The app is useless to the average person. People can get their news elsewhere, if they even care about the news to begin with, and the content on is trash. They're priced as a growth company yet their growth prospects are shit and they've failed everytime they've tried to branch out from Twitter (their vine catastrophe was the nail in the coffin). Facebook runs instagram effectively, but Twitter can hardly manage their one app.

TWTR is above it's IPO price from 2013 for the first time in a long time which indicates there may be a lot of upside in the near future. I honestly used to think it was a joke of a company, that it would be replaced eventually like myspace, but it has somehow established itself as the only reliable news source in the world for a lot of different markets and world affairs. Breaking news happens on twitter first, almost always, then filters its way to reddit, facebook, instagram, etc.

There are people who are worth alot more than me on WSB (We DM each other) they are more private than me about their wealth even on an anonymous platform like Reddit. I come on here because a friend pointed me here earlier this year and I got a bit hooked on responding to people who want advice from me.

I also posted alot of big winning trades before earnings (OSTK/W/TUP/NKLA(puts)/PINS/ LOGI/SNAP and many more! I also recommended them stay away from AAPL/ETSY/RKT/TWTR/...

As I stated I already invested in many startups and stealth startups in this area. Yes using the current ML approaches... there is research being done on much better approaches. This is why PhD is usually a requirement in non- plug and chug ML development (generalized AI is a field I do research in). It is not to replace doctors but to argument their ability to diagnosis and reduce the number of doctors required. Just like self checkout cashiers. There is still a cashier/helper monitoring 6/8 registers. It is about force multiplication.... the whole concept of automation. There still needs someone to oversee the automation. My goal isn't to replace doctors. A doctor of course has to sign off. Everyone wants someone to point the finger at. This is the same concept in more pharmacies. There only needs to be one pharmacist on site, technicians/automation can do most of the work.

Machines will eventually surpass humans. Humans can evolve fast enough. This is why the only way to keep humans up to speed is with chips implanted into the humans brain to augment our ability.
