2:57- $14.15
3:15- $9.38
3:23- $12.25

The only reasons I didn’t panic and sell around 2:38 was AMZN volume and watching the QQQ minute chart closely. If QQQ had started to dump I was going to sell, but it was pretty steady.

In between we will most likely get massive rallies that take the averages back up which will itself lift sentiment, similar to what happened at the end of the session on Thursday but much larger. After these rallies the markets will drop much farther and faster. Somewhere in there we will bottom but it will take several days, maybe a couple of weeks although I doubt with where the Fed is a drop will last more than a few days. I expect something like the Christmas selloff we got at the end of 2018 followed by a v shaped recovery. I’m holding a shit ton of March QQQ puts and weekly VXX calls so I’m not a bull but my call for a crash/severe correction is only due to excessive valuations and speculation, not fundamentals.

14,2020-02-06,"I'm going to give you a non-shitpost answer.

Investing 50 bucks each paycheck will be slow but will grow.

If you want legitimate investment advice - not high-stakes gambling which is what this sub is all about - you're going to need to find ways to cut costs and save more, and/or just make more money a year, to have a meaningful amount to invest and be able to retire safely. 50 bucks every 2 weeks will not cut it, especially if you're 30+ years old.

That said.

If you want to try your money gambling for weird options, which - if you buy risky ones - can result in either total loss of the money you spent or can result in 10x gains or higher, you might want to look at technical analysis of charts (there was just a good livestream about this here:  [https://www.twitch.tv/lazyfa\_official](https://www.twitch.tv/lazyfa_official)), and try to guess where you think a stock price will be after thinking about it hard and planning out your move, at some point in the future. Buy a call or put (call = you think the price will go to that price *or higher*, put = you think it will go to that price *or lower*, by the specified date), and figure out where you want to exit that position. Maybe you bought a call for Tesla with a strike price of $1000 that expires in June of this year, and you paid $1,000 for the call - Tesla goes up to 900 next week and you can sell that call for $3,500. Be prepared ahead of time for what price you want to sell at, and be prepared for when you're going to sell it at a loss - maybe your call devalued by 50% and it's only worth  $500 now, and you don't think the stock of Tesla will go higher, so maybe you want to sell it now and take your $500 before you have $0. Make a plan for these things.

&amp;#x200B;

But you're probably going to lose money on options until you learn a bit. Most of the people on this sub are actually idiots and intentionally waste their money on long-shot gambles because they're just gambling addicts. Don't be like them unless you actually don't give a fuck about your future or you have enough money to burn. It's fun to laugh with/at them but if you're actually in a sensitive position, don't fucking be like them. Learn how to make good calls/puts if you have only $50 a week and want to risk it in an attempt to grow it a ton. Otherwise, get more money, or cut your expenses, and put your money in ETF's like QQQ.

27,2020-02-05,"Put credit spreads on SPY, TQQQ, or QQQ are pretty decent. I would come up with a percentage gain that you want, figure out how much premium you need to receive to meet that, and then do that.

Another thing you have to decide on is if you want to compound your gains or take some out a little bit at a time. I would suggest combining those two methods if your percentage gain is enough to where you consider it a decent passive income stream. If you want to try to be a little more aggressive you can go full compounding(putting your gains from the week before into your new investment) until you get to that place.

When you do weekly put credit spread contracts for decent percentage gains, eventually a week like last week will happen and your trade might go tits up.

Here's what you do: If you're autistic like I am and go for a 33% gain weekly, that will net you $2,000 for a $6,000 collateral risk(it'll technically be $8,000 collateral since your premium is included in that collateral but you're really only risking that $6,000). Take $1,900 out of your $2,000 profit out to the bank once you've closed the position for profit or the position expired worthless(both good outcomes for you) and keep $100 for what will be your compounding yolo portion of your portfolio.

If your first week went successfully, you will have about $6,100 in your portfolio and $1,900 of solidified gains in your bank account. The following weeks, do not add any more to your yolo portion of the account unless if you go tits up. Continue to take your $2,000 out to the bank on your put credit spreads each time your put credit spreads close. After three weeks, you'll have made about all of your initial investment back.

What you do with the $100 compounding yolo section of your account is keep a careful eye on it and simply put the profit from that into the same sort of investment, putting your profits from that into next weeks position.

With your $6,000, you're just trying to make that $2,000 every week so that you can take out that $2,000. With your $100, you're tracking it and growing it with the profits it makes.

If you ever get to so many weeks in a row that your compounding yolo portion of your account is looking real juicy, then go ahead and take it out, but leave $100 in there to keep it rolling.",eboy4hire,wallstreetbets,27.0

But, it's not a big concern until closer to expiration, which is why weeklies tend to get fucked because all of the Greeks are high as shit. LEAPs tend to have low theta as you have a whole lot of time til expiration, I'm currently looking at something like 344 days.

Vega isn't much of a concern mainly because of the volatility of MSFT. Microsoft has a IV of 26%. For reference QQQ is about 18-19%. The positions have a combined Vega of like 700.

I don't think it'll be a problem, as I don't think IV will pick up for a stock like MSFT, which typically has the same IV over the past couple of years I've been watching it and I can't imagine it'll dropping much lower. If anything, increased vol will give me extra tendies. It's such a massive company though, so it's unlikely to experience some big vol moves unless some crazy shit happens.

Gamma sucks though since it's so deep ITM, so I can't expect massive moves. The combined gamma is like 8 lol

In another post I showed the analyze tool section and I'm decently confident enough that I can hedge off even a big down turn if I roll the puts out every couple of months, along with selling some calls against the position to reduce the Delta a bit while still remaining net long.",netBlu,wallstreetbets,27.0
28,2020-02-07,"I'll probably end up selling weekly/monthly OTM calls against the LEAPs to help manage the position's delta as opposed to buying puts on QQQ like I originally was planning. It makes more sense to sell the calls as it'll give tendies in the longer term compared to essentially hoping for a big enough downside move for the QQQ puts to outpace the losses. I hadn't considered selling calls against the leaps until it was pointed out by another user.

The Theta for the position is negligible, so I'm not too worried about it until much later on.

As for the overall goal, I plan on exercising some of the positions later on and longing shares at a lower cost basis. I wanted to diversify my overall positions and I felt like holding so much capital in shares was slightly disadvantaging my overall portfolio. I think MSFT is the perfect long term position, so I'll probably continue doing LEAPs in the future.",netBlu,wallstreetbets,28.0

3,2020-02-08,"Hey. Didn’t read all the comments. I sold credit spreads for 2 years as my full time job (by “full time” I mean I worked 15 minutes a day). Everything went really well. I placed I don’t know how many trades, thousands upon thousands. I sold spreads 30-45 DTE delta 12 on short put, $500 spread (or difference of $5 between long and short e.g. 150/145 strikes). 

I live in a low cost-of-living country, and was making between $2000 and $10000 a month, so I had way more money than I needed. Moreover, I had a success rate of over 99.5%, so you can guess how big of an ego I had.

In October of 2018 I decided to take my boyfriend on a trip to Paris and Beirut. I put us in expensive hotels and took us to the fanciest restaurants. 

I was convinced I had found what I was going to do for the rest of my life.

During the trip my positions started going against me. I stupidly didn’t bring my computer with me, and at that time it was difficult to close spreads on the Interactive Brokers mobile app, plus the internet was shoddy in Beirut and I just figured it would turn around like it always did and I’d fix it when I got back. I sold more spreads into the downturn, thinking there was no way it could get worse. 

On the last day of the trip we were in the airport in Paris. It was a Saturday, and I opened my account out of boredom to see that my $170,000 account was now worth $100,000. 

Over the next week I tried desperately to repair my positions but it was nearly impossible. Every day I was waking up to margin calls or $1 million or $2 million, getting assigned left and right. I was trading ETFs like SPY, QQQ, and IWM, so not even anything that risky.

By the end of the week, my portfolio was worth $30,000; and I was on the verge of a heart attack. I lost $140,000 in six days. I closed it and walked away.

I wound up having to go back to work. 

Anyways, I am writing this to you to tell you that assignment can happen at any time on American-style options. You have to be very careful with put spreads because you can easily get assigned on the short put; and if your long put has expired by the time you realize you’ve been assigned, you’re up Shit Creek.

Morals of the story - holding spreads to expiry when the short put is near the money is a bad idea; and if you go on vacation or go somewhere without good internet, it’s better to close everything before you go, or at least the positions that will expire while you’re away or are close to the money. 

Hope you are able to work it out on Monday morning!",Burnyface,wallstreetbets,3.0

13,2020-02-09,"Basically everything dropped a lot and volatility spiked. I was in spreads in ETFs like IWM, SPY, and QQQ, plus spreads in indices like SPX and RUT. 

I got assigned on a lot of the ETFs, and on the indices, which are European style, I didn’t get assigned as they’re cash-settled and I was still far from expiry, but the spreads were severely challenged and rolling them forward became very costly because of the bid-ask spreads, and also nearly impossible because I was hemorrhaging available capital. I was nearly 100% invested, so all of my spreads had theoretical max losses of $500 each or $5000 on the indices, and I got close to max loss in nearly all of them. 
I worked like a crazy person trying to adjust out but the damage was just too severe. Things bounced back later, but I kept an eye on things afterwards and it looks like I most likely wouldn’t have been able to claw my way back out of it, at least not that much.

22,2020-02-09,"Try put credit spreads on SPY, TQQQ, or QQQ. Take $6,000 and try to do a spread where you make about a 33% gain in a week. After you secure your $2,000 profit, take $1,900 out and allow the $100 of profit you keep in there to compound. The $100 is just experimental, but if put credit spreads go well 32 weeks in a row, the $100 will be about $995,496. One week before then is probably going to go tits up, but it would be cool to get there.

Anyway, so you keep track of the $100 and keep putting the profits from it into next week's trade. What you do with the $6,000 you initially put in there after the first week is just take out your $2,000 of gain every week. After 3 weeks of stonks going up, you'll have made your investment back and you'll feel a little more comfortable if things go tits up. Don't add anymore to your compounding gain yolo portion of your portfolio, you take that $100 out of the first week of profits only and just see where the $100 can get to.

Ideally, the $100 will get to an insane number where you can retire, but really it's to cushion your fall if any given week goes tits up.

Yeah, I agree with the liquidity concern. Many young traders have never seen spreads blow out while being stuck in what used to be liquids positions. Liquid ETFs generally fare better than the underlying constituents.

Got you on the vol products. I've seen too many comments here over the years of people holding things likeTVIX long, not understanding the VIX term structure/forward curve.

My thinking was that in something like the QQQ, I can foresee scenarios in which idiotic continued multiple expansion in a few companies keeps the Qs afloat.

9,2020-02-12,"Semi-DD on new positions:
I’m thinking both QQQ and MSFT could take a few days to consolidate before climbing again. Also thinking the overall climate is bullish but we have a few risk factors for short term setbacks in play so I don’t want to run weeklies right now.

I bought $4.7k of AAPL calls today (4x 3/20 $320c) at an average of $11.89 when they were slightly ITM. I feel AAPL has some catching up to do vs. MSFT or QQQ and it tends to grow more consistently than GOOG/FB/AMZN/NFLX. Thought about TSM and tech ETFs but chose to just get more AAPL. It then went on sale after the news on regulatory scrutiny (reviewing all big tech mergers?) and the galaxy $1000 pricing announcement so I’m down ~$600. Anyone who wants to join in, this looks like an easy long play became even easier with the discount. I plan to carry this call until it’s about a week from expiry and see what Tim brings me.

I also took ~$1k of positions each in SPCE and PCG. 3x 3/20 SPCE 20c @$3.60 and 10x 3/20 PCG 20c @$1.03. I’m currently flat on those taken together, up a bit on SPCE and down a bit on PCG. 

SPCE is an interesting meme stock with a lot of chatter on here. Because the space tourism business is one of a kind on public markets and Sir Branson is going to not only be the president but also a client, a lot of long term and LEAPS buyers are getting in so it’s not as pump-and-dump as for instance DEAC. To the moon!

PCG is a California utility company that is on track to escape bankruptcy so share prices have been increasing steadily. Their ATH was $71.57 in 2017, and they dropped to ~$45 through October 2018 when they were engrossed in a huge wildfire settlement that ultimately looked likely to drive them to bankruptcy. The all time low was $3.55 just back in October 2019 when bankruptcy looked imminent. There were a lot of swings as the government decided whether to burn them to the ground or not. They now have reached a final settlement on the wildfires that leaves them solvent, and the stock has been strongly appreciating since then. There have been quite a few quality DD posts on PCG here over the last few months and the general sentiment is bullish.",johntaylor37,wallstreetbets,9.0

21,2020-03-01,"I did the same thing. Tues/Wed bought March 31 SPY puts, sold them Friday when SPY was \~$290. if I waited to end of day when SPY went up I wouldn't have made as much as I did. Held onto a \~1.5k QQQ put which I bought too late on Thursday which ended up -30% by EOD Friday. Also didn't 2 TSLA puts on time before the 1000% gains started dropping to 600% EOD, and ended up holding them. Gap up Monday can easily wipe it out.  


I think that Mon-Wed we can see gains, but that can turn out to be a dead cat bounce which could lead to further drops, especially if the market starts to worry about a recession. I might day trade some SPY calls Mon-Wed, but if there's a big run up I'll buy more end of March puts (maybe even April).  


Lastly just be aware you aren't allowed to day trade in TFSA, and if you run up a mid to high 6 figure TFSA and get audited by the CRA, your gains will be subject to capital gains tax. Some people with high 6 and 7 figure accounts have already lost cases in court so there's precedent. There's no hard rules on how many trades you are allowed to have per year in your TFSA but it's very easy to rack up over 100 trades if you are buying and selling something every week.

Yes I did buy a couple cheap TSLA FDs that failed early in Feb, but I made 8x on a mar 6 $725 Put. I could have held it a day later and made 16x but risk of a big QQQ rebound was too high given price level relative to MAs.

Germany now has over 100 cases.

European recap:

France, German, Italy all over 100 cases and growing exponentially.

UK is at 33 and likely to break a 100 cases in 5 days.

Hence, Europe has fallen.

US cases are starting to rise and we'll likely be at 100 community spread by end of this week.  Then US will fall.

Headlines to anticipate next week:

1. Pope is hospitalized.
2. First coronavirus cases in NYC and Washington DC.
3. Circuit breaker triggered on QQQ.

27,2020-03-03,"but why? So far TQQQ has followed 3x QQQ to the tee. It still follows as it should. Why do you have a feeling that TQQQ in particular will be below 30? 

&amp;#x200B;

You keep talking about their portfolio being short on cash, having too many stocks, out of futures, needing to purge stocks, etc. But you won't explain why that should cause TQQQ to deviate from its expected movement. Are you implying an eventual liquidation because Proshares can't sustain following 3x QQQ? Because saying that TQQQ will be below $30, is just saying that QQQ, or the Nasdaq 100, will continue to fall as investors sell MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, FB, etc.  


I'd appreciate it if you could reply to 404\_Find\_Me's comment below, where I replied. My replies aren't very helpful by any means.

3,2020-03-05,"I've been trading options for a long time and it's always been sort of back and forth between gains and losses, except two years ago right before October 2018. I took a 12k loss which was a lot for me, but I also noticed deteriorating mental state. Couldn't sleep, watched futures all night. Was up before market opened. Was checking my positions every 10 minutes. Etc. 

I took a step back, took my loss and bought shares, a few into individual stocks and a few into indexes. I kept fidgeting with it, even with the shares, I was looking for that next best move. Kept selling one ticker for another. 

Then October 2018 hit and I was down an all of my holdings, down another 20-30%. I knew I was in some well established names. I decide, I'm going to hold. Like most investing advice is, long term is your best bet. So I closed my app and forced myself not to look. Slowly, I stopped checking. My sleep returned, I became happy and I stopped worrying about the market. Forgetting about it almost. It was eye opening how much we over analyze and over emphasize daily movement which is just noise. 

I came back to my portfolio a few weeks ago, right before the major drop. I had made all of my losses back and then some (due to the massive rally in 2019). I ended up pulling everything out right before the drop and just buying QQQ. I hedged with a way OTM put and made up all the losses I'm taking on the current drop and now I'm just selling covered calls, with those profits I sometimes do a yolo but that's it. No more putting over 25% of my portfolio into a yolo. 

Sometimes we need to take a step back. Turn shit off and come back in a few weeks. It's the hardest thing to do, to step back, but it's the only thing that can save us.

Either party, TQQQ or the bank, can back out at any time with no repercussions. You can see this if you look at their balance sheet - not just the value, but the total number of swaps they own has been decreasing as they rebalance and back out of leverage.

And to be honest, the interest they have to pay on new swaps as they rebalance is probably going lower by the day, considering banks will probably do anything to diversify their risk right now. So if anything their leverage is probably getting cheaper.

42,2020-03-06,"PSA: Funds like this don't leverage themselves through loans, but through Index Swaps. Swaps aren't like loans, and only exchange income, rather than actual money. Instead of paying the bank interest and principal so you can buy a house, it's like just paying the bank interest so you can get the rental income from the house, but at the end of the day no property is exchanged and the bank still owns the house.

What does this mean for TQQQ? They will never get ""margin called"" because they can sell their index swaps just as easily as any of their other assets. The swaps are very liquid, since they are a form of transferring income and NOT a loan. So they will never actually implode overnight like XIV, which died because of overnight market swings and wasn't margin related. 

That being said, this doesn't mean they're not in trouble. Triple leveraged funds suffer a lot in very volatile markets. Imagine you put $100 in QQQ and TQQQ. Next day QQQ goes up 10% and TQQQ goes up 30%, so you have $110 and $130 respectively. Day after, QQQ goes down 10%. Now you have $99 and $91. QQQ is only down 1%, but TQQQ is down 9%, even though it's only triple leveraged. So TQQQ is probably kill, but it probably won't happen in the next two weeks.

8,2020-03-07,"Ok bud you obviously missed the point of the other dudes post so let me spell it out. The logic is this. TQQQ is overleveraged in QQQ and the market. They are buying the dip as you explained. So the debts at the end of the day NEED to be settled. So when the market moves in their favor they can rebalance and take some money off the table or leave it but when the market drops they need to pay for the losses that are owed. Because they are over leveraged in the market if they run out of cash (as you are seeing) they will need to liquidate shares to pay what they are owed. This is the catch, if they are liquidating massive positions it will cause their share to drop since they track the market, which will cause them to owe more and need to liquidate more, which will cause the market to go down further increasing losses. And around and around they go until they go bust extremely quickly. That was the point [/u/dlkdev](https://www.reddit.com/u/dlkdev/)  was making.

There's some structural bullshit going on behind the scenes with debt and stuff. TBD. If there is a huge drop, then sell the SPY puts and buy calls on the gold miners dated for Jan 2022. Gold and gold miners will bounce back really quick, so it's a chance to win big. Double tap style.

If there is not a huge drop, gold miners will still 2x/3x in the near term. Gold miners will peak after the bottom. So jump right back into QQQ and maybe renewable energy.

2-0 means they sweep the best of three finals.

2-1 means they lose once in the best of three finals (win/lose/win, or lose/win/win)

The inverse bracket is the ""loser wins"" bracket. In other words, the ticker that loses every single round is the winner of the losers bracket. Tickers that have a redder day, or lesser green day, move on in the inverse bracket.

First buy was NFLX, which did well last recession as the cheapest media source with the largest library.  They get negative press because of many players (like Disney) pulling their content from streaming.  But all those titles are still available on DVD.  If people get poor and do what they did before, NFLX is going to get a big boost in DVD subscriptions.  


The other buy is AMZN.  They have famously automated warehouses and deliver.  Everyone who is too scared to go shopping is going to finally learn to shop online for everything.  My friends in China are getting 100% delivery of everything, and if the outbreak continues to worsen here I expect the same.  Next quarter earnings will bear judgement on that call.

If they think there'll be an upside or downside within the next few days, then they'll probably get it and sell it back when it reaches a certain profit. So they'll buy it at 3.50 because they think they can sell it back at 4.50 or 5.50 in a day or two. Buying this for a long term play does not make sense right now with the IV for those options. Selling a covered call or put could be alright for a long play. I don't play around with spreads so I'm not sure how well that would work with the current iv.

&gt;There is a **security specific** circuit breaker system, similar to the market wide system, that is known as the ""**Limit Up** - Limit Down Plan"" (LULD). This LULD system succeeds the previous system that only prevented dramatic losses, but not speculative gains, in a short amount of time. This rule is in place to combat security specific volatility as opposed to market wide volatility. The thresholds for a trading halt on an individual security are as follows. Each percentage change in value has to occur within a 5-minute window in order for a trading halt to be enacted:

    &gt;**10% change in value of any security** that is included in the S&amp;P 500 index, the Russell 1000 index, and the Invesco PowerShares QQQ ETF.
    
&gt;30% change in value of any security that has a price equal to or greater than $1

The main problem with all of them is they are the highest weights in SPY and QQQ, the two most popular ETFs.

However, at the same time, when people put risk back in, these are the first ones to recover and they are consistent in the recovery (the airlines or cruises or hotels might ""jump"" more day to day sometimes but are all over the place).

1. 10x $200 QQQ 15Jan2021 Call
2. 10x $180 QQQ 15May2020 Put

For a long time I have been long tech equity (AMD/TEAM/MU/SQ, yes I am meme friendly; i am still holding that equity, didn't sell anything) so I ended up buying QQQ puts to hedge. Originally I held 10x 200/180 QQQ June Put spread (bought this January). Mid February  I bought out the 180 short leg and as QQQ crashed I rerolled the long leg to earlier date/lower strike at every ~100% gain keeping cash (took out about $30k cash out of originally $3.8k spread). The lowest/nearest puts I had were $170 QQQ Apr, but in the past 2 weeks rolled it back up to $180 QQQ May. I probably will not roll in up/forward any more and just let it expire in May worthless if the uptrend continues.

I bought the $200 QQQ Jan2021 Call this Friday.

January is basically 6month after when I am fairly sure US confirmed will start decreasing (hopefully earlier!). When I bought it $QQQ was ~$181 so I chose $200 as ~10% out. I do think that with all the support the financial markets are receiving this will not be a prolonged recession so hopefully we will return to previous $230 level, in which case I don't care what the $VIX will be.  

Although realistically I am already thinking of rolling my calls to higher strikes, taking out cash as we go (went from 12k-&gt;18k since Friday). On the down slide this lead to me extracting more cash from the puts than my original $200 QQQ June put is worth now.",ivalm,wallstreetbets,2.0

As an options holder/buyer one has to be able to ""go long"" and be strict with following risk and money mgmt and understand how to pick tickers/contracts having the ""greeks"" with best potential and avoiding those with the worst potential. Similar as it is in the world of investing in mutual funds/ETFs in a 401k/IRA (diversify and avoid pricey managed load-fee funds) there is such a thing as diversifying in options trades (not all-in on SPY or SPY and QQQ, place only small % on a position, include a contrarian position, don't overpay, always keep sufficient ""dry powder""/cash equity that allows for repositioning in trades you believe in but market moved against in near term, have plan when to enter/exit before making a trade, don't get emotional, cut losses sooner rather than later, etc).

The truth is I’ve never looked at QQQ before.
Tracking across companies is likely a safer bet, but looking at the options table premiums are lower than MSFT due to the expected lower volatility (as a result of being an aggregate measure of companies).

Given that, the higher volatility of a single company vs an index should lead to higher premiums.

You need bigger moves.  VXX fucking moves when it moves.  ZM, TSLA, AMD all can move 10% over a couple of days. 

Study meme charts - BYND, ZM, TSLA, SPCE, TLRY. You can ride the waves up and short the way down after they start to drop. If you can only figure out one, you'll still make stupid money.

The global dollar shortage and massive amounts of dollar denominated debt that’s going to be defaulted on in the coming weeks/months is the only thing that matters.

I’m okay with losing it all but I’m expecting ramp up before and if not then I’ll hold through earnings. Nvda is a solid company that hasn’t done me wrong. If the market decides to fall apart and drag Nvda with it then I have 5/15 $197 QQQps that will soak up some damage.

I’m playing with house money so I’m ballsey and greedy in the current situation otherwise I would have kept all of my puts and just ignored the day after day of green. 

If everything goes to plan then I’ll swap out the Nvda calls for some qqq, spy or dia puts for August then just withdraw the rest of my money and just piece out until they’re worth something nice.

Lastly, one of the reasons I’m going w nvda is because I followed it closely in Q4. They always report their earnings later than the FAANG group and Q4 they absolutely crushed earnings but had less than a weeks worth of time to climb before the entire market collapsed and dragged them down.

Nvda only made it to $316 before the world fell apart. You might say current price is high relative to its ath but that’s because it wasn’t given a fair chance. I’ve been playing the ramp up from 240-260 then 270-293 since April. I think ramping above $300 by 10-20 dollars even before earnings is just giving NVDA the even playing field they deserve.

This is also coming from the person who tried to catch the Nvidia knife in 2018 when they fell from 270 to 130s. I wouldn’t be messing around w them if they haven’t proven that they’re better than they were two years ago when they missed.

So for example, I have been using 283 as my short leg for any calls, while using 280 as my long because qqq is at near ATH, and we know tech has a hard time going down. Thus, spy will have a hard time tanking past levels like 283. Furthermore, 2-3 Dte has very heavy theta drain on the short leg and thus you can get profits like 20% per day. It’s Also a bit more risky though, if you get blown out, then you only have 3 more days for it to come back your way. As for your spread, you are already at max loss, so I recommend leaving your spread as is, if at any point spy goes down a bit, you can bail out. But again, do go too bearish on spy right now because imo it’s hard for it to crash since tech is maxed, if the other companies gain even small amounts, spy jumps, for example look what happened tonight.if spy is going to crash, tech needs to crash first. So I wouldn’t hold bear spreads overnight. If you are rich, you can run like 5 bull spreads every 2-3 days and just buy a single long dated put. That way, when the market crashes, you’ll break even, and your spreads might be ITM by the time it recovers anyway.",putgambler,wallstreetbets,82.0

0,2020-05-11,"Things I'm looking at this week: 

SLV: finally broke out of our triangle, looks like we're testing the gap. Likely seeing 15 EOW. SLV 6/19 15c for sure. 

IWM: Likely testing the gap again. Broke out of the middle of its channel, has room to run. Personally think IWM pulls the market up this week. This will have the greenest week if trend holds. Still a ton of catchup to do. Retest and hold at 130 = IWM 137/142c spreads. Probably my biggest play this week.

QQQ: Another run at the gap. If QQQ fills, IWM fill rapidly follow. If IWM runs to fill, QQQ likely will as well. Logic says correction to 220 for a retest, so I'm reserved, but if IWM takes off QQQ may be lifted by rising tides. QQQ 228/232c spreads if I see support at current prices.

SPY: Huge pivot point. Trend says 300, RSI says correction to 288. Probably not touching this week unless I get a golden short opportunity at 300 or long at 288. Too tricky. 

WTI: About to make a huge breakout, we'll likely know EOD. Personally think we're seeing 20 by Wednesday for a ton of reasons, but too soon to tell. 

VXX/VIX: Both at the bottom support of their respective channels. Both scream correction to upper level of channel. However, other charts look bullish, so this could get interesting. Watch VIX very closely at open, any break below and its VXX 27/25p spread all day.   


Keep in mind December Fed bonds went negative last week, and that Powell speaks on Wednesday to almost definitely address this. Anticipating an uptrend to price this in Monday.",TheDolleyLlama,wallstreetbets,0.0
1,2020-05-11,"Both sides (already priced-in, not-priced-in) are wrong.

1. long-term ""already priced-in theory"" ignores the obvious fact that interest rates are zero. if you treat fed interest rate as opportunity cost, your reward/risk ratio approaches infinity. All equity pricing tilts to short-term, here and now which is logical because this is an emergency and price signal is more important than ever. 
2. corona deaths and # of waves will not impact spy as much as fear of shut-down because the market is amoral. rolling shut-downs will behave similarly to electric grid blackouts and brown-outs. You still pay your utility bill even if the service was shitty or you ended up with your internet being down 50% of the time (AT&amp;T) As much as I find that to be an immoral idea, the number of waves or deaths should not interfere with the pricing in price discovery. we need to know which services are out there working and serving people using investor greed as rocket fuel. But wait, the fed is rigging the market, how do you get price discovery? It's a good question and it's loaded one. Risk ladder looks like this:  
\-----top (riskiest)-----  
marketshare growth (growth stocks or &gt;80% yoy rev)   
&lt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------QQQ here   
earnings growth (focus on forward P/E&gt;2x current P/E)   
&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------SPY sandwiched here   
value (focus on past p/e maintained below SPY P/E)   
asset-based investing (book/price value=1 and highly sensitive to fed interest rates)   
\---bottom (safest)---  
Turning interest rates zero re-arranges the ladder and makes the sweet spot at QQQ. Why? good balance sheet and strong cash flow = evidence of survival in this environment AND necessity of this service to serve the population in this emergency. This is all temporary or rather, long-temporary, which means that is the short thesis is right, then the equities market is dead and your winnings from a spy 180 is as good as monopoly money.  

3. With that being said, it's a long-standing fallacy that risk is priced in dollars. It has always been priced in realism(physics/weapons/positive emotions) but it's hard to quantify. What is severely underlooked is the spectre of virus mutations and  re-infection on survivors. This will cast a long shadow. Right now, a vaccine needs to race against the rate of virus's unique strain mutation (Oxford study [https://www.newscientist.com/article/2236544-coronavirus-are-there-two-strains-and-is-one-more-deadly/](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2236544-coronavirus-are-there-two-strains-and-is-one-more-deadly/)). If the virus mutates any deadly strains beyond the scope of current vaccines in development then we might as well reset the 18 month clock and begin a new race while having strict quarantine to start a neverending war against the virus. basically, by opening up and jsut letting herd immunity take place, we've opened ourselves up to the risk of collapse. optimism has hijacked realism and that's why risk beign priced in dollar is bad for society.
4. discontent, unrest and eventual institutional break-down will cause an immense doubt in how all this market pricing actually serves society. if people are doing lousy dd and just gambling or throw into index fund for retirement during this zero-interest rate time, then price discovery is dead. SPY going up is an artifact of it having a real value of zero. Who wants to have a board seat of a company that makes no money and no customers want to have any market interaction with? but an spy 200 world in 2020 will make your puts print like a one-eyed king. you got rewarded for being right and greedy.

That is absolutely no argument against the fact that the IBEX has been down 50% from its high 20 years ago. Or the CAC with -30%.
Because thats a number based fact that can not be argued against.

&gt;If you DCA all the Europeans indexes for the past 20 years, you still end up making money.

Maybe you would break even. But why would anyone want to invest in that garbage when stuff like SPY, DAX or MSCI World exist, which provide a stable upwards trend? Actual profits. These just completely outperform the rest of Europe.

Most companies pulled or reduced guidance for the upcoming quarter, so I don't believe that he's correct. If I guessed, sector rotation will cause tech to sit flat for summer or go down slightly, but large cap tech stocks are still seen as the best long term play in the current economic environment.

Do you think Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and fucking Pepsi are going to crash in the next 3 months? I understand the argument for Apple specifically (I don't agree with it, but there is a logical argument there) but the rest, no fucking way.

it will take a while due to how leveraged ETFs work. the underlying holdings can recover their pre-covid share price, but REML will not have gotten there yet. look at TQQQ vs. QQQ as an example

REML got blown up pretty bad because mREITs crashed so spectacularly

that said, I think it's a good hold so long as debt/mortgage defaults dont happen. most mREITs are still undervalued because of this fear despite the recent pop (finally)

the top holdings of REML are by far the safest plays in the sector tho, esp. NLY and AGNC (govt backed mortgages)",Turlututu_2,wallstreetbets,0.0

Won't make any crazy gains, but with that kinda capital it will still yield a good chunk of change, and most importantly, it lets you buy the dip (assuming there'll be a 2nd dip) while still making money while waiting for said dip, and not having to time it. 

Do the buy high IV stock sell CC's thing with most of the rest, just make sure it's stocks that won't get completely fucked long term by everything going on.

11,2020-06-06,"Down 60% on my account these last few weeks (all in on QQQ puts) so I've spent the morning going deep into some data on the St. Louis Fed website out of rage. How the fuck is no one talking about this massive wave of deflation hitting us? I see every moron talking about ""brrrrr"" and inflation but here are some graphs that will change your mind.

Look at the [velocity of money](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V). Massive drop in Q1, will be even larger in Q2 in my opinion. [CPI](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL#0) has obviously been declining, what if it doesn't recover? Also, the Fed has their [deflation probability](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/STLPPMDEF) for May at 76% after it was only 39% for April.

I might research this more and make a long post about it, but can someone explain to me why we aren't selling off a little on deflation worries? Deflation will literally collapse everything thanks to the Fed's massive balance sheet, corporations issuing debt at record rates (with insane debt to equity ratios already), and consumers piling on credit card debt. 

What evidence is there for inflation? QE in 2008 didn't cause inflation, [low rates don't cause inflation](https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2015/number/6/article/when-low-interest-rates-cause-low-inflation.html) either The dollar index has been tanking, but the price of gold has too.

Don't.  There is no strategy to easy money.  600% overnight gains are like putting it all on 7 at the roulette wheel. Big wins,  miserable losses.  

Money management is key.  Without it,  you're out before you've even started.  

IM assuming you made that 75% on shares.  Nicely done.  You can't trade options until you get 2k in your account and get margin.  Don't.  That's literally taking a loan out to gamble.  

My advice?  Disciplined swing trading.  Watch live trader on YouTube.  Manage your money well. Don't risk 80% of your portfolio on one play.  

Lastly,  and please PLEASE listen.  Do not TOUCH options until you've traded for at least a year.  Then paper trade options for a month to get a handle on it.  They're so risky and much more complicated than these guys make it out to be.  Your first option should be a spy or qqq call.  Basic, simple,  easy as they come.  Learn or become a loss porn statistic 

For reference,  I've gone to COLLEGE for this Shit and I don't touch options.  Yet, i fully plan on it,  and I'm fairly confident on calls, but that just shows how risky they can be.  

The play I'd recommend is a swing on banks.  Start with $XLF. That's the ETF that tracks major financial institutions.  Start with that.  Learn the various patterns us technical nerds look for (squiggly lines my guy). 

Pm me. I'm more than willing to talk trading with you.  I work mondays, Thursdays and Fridays so I'm not super active then,  but i have a job that allows me to chat semi actively at work and check charts.

And when it inevitably fails, he can hold for 10 years until QQQ comes back which is what he should be doing anyway. 

Only caveat is to make sure he doesn't have any margin AT ALL when he writes the puts, because the sequestered  collateral will kill him once the market tanks and he'll be forced to liquidate shares. 

That much money could give someone a lifetime of security. Risking it is just horrifying. If you want to gamble, write puts on something that will still be around 20 years from now.

61,2020-06-08,"I know it feels like you're missing out on am awesome bull market (and you are), but there's always more opportunity in the future.

If I dumped every penny I had in my brokerage account, I'd be about 60% of your account - not small, not huge. Here's what I have learned about my trading by reviewing my wins and losses:

I almost always lose on big (25k+) plays and win on small (&lt;5k) plays. On the big plays, I'll see a few thousand loss, lose confidence, and bail out. On small plays, I'll see a much bigger % loss, be confident in my thesis, and hold for gains.

I lose almost all my day trades, win almost all trades I hold at least a week. 

Tight stop losses almost always trigger for me. Setting a 2% stop loss in this market is basically a guarantee of a 2% loss - stocks trade up and down 2% a day all the time in this market. Don't buy if you're not confident enough in your research to look at a 2% loss and know it's fine, it'll go back up. Or buy less, risk less (per play). 

I am about 50/50 on bought options, and 95/5 wins on sold options. Check out r/thetagang and read up on selling cash secured puts - it's a great way to make some money while waiting on a good entry point to a stock you like.

I'm up about 9% on SPY, up an average of 20% on shares in individual companies (even though I bought into spy earlier in the bull run). Individual companies are better than etfs for me when I do the research.

EDIT: I forgot an important one - I have seen my best returns on long dated (120+DTE) calls. Every time I buy options with less than 30DTE, I lose

There are lots of good sectors/companies that are still trading at 40% or more under ATH, so don't just look at FAANG. Not saying FAANG is overvalued, just that it feels a lot safer to invest in something like USFD, XOM, BA, JPM that's still well under ATH vs buying into AMZN or TSLA (or etfs like QQQ) hoping it continues to moon well over ATH.",TJnova,wallstreetbets,61.0

7,2020-06-10,"Since you seem to be legit asking...

The S&amp;P 500 is an index (not a stock) which is a collection of “key” stocks picked to represent the entire US economy.  A committee picks 500 of the largest (not necessarily the 500 largest) US companies.  Other major indices are the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the NASDAQ.

Indices were originally a way to judge the health of an entire sector or the entire US economy. You can’t invest in an index though.  For a long time you couldn’t invest in the S&amp;P 500.  You could always buy 1 share of each company in the index but that is pretty expensive.

Recently (in the 90s and 00s) ETFs have emerged to fill this void.  ETFs (electronically traded funds) can allow you to invest in an index.  The details don’t really matter.  ETFs buy shares of the companies in the index and you buy shares in the ETF.

Each index typically has an ETF.  S&amp;P 500 has SPY.  Dow Jones Industrial Average has DIS.  NASDAQ has QQQ.

Bonus knowledge:  These ETFs I just mentioned attempt to reflect the index just at a cheaper price.  When the S&amp;P 500 goes up by 10% then SPY should go up by 10%.  When S&amp;P 500 goes down 5% then SPY should go down 5%.

There are “leveraged ETFs” that attempt to track indices on steroids.  They often attempt to do something like grow 3x faster than the target index and fall 3x faster than the target ETF.  For example, QQQ is the ETF for NASDAQ and TQQQ is a leveraged ETF for NASDAQ that targets a 3x multiplier.",februaryleaf,wallstreetbets,7.0

Can you tell my why Today: DIX for S &amp; P 500 was 47, but for SPY (when you log in)  it was 66? Is there a different calculation for the market as a whole and the ETF?

Last 4 days it was 61 65 48 66

Also: It looks like SPXL was in 30's until May 20th and people started stockpiling until 2 days ago (45-50 range).

DIX for QQQ 66 69 43 51   and SQQQ looks like people have been stockpiling since Mar 20th dropped a couple days ago and went to 58 today )45 38 37 58 last 4 days).

All are looking a bit extended beyond the 4 day so I mainly trimmed and took any/all profits today. They may digest tomorrow. I do a bit of scrapping when I have the time... For example, at one point I had bought puts on AMZN today and watched it fall 20pts and sold for a profit by watching RSI, VWAP, and when QQQs showed back strength. I then switched over to calls and rode it back up. Ive stayed away from most ETFs and usually just use them as references to look at sector trends (SPY, QQQ, IWM, XLF, XLE, JETS). BETZ is a new ETF that I’m long in once Sports gets back online. It can also use it as a reference for GAN and DKNG. 

For options remaining, I only have GLD and SLV...  I bought them two days ago expecting Powell to cause it to spike once he talks about zero-interest rates. Commodities are tricky so sold 80% at EOD.

If you are going to expose yourself to risk by taking a position on a bet, you should do yourself a favor and take an opposing position based on your risk profile. Maybe 10%, 25%, 50%, whatever.

Taking the opposite side of your bet will ensure that if the market moves heavily against you, you will not go broke. Right now I'm heavy on calls, but hedged about 10% of my position with buying calls on SQQQ ( which is short QQQ 3x leveraged fund ). When the market dropped today my SQQQ position went green. If we have another huge dip tomorrow I'll be making a nice profit. If the market recovers, my calls go back up.

they will exit eventually and buy again.

102,2020-06-11,"Your viewpoint on vaccine was the most likely 3 months ago, but a lot has changed.  In particular, MRNA phase 1 data showed neutralizing antibodies, as did CanSino ADV phase 1 trial. Those have some similarity, but are different, and its a strong indicator that things will be fine when you put that together because the similarity in payload means that one working should mean the other more likely to work. Both seem to be working.

I think the Moderna vaccine works at least 18 months after administration (it may or may not cause robust t-cell response, but it definitely causes SOME t cell response and does give immunity), and if it gets dosed into areas with disease in July, it likely gets an approval for emergency use in late oct, and broad use in early dec, and that'll be enough to dose about 150m Americans by end of year because production starts I believe next month. It's also possible it gives many years of immunity, but even if not, 18 months does the trick to beat this outbreak. 

I don't think more than 150m Americans want it. But that's herd immunity. And people who are nervous about going out and avoiding economic activity will be the ones who cave and get vaccine if they were on the fence.

7,2020-06-13,"They took on substantial debt, they also have good bookings. They're currently priced exactly as the market wants them.

The Cruise lines are volatile, but have shown a steady gain since the March bottom.

If you bought in then and haven't sold, you're in a good position regardless.

Saudi Arabia backed Carnival, taking an 8% cut of the company. Carnival isn't going bankrupt. Let's say the worst happens, and they need to raise capital.  You would have a dilution, or them taking on more debt in the private markets.

It's a long term speculative play, with a high upside. If you're already fully vested with 75% of your portfolio in long term buy and hold stock anyway, there's a good chance Carnival's stock will outperform Apple's, AMD, MSFT, QQQ, ETC, at least over the next year. 

If you ALSO have outside money and you aren't sure how to invest it, Putting it into a cruise line isn't a terrible idea.

Is the market acting a little crazy and unsure how to price damn near every stock?  We all know the risks of investing/gambling. If you set your time line out far enough (beyond next week, or month) stocks keep tumbling upwards.

Who's ready to be a bag holder if the market changes it's mind next week?  Cruise line, airline, hotel, Vegas stocks aren't for everyone and you shouldn't be making single entire portfolio plays into them, but as part of a more complete strategy.

There's nothing wrong with a FUCK YOU YOLO, but if you have the bankroll, why not spread your risk around to different sectors.

Banks aren't acting any different than cruise stocks, but no one is calling anyone crazy for buying Wells Fargo. 

BAC went from $28 earlier in the week to $25 this week. Why isn't anyone calling someone who trades BAC crazy?

It's just what we actually care about when trading anyway usually for most person. We want to put Xyz amount of dollars to work. It's rare you need a specific amount of shares unless you want to sell options against them.

Edit: I would never place a trade in shares using ibkr unless it was for the purpose of selling calls against. There is absolutely zero reason for me use a share order vs a dollar amount order using their system. 

Between their order type, type to trade (I use excel and just paste my orders in), margin, and features, it's the best trading platform for stocks period. 

Portfolio margin access here, due to the margin rate, means you would be insane to use another platform.

Edit2: I will say for this sub it could be bad. If you're a greedy fuck, this thing gives you access to the tools to wreck yourself hard if you really don't know what you're doing.

8,2020-07-03,"This will probably get buried but I think financials are prime targets for shorting short/mid term. I do alot of trading around leveraged credit, bonds and equities. A while back out of curiosity I researched what banks held the swap contracts on a particular leverage product set (TQQQ/SQQQ) obviously these are x3 leveraged so to find out the direct beneficiary you have to find out the principal derivatives holders in this case QQQ swap contract holders. (If you trade leveraged equities/products you'll know what I mean by defining the principle swaps that are included in the basket, simplified the leveraged securities are based on the series trust so in this case QQQ which tracks NDZ (Nasdaq100). Its a bit more complicated than that given they take into account future pricing as to avoid time decay through options modeling, but that isn't relevant for context purposes. ) Anyways, no surprise the main holders GS, JPM, C the main wall st invs. But, some of the substantial holdings, especially for the inverse were held by bnp para (not really surprising given size) but also CS and UBS had sizable holdings. They're priced around $10/$11 a share respectively. They're contacts even 40÷ days out are under $1  , ones with 7/14 to exp are around 0.06/0.25 Obviously the open interest isn't great given the sizable position you could easily build up. I'm still generally bearish short term ( yeah yeah whatever gay bear ) but even if the market continues up next week the contracts are priced so cheap for a limited risk exposure anyways. I'll be picking some up of both given the healthy discount nature. 

&gt; banks hold both sides of the swap (obviously to hedge) but are more exposed to volatility through rebalancing of both assets.

Anyways, I'm not spending the rest of the weekend on here so happy 4th weekend to the Americans from your European bro for the rest of you pubs are open soon so relax 😂

Tldr;  UBS/CS are undervalued imo given they're holdings of leveraged equities swaps relative to size. I see volatility picking up next week so puts on UBS/CS mid term. Exposure is limited given price of contracts either side so if market continues up it's limited risk.",KykoKata,wallstreetbets,8.0

A lot of people are losing their shirts trying to short this market because, as we all know, its completely detached from fundementals.

Then there are the momentum traders that are trying to ride the trend with options and losing to theta.

Safest bet is to stay in cash and buy the dip. 

Also, when buying the dip, write cash secured puts 10% OTM a few months out (I like the Oct 260 SPY put) and use the premium to buy calls. You can mix it up with the calls buying FDs, a few with 1 week expiry, and some that are further out.

Worst case scenario, You own SPY at 260, not bad at all. Best case, market bounces right back and you double some positions while capturing a 25% to 30% return on others. Best of all, if market moves sideways, theta decay on the put write offsets the calls.

SPY is one example. If you don't have 26k to write a cash secured put, find another fund or individual stock that correlates well with SPY or QQQ. Most important thing here is liquidity, you want a stock/fund whose options trade with tight spreads.",Big_Moe_,wallstreetbets,0.0

2,2020-07-05,"I know the popular opinion was Corona news makes us red af. But I genuinely believe, and I’ve been bearish on the market, that we’re going to see a large rally this coming week. 

If politicians even whisper the word ‘stimulus’ we get a pop. More importantly tech has been leading while travel and retail lags; although retail is an obvious problem given COVID issues, numbers came out from UK and elsewhere that show retail is ready to roar once they are open. 

The previous cycle was COVID fears= take money out of value and move it into tech, and that’s why we don’t have red days much. Red days are QQQ booms now.  Coming this week I think we’ll see the opposite swing— people fearing the ‘tech bubble’ will burst, seeing that some inevitable bouncebacks in airlines/retail will come to fruition down the road, and taking their tech profits and putting them there.

Hedged with some calls which is why I didn't lose everything  but the losses are huge. I was short right before market went up 40%. I've decided to never get puts again. It's only calls or cash gang because the trend is overwhelmingly up and any downward action is short and brief.  You don't lose money being cash gang and you can actually step away from the market and play video games or go outside or enjoy your life rather than charts every damn day. Also stop getting otm options they theta decay the most and I bet that's what you're doing. Always get 60-70 delta options itm and if you're not sure make a small collar with a cheap option on the other side to not blow you up if there's a 10-20% move in the stock price.

 [https://imgur.com/gallery/MXmHNjs](https://imgur.com/gallery/MXmHNjs)  
 

Has there been an instance where SPY assets increased while # of shares decrease? Yes.

2009-2010, 2004-2006/07. 

My implication from this post is that the likelihood that hedge funds, financial advisors, mutual funds, etc... will look for returns elsewhere given that the FAANG index has had a ridiculous run over the last 10 years. One main driver of the market of recent years has been FANNG+M, and earnings expansion as part of the equation. The distortion of returns with something like RSP, DJIA vs QQQ/XLK/SPY on a YTD basis is quite remarkable. If you take out the FANNG+M out of SPY, the return is closer to the DJIA YTD number. 

Some of the other WSB’s picked up on this “This is the least dumb post today so it gets no love of course. But I think you’re right. Value and international have underperformed growth. I think we will see rotation from growth to value. EM should also benefit if US continues to get rona fucked.”

Looking on the surface the implications that SPY and other investors are too overweight Tech screams bubble in every aspect. Of course, with the Fed printing money, whose to say it will stop? If you have a 0% risk free rate you get TINA and FOMO, which has been happening to an extreme. Maybe those still rise and these stocks could easily rise with them. But I think is more likely to happen is the large tech companies start to level off. As this happens i believe money managers will be looking to rotate their money elsewhere in other stocks that have value. This has happened many times in the past. 

This chart on a percentage basis from 1999-2002. We can see plenty of instance’s where tech was high and Coca-Cola or RTX proceeded to outperform MSFT on a short term basis over the next couple quarters. This should present some opportunities for some calls if we get a good 20% pop on some of these stocks  
 [https://i.imgur.com/hhS081i.png](https://i.imgur.com/hhS081i.png)   
 Why? Longer-term, stocks like RTX and MMM outperformed MSFT through the 2000 bubble crash. Clearly MSFT is different now then it was then and MSFT is one of the most reasonably valued tech comparatively. But as we face a decade of a potentially depressed economy.  Could we have Value make a start to outperform like it did through 2000?   
 [https://i.imgur.com/b2c7Ixe.png](https://i.imgur.com/b2c7Ixe.png) 

 Maybe this is all too long term thinking for WSB’s. But When looking at a comparison now. I can’t help but think we will get a pop up in some of these stocks:

If you find a company that you think is going to have explosive growth and broad market has not caught on yet, yeah sure--get in now.

But, if you're thinking of buying QQQ, TSLA, MSFT, AMZN, or AAPL while they're at ATH. That's a FOMO trap. 

You're supposed to be selling into optimistic markets (when prices are high) and buying during fearful markets (when prices are low). 

FOMO leads to buy high because feelings are strongest when market optimism is brimming and stock prices are surging. 

Investors driven by FOMO should never time the market and just dollar cost average because waiting for FOMO to push you into a stock will always lead to buying high. 

FOMO, for example, was not poking its head out in March when everything was 50% off. 

Lastly, there will always be an opportunity somewhere in the market. I look for irrational movements across all stocks/ETFs that meet certain liquidity thresholds. Lately, I've been writing DDs on some of my favorites. 

Two I have invested in recently that I did not write DDs on are LHX (holding 7/17 180 calls at 1.50) and PLXS (bought shares at $62.76).",Big_Moe_,wallstreetbets,84.0

The issue is that these etf’s DO have bids( demand) and asks (supply) 

Qqq is 10 percent appl, so if people pull out 1 million dollars from qqq, it has to go and sell 100,000 worth of appl stock. 

This gets very tricky with leverage.  Because if people pull 1 million dollars out of tqqq, it will sell 3x as much, but appl is the most traded stock in the world, so say it is still rising as money comes out of tqqq, the fund manager has to maintain the close tracking, the money has to come from somewhere.

If you use a ""real brokerage"" you get access to ways to completely ruin your net worth can auto buy/sell, etc. So really, this is just the same typical media hype.

Financials, energy, industrials, real estate, travel, entertainment, and several other benchmark sectors of the broader economy are still off 25% or more from their February peak. The only sectors that have recovered are technology and healthcare, and healthcare has only recovered most probably due to the federal government guaranteeing reimbursement to health insurance companies and hospitals directly.

Why do you guys fuckin play SPY? Is it the volatility? Do you just love trying to time massive sell orders?  
I've tried it once or twice and failed (obviously), or I'll predict a move but don't have the balls to take it, so I gave up on that.  
I started going long tech, and hedging my self with huge volatile share positions in the DJIA. Long as fuck on the QQQ, with 111 shares of BA. When BA rises this week, and QQQ's correct because of uncertainty/tech earnings, I will sell some BA for a fuckload of profit and double down on great QQQ entries. Profitable in a few days.

They are smart enough to out compete any other company regardless of market if they found the opportunity warranted. Mchi is important because most of qqq has major usd influence and im predicting continued usd decline. Gold is further hedge on volatility.

Euro market is a good bet as well but from my perspective the number of private companies makes it difficult to easily invest in the most competitive people. Also europe has wealth transfer laws that make it difficult to be an up and coming person, so ambitious people often choose to move to another part of the world until they are established. At a certain point... perhaps $100m net worth europeans have access to ways to hide their wealth and can move back.

10,2020-08-01,"Qqq and mchi will take some explaining, but i will caveat that any regionally insulated asset will be a good place to stash money in this future and those selections of mine (qqq, mchi) depend on a number of other assumptions which i am less confident about.

Here is my thought process: USD is currently seen as the most stable asset you can hold. If that assumption is in jeopardy, there will be considerable exploration for a new status quo. I believe consensus for the status quo will be reached by the thoughts of those whom are successful at selecting assets which perform well (wealthy investors). I believe their consensus will diverge from looking at asset prices in terms of their value in any fiat currencies, as wealthy investors have a predisposition away from holding currencies directly.

So where will consensus shift for a baseline to measure all other assets by? I believe the stock market will begin to be the yard stick other assets are measured by because the market of risk to profit, as valuated by the stock market's value versus total global assets, is actually fairly stable.

If that assumption holds, then which stocks will be most trusted to represent the gold standard of the way we value the world? I believe the answer to that boils down to which stocks have the lowest risk, and i believe the lowest risk stocks are not those of a particular market, but instead those with the most competitive people leading and operating them. I believe those to be generally tech stocks.

My vote for qqq is based on the idea that human capital, as measured by the value of risk to profit in stock prices, will be the compass rose of asset valuation in the future. Mchi is added as a hedge against qqq's usd influence.",1ncehost,wallstreetbets,10.0

Put many thoughts into this over the last months and came to the conclusion that, for young gamblers, aggressive investing should be key to fast portfolio growth.

Dividends (to replace regular income with passive income) don't matter if you have a job, imo it is always better to allocate your max leftover cash for buying aggressive stonks/ETF and gamble with a small amount for precious tenbaggers.

29,2020-08-04,"Oil and gas are literally at 25 year lows.

RDS.A is trading at $30/share. In 1994, RDS IPO'd at $27.78/share. Adjusted for inflation, you can buy it today cheaper than you could have bought it then. 

I am not stupid enough to short a bubble, just know that when QQQ topped in 1999-2000, it did not fully recover until 2015. Since then, it has been on a 30%+ annual upward trajectory. It appears to me that the selling in tech in March were margin calls. My guess is that firms were levering tech shares to make other investments. Everything sold to meet the margin requirements, and now that $3T has been injected back into the markets, firms have doubled and tripled down on technology.

Consider that SPY is back to basically $330 without energy, real estate, financials, travel, and many other sectors. Do you honestly believe that when things do begin to churn again organically that tech will maintain their current valuations and the other sectors will recover back to their pre-COVID prices? If that occurs, SPY will run from $330 to $500 over the course of a year or so with unemployment near 10%.",Hacking_the_Gibson,wallstreetbets,29.0

3rd time in 3 weeks QQQ has tested 270 and hit the brakes. We'll have a down day before the stimulus is passed, and once it passes we'll have ATH on SPX within 2 weeks.

39,2020-08-03,"1) You are a RE guy, not a stock/options guy, stick to what got you to the dance - more RE

Then play a big chunk of it as a hedge against your existing RE position. Something with positive carry so you are slowly making money for holding it but will pay out big if RE takes a dive. Then you have a chunk of cash to pay down your mortgages or buy more property if/when it goes tits up.

I'm not sure about the correlation to RE in your area, but maybe put ratio backspreads on a heavily residential REIT, or the same thing on a bank heavily exposed to residential RE?

Ou could calculate what your % equity is on your RE holdings, then come up with a position that will protect you against a market correction of greater than that amount. Im sure there are tons of knowledgeable RE guys who talk about this sort of stuff.

2) In my opinion, having RE, tech, gold etc doesn't really make you safe anymore, it's all a play on the Fed succeeding in relating the bubble (see #1)

if you want to diversify wait for a sell off in the next few months and put a moderate chunk of it in QQQ and GDX stock/leaps

3) Then, take a small amount of it say $10k and play around, and learn options. Almost everyone fucks up with learning options, starting with more money just means that lesson is more expensive. Once it's gone, it's gone, so make that 10k last as long as you can.

big tech like does not get fucking velocity.

SPCE gets velocity. DKNG gets velocity. FSLY gets velocity. shit like AAPL MSFT AMZN just doesn't.

last time one of them had velocity we used it to like battering ram 327. built up momentum with AMZN but it bounced off. tried with AAPL and MSFT but it bounced off too. but AMZN AAPL MSFT all together broke through. so maybe we're gonna go at 330 now.

but I've also seen us bounce off 323 and be 6% red.

dunno for sure if that's the plan or if we're just gonna fuck around all day because it's not like the big boys send out fucking group emails. so you just gotta read what they're doing and sorta go along with their plan.

also on a macro level judging by foreign market action lately i think foreign markets are starting to see solvency issues and if the market thinks the next stimulus is going to take more than a couple weeks then

1. lot of rent/mortgage is going to be missed and loans will have to be marked underperforming. collateral needs to be posted

""*GDP declined -32% last quarter and the market raced higher.*

*Q2 Earnings Season showed a 35% drop in corporate earnings and the market raced higher.*

*Coronavirus cases DOUBLED and, you guessed it, the market raced higher.*

This disconnect from economic reality has all the markings of a stock bubble. So why should the music stop at 3,300?

I sense that investors want to touch the all-time high at 3,393 the same way a young child needs to touch stove to learn an important life lesson. Just no amount of lecturing from the adults in the room can prevent it from happening.

To believe that the worst economic event in our lifetimes only resulted in a 3 week bear market when the average bear is 13 months long is absolutely fanciful and borderline insane. Aka…the markings of a bubble.

The main question at this time is WHEN is the bubble ready to burst. Again, I believe that is September/October because that is when I suspect that this modest bounce in economic data rolls over and goes quite negative once again. Plus that is when we will be faced with the unknowns of the Presidential Election which usually lops 5-10% off stock prices.""",BlueKnightJoe,wallstreetbets,35.0

Look at QQQ chart you can see if you make horizontal lines around those two numbers.

I think we short term over extended and you see bonds come up. Mega cap tech is just a bond proxy with regards how they are pricing growth and risk. It bonds rise, the risk premium is not favorable so stocks will go back down.

26,2020-08-08,"While I agree with you in principle, I can't bring myself to trade options in my 401k...but I've done a variation on your theme.  

10 and 20 percent pullbacks -and the subsequent rebounds- are facts of life that one (sort of) gets used to, but having experienced 2000 and 2008 (and having read about major pullbacks in other times) it looked like another one was brewing in March.  I experienced a 15% loss in my 401k before deciding this was the real thing and switching over to cash.  As the markets stumbled further downward, I did some thinking and studying. 

For over 30 years, my money was invested in low-expense ratio index funds...I'd read John Bogle's works and he made sense to me.  I'd been happy with the returns and, over time, my account climbed well into the six-figures.   But even a casual reading of the history of Wall Street reveals that black swans and ""hundred- year events"" have a habit of recurring.   Besides the mere fact of repetition, they have other things in common: each is different from the last; no one sees it coming; and those with money are bailed out first.  I love capitalism and the free-market (?) system, but when taxpayer's money is used to bail out banks who then foreclose on the homes of the taxpayers, while simultaneously giving themselves bonuses for a job well done, well, it's easy to see there are a lot of suckers in this game.

As in 2008, the Fed stepped up this time to prop up the markets and that was my signal to try something different.  I opened a brokerage account as part of my 401k and began buying individual stocks.  The volatility can be frightening but my account is up almost 50% since April.  At one point, I'd made 2 years salary in 3 months.

Many of the companies I've bought, I found here.  I love this sub and there are some very smart people hanging out here, along with some beautiful retards.  I can't buy some of the wackier stuff, companies with no products or facilities to produce them that are somehow valued in the billions of dollars...but there are a lot of real businesses out there to invest in and, right now, the ones to avoid appear obvious...all the more reason to avoid indexes where you have to own the good with the bad.

I'm smart enough to know I've been lucky and realize returns like this can't continue forever.  When the stimuli end and the Fed decides to start raising rates, I'll go back to QQQ.",DonSho52,wallstreetbets,26.0

Worst cases if you end up going over your 3 and get hit with PDT:  
- move to a new broker 
- if with TD, call and say “my bad.” They’ll remove the PDT at least one time, maybe more

Or:  
- open a Spread to lock in your gains instead (sell calls one strike higher)
- or if you can’t do that, buy a put on the same security, or one that moves with it (like QQQ if you have calls on AAPL)",gmcarve,wallstreetbets,62.0

Anyway knowing there is a rotation is useful, u can front run the algos (but it's not free money)

For instance, Banks showed strength on Friday but GS was lagging midday. So i went all in, and what do u knew it went from -0,5% to end the day at 1.97% just like all the other banks that mooned earlier on Friday. XLF strength carried over today which i ddnt expect i closed my financials position.

rotations end abruptly and qqq usually shoots up big as the dow shits. Best way to play it is to buy when there is weakness. Tech looking good today, last week with BA RTX JPM XOM shitting the bed XLI/XLE/XLF were good plays. Not quite sure if this qqq beatdown is done just yet",the13thrabbit,wallstreetbets,75.0

the GLD, SLV pullback could be interpreted as a sign of reducing hedging, which could mean there's less risk in either holding cash, or putting it somewhere else; maybe a good sign

the 7-10 year, and 20 year treasury bonds ETFs (IEF, and TLT) were also down for the day. could that be a sign that interest rates may increase? again, a positive sign for the economy

16,2020-08-12,"I don't know to class you as a retard or a moron.

You buy as it drops... this is done to stocks, not options. Options have a time limit. I don't know if you have iron balls or you are a masochistic to leave everything to luck... Can't you at least come up with some reason.... regardless of how absurd... but reasons NIO will rise again?

\*Faceplam\*

\----

I'm also holding onto my NIO... at least the 13c and 14c... sold the higher calls this morning after price drop and rebounded to around $14.50.

I'm holding because I'm **confident** NIO will rebound in the next few days. Not blind faith. 

1. I've already mentioned on my first [NIO pump post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i2mibg/nio_monthly_delivery_be_ready_to_pump/): NIO isn't like penny stocks, the pump takes days. 
2. An extension from the above, if you look at the earnings on May 28. NIO went down too. What happened 2 days later? Rocket ride. Will history repeat? Don't know... but it happened before, it can happen again.
3. Market rotation. Money is moving around, mainly from Tech to others. QQQ down while SPY and IWM both went up. This started last Friday. When it happened previously, it didn't last long. I expect money to flow back towards Tech soon
4. Upcoming news. On Wednesday, we have CPI index and EPI crude inventory. Thursday is unemployment claims... Doesn't matter these report are good or bad, it'll be a wake-up call; A reminder to all, we are still in a crisis. Speculative big money may once again move back to ""safer"" grounds... NIO, after an excellent earnings report, is pretty low risk, high reward... very attractive for the speculative investors.

In addition, Tesla comes along with a stock split... unexpected assist, but I'm happy nonetheless. I've mentioned this many times, Tesla is the market leader, when price of Tesla rises, all EV related companies get free rides.

\---- 

If my information is wrong, I made bad judgement or just being unlucky... I'll take my loss. Playing in the market is gambling after all... However, I'll never trade based solely on faith, not to mention doubling down...

""*GDP declined -32% last quarter and the market raced higher.*

*Q2 Earnings Season showed a 35% drop in corporate earnings and the market raced higher.*

*Coronavirus cases DOUBLED and, you guessed it, the market raced higher.*

This disconnect from economic reality has all the markings of a stock bubble. So why should the music stop at 3,300?

**I sense that investors want to touch the all-time high at 3,393 the same way a young child needs to touch stove to learn an important life lesson. Just no amount of lecturing from the adults in the room can prevent it from happening.**

To believe that the worst economic event in our lifetimes only resulted in a 3 week bear market when the average bear is 13 months long is absolutely fanciful and borderline insane. Aka…the markings of **a bubble.**

The main question at this time is WHEN is the bubble ready to burst. Again, I believe that is September/October because that is when I suspect that this modest bounce in economic data rolls over and goes quite negative once again. Plus that is when we will be faced with the unknowns of the Presidential Election which usually lops 5-10% off stock prices.""",BlueKnightJoe,wallstreetbets,42.0

So in sim city, you need lets say,4 residential areas, 2 commercial, 1 industrial, per unit of city

Cities Skylines has great charts. Tons of charts. Love me some good charts.

Your city will grow and industrial space (the dow) will grow slowest, as 1 factory can supply many commercial storefronts, and those store fronts will grow more rapidly (they are the S&amp;P) and at first be how you generate income, but long term you make money farming residential zones, which grow the largest and densest, and represent the tech saturation of multiple devices per person (so the QQQ)

Many people need some businesses need few industrials, and the growth in a simulated city matches the differences between dia, spy and qqq, of usually say, up 5, 10 and 15% respectively on a month

So industrials will lag to the up, and also lead to the down, and also persist in relative stagnation for extended streches",galactictaco42,wallstreetbets,324.0

55,2020-09-03,"AAPL is fully valued for the next 5-10 years with a price of 120. The current bubble is a function of low interest rates and perceived zero risk of bankruptcy.  A safe- haven for rich people to hedge against inflation, and better yield than Treasuries. 

Fundamentally,  nothing changed since a year ago when it was half the price.  Same near- zero growth,  same phone +1 camera.  Same shit. Historical PE was 10-20 over the past decade and that's with higher growth.  20 might be reasonable, but it's some 40 now .  Add in share buybacks and in 5-10 years.. it's worth around 120.

Just look at the dot com bubble.  Companies had stupid valuations, QQQ crashed 80% and didn't recover until 2015, some big tech still hasn't. 

Find an undervalued growth stock,  hold that forever.  That way you can get 20-30% annual returns for years,  decades.  Apple.. no chance it's an $8T company in 6 years.",kfuzion,wallstreetbets,55.0
56,2020-09-03,Try this Xlk $140 call expiring in March for $748. This is almost as good as those thing specific ones. And I understand that the low volume on those other spook some people. Doesn’t bother me and I’ve sold them before without any issues. But I suppose if they were not doing well you could have trouble buying them. XLK and QQQ are much more liquid.

2,2020-09-04,"Still way above 200 dma, and 50 dma, and just looking at a few tech names the RSI bounced off 80 but I’m not sure it’s found it’s support. Individual stocks have different RSI levels they will bounce off of and I don’t think any are really there yet. I expect another down day for sure within the next 2-3 trading days. Then it can begin anew from there. 

For what it’s worth, looking at QQQ, Appl and MSFT last time RSI was at or over 80 for each was 6/10. And it fell 6/11. They all hit 80 recently, and fell big today.

Feels like it was an intentional dumping today given all the 9/4 options expiry held that were likely ITM and now no longer are. But the RSI also suggested it should happen. MM probably shorted a shit ton to drive it down. Take out stop losses. And shake out some of those paper hands. I don’t see it going up tomorrow, again, those 9/4 expiry. If anything I expect heavy shorting selling pressure to continue.

95,2020-09-04,"If SPY falls below 0.9% and/or QQQ falls below 1.8%, then we'll be trading below the 20 day moving average. After hours is already down 0.6% and 1.5% respectively. If we cross that moving average by much, then we might fall as far as 4.8% and 9% respectively.

for both SPY and QQQ, 0dte put options for -0.05 delta will cost about $0.2 at the open and be worth about $2.5 if they hit the money. That's a 12-bagger.

If you buy put options at the money on the open for about $2.5, they might go to $14. That's a 5 bagger.

My gut says that either this market turns around within the first hour tomorrow or it will be even more red than today.

If we open below the 20-day moving average, I'm going to buy -0.05 delta lottery tickets and some lower risk -0.4 delta puts.

101,2020-09-04,"Look at RSP

What is RSP?

RSP is the equal weight ETF 

In our last mega crash 6/11 guess what, that week we fell 13% from ATH. Yet today RSP is down only 3%. Yet SPY/QQQ is down heavy in same way as 6/11? Can someone explain?

Yes. It's because tech is carrying the market of course. So a cool off in tech sends the index down. But if you look at XLE, XLU, XLF, GDX, these were nowhere near as much down. 

Conclusion - they want to rope everyone into puts over long weekend and reverse hard for next week. This cooloff needed for continued bullish growth to ES 3800 by November.

Another thing to consider - SPY rebalancing is taking place tomorrow with the details released. Rebalancing will conclude in the next week with funds buying etc. Cutting out the weak performers means that when we bounce SPY will bounce harder than before. 

TLDR: buy the fucking dip. No, this is not a March crash. No, this is not a liquidation event. Yes, the Fed will backstop this move down like they did 6/11. Yes, the pullback was necessary to pull us out of overbought.

124,2020-09-03,"Here's a tip for new permabulls before you blow up the account buying the dip tomorrow blindly. QQQ is now 283 which is the one day chart moving channel average. Lower channel is 279ish. If it breaks below that, wait. If it goes below 279 and holds/continues to go lower and lower, target is 272. If that also breaks, target is 267ish. If that breaks too this is a month of gains wiped out and we're potentially in a new leg down at which point Vix is probably in it's 40s. Don't buy the dip unless qqq holds 283ish. 

AAPL below 114 (likely tomorrow pre market) is at bottom level for expected move but daily RSI is only half way down so we can easily keep dropping. Tesla expected price target is 400 for this week and we already cut that with butter knife. 346 is next real support.",acoupleoftravels,wallstreetbets,124.0

Just someone answer me this. Where is the money going? As far as I can tell there is nowhere else to park your cash than the tech sector.

Bonds &amp; fixed income are fucked due to zero interest rates.

Crowd favorite municipal bonds are triple fucked because so many cities face bankruptcy due to not receiving federal funding for covid.

REITs are mostly fucked due to garbage rental market and collapsing retail.

Oil &amp; gas &amp; energy is fucked due to oil prices.

Retail and consumer goods are fucked due to covid.

Holding cash? JPOW just announced we’re returning to 5% inflation.

You could buy metals but they’re at ATH too.

Everything is fucked while the megacaps are reporting record profits &amp; growth. So where are people pulling their money to? What’s the idea? Because the way I see it, the only sensible option is a swift QQQ recovery from today’s crash, but mob mentality says it may extend into tomorrow as well.

But as soon as SPY drilled through 355 I knew today was fucking different. Sold all my calls right there for a 3k loss. Then I loaded up on 60k worth of SPY 345 9/18 puts.


That's right. 60k. I've been waiting for this SPY crash for a long time.


BUT... because I've been psychologically conditioned to get in-and-out quick with SPY puts (due to getting fucked one too many times), I quickly sold all of them off within 30 minutes, for a 4k profit. Ended up 1k for the day, feeling pretty good about myself.

I made $10k by buying +20 QQQ 293p 9/4 when it was trading at 296 or so. Sold when QQQ hit 288 and recovered a bit. I also sold +50 QQQ 270p 9/4 for 0.22 -- I bought them the day before yesterday for 0.04.

I took a beating though because I was holding a total of about $200k in TSLA and MIK and MSFT (about half of that was in margin).

MIK had great earnings but went down anyways. I plan to hold those shares for a few weeks -- I expect they'll recover nicely.

MSFT will moon when the tiktok deal is announced. still holding.

I dumped my TSLA shares at 412 and will stay out for a bit until things cool down there. I'm still bullish on TSLA given the upcoming s&amp;p announcement so I'll buy back in at a better price.

Overall for the day I'm down $5k. Could have been much worse.

Looking forward:

I think QQQ will underperform SPY for a while as the tech sector rotates into the broader market.

QQQ correlates most closely with a tech-heavy portfolio. TQQQ is just the triple-levered version that you could short directly rather than using puts (since leverage and options both amplify returns, you don't need to do both). 

Just be mindful that you are looking for a hedge, not a complete offset. There are lots of calculators online to tell you your option payout if you own a security depending on how much the underlying stock moves.

The purpose of beta weighting is to correlate delta between different underlying assets. You have it set to SPX but there is no delta so it's not actually doing anything. If you add delta it'll show you how much QQQ and SPY you have in terms of SPX.

Levered etfs work such that the unlevered etf can move around and end up back at where it started, but the levered version could actually be lower. 

Hence the 50% example. 

$1 in qqq , assume 16.67% drop, you now have 83-84 cents. A triple levered etf would be down 50% (16.67 x 3). Now that investment would be worth 50c. 

Let’s say market goes back up 20% so now your .83 x 1.2 = about $1. 

Triple levered etf will go up 60% (20% x 3). But it’s only going to be worth 80c. So despite market ending back where it started, because you used the levered version, you actually ended up worse off than when you started. 80c vs $1.

I'm using max pain ([https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/options-max-pain/QQQ](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/options-max-pain/QQQ) ) for QQQ on 9/18 it's $270. Am loading QQQ $270p 9/25 on pops.

I expect some turbulence as the election nears... and I'll play accordingly.

Here's the game I'm really playing though, because I restarted from 500:

500 \* 2\^0 = 500

Reduce all values by half if you want to become immune to gambler’s ruin and set a natural stoploss at half your account.

Martingaling or semi-martingaling with a ratio rather than just doubling from a small amount is more ideal. The more something dips, the more certain you are it rises, so it’s gambling with an edge.",lnvisibleGhost,wallstreetbets,17.0

\* Started April 17 with $740

\* Peaked September 3 with $17,998

\* Currently at $10,090 because I think puts are un-American and didn't move into them yesterday like I should have

I'd say 75-85% of the gains were QQQ calls (mostly) and the occasional SPY call. Exceptions: I did OK while I stake was still small in July by focusing on the hype around MGM opening back up. And there was a marijuana-related stock (Grow-something) that had a ridiculously good day a few weeks ago -- I got in in the a.m. for a grand or so and did well. I was out the following morning.

There are no credit/debit spreads, no Iron Condors, no selling calls and puts to others and no real LEAPs other than a couple of experiments that didn't pan out early on. Some would say I lack imagination.

Therefor TQQQ drops to 40, 60% loss.Day 2: QQQ rises to 100 again! 25% gain! Therefor TQQQ rises to 70, 75% gain.

QQQ didn't change in the end, but in TQQQ you lost 30% of your value.

Suppose QQQ drops 33% in one day. TQQQ is now completely worthless.

On the other hand, when the market is stable and has a string of small percentage increases every day, TQQQ skyrockets.

How has it worked out over time? Well, TQQQ seems to be volatile, and still follow a trajectory of 10x every 5 years.

presser today was with Kayleigh, he always sends her out when the market is red and he doesn't want to show his face

he could pump on sun/mon but if he pumps I think it will be a test or vaccine, which I  think would be a catalyst for a rotation into cyclicals, and further tech exodus

195,2020-09-04,The fact that I sold everything Wednesday at the close and then jumped back in when QQQ was -1.5% yesterday morning is devastating,Jarreddit15,wallstreetbets,195.0
196,2020-09-04,"Started out with around $5k, got lucky on some SPY puts in March and doubled my money. It was all downhill from there but I did learn a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently put some more capital in the account and made some money on tech calls. Then lost 50% (30k) in one day on CHWY, DOCU, MDB, RKT etc. The market crash didn’t help. Sold everything and converted 100% of it into various puts (qqq, spy, tsla, amzn, aapl) as a YOLO.

&amp;#x200B;

Woke up today (04Sep) to see the account markets open flat and my portfolio in red. I said fuck my life...and went back to sleep. I was totally numb on the loss because it is just numbers in an app. Woke up a little later to see my account up 102% to 62K. Literally woke up at the right moment. Thank God for that.

&amp;#x200B;

Took a moment to come to my sense and sold around half at that time (at least I have learned to take profits). While I was selling it I saw the numbers fall from 65k-&gt;50k, literally in around 10-15 minutes. I use the robinhood website to it takes forever to do anything.

&amp;#x200B;

I was hoping for a further mid-day fall like it happened yesterday. I kept looking the the 5min charts to see a downtrend but it looked like tech was gaining and SPY was going flat. I said fuck it and liquidated the rest of my positions, don’t want to risk it.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t know if I can take the anxiety anymore. Going to be all cash until tue/wed and see what happens, hopefully wont FOMO. 

&amp;#x200B;

I will also be changing my strategy. I have almost ALWAYS lost money reading WSB (where opinions, memes and anecdotes pass as DD), so I am going to do my own DD (AKA follow my gut) from now on. I will also (try to...) refrain from betting on earnings and buying bi-weeklies. I will probably never buy an option with more than a 50cent spread again.

For all the bullshit rationalizations and supposed ""deep digging"" or ""analysis"" I do must confront the fact that I am a glorified gambler acting only on gut instinct and at best I am a pilot fish eating the scraps the market mover sharks leave for me while riding their wake

after the shitshow thursday and friday I am left with an overwhelming feeling like I can no longer read the tea leaves, or to use the previous analogy the direction the sharks are going to turn, there was a lot of thrashing and frothing and indecisive  directionless energy, and more importantly NERVOUS energy that my gut hasn't felt since MAYBE june but not even then

I think we have all made some great profits and some of the call holders on WED/THUR got reamed hard but we are definitely addicted and lack impulse control if after that shitshow we are loading up on positions one way or another for next week. My instinct is telling me to let the dust settle and be a lame boomer before doing anything, ride currents not pull the trigger on make or break calls at a pivotal moment where its literally just betting red or black on a roulette wheel.

So if Tuesday opens green, the puts will be down ~40% at open, no big deal I sell them and let the calls ride. If Tuesday opens red, you day trade more puts to make money on both sides.

82,2020-09-06,"I mean obviously revenue matters (see HTZ). But with tech you have certain catalysts propping that market up. Cloud computing and online shopping are going bananas since everyone is staying at home. Online streamers are seeing record subscribers. Many top companies are realizing their workforce could've worked from home and reduced costs all along. 

There are certainly some companies and individuals who are not taking as many risks because of the crisis. Ford just laid off over 1000 salaried workers. Cruise lines are still pushing dates back. AMC theatres are still empty. 


But I think there are a good deal who see the actions of the fed and the federal government as guarantees. Hey, take those risks, we're rigging the table to be heavily in the black. This trickles down to retail, as they watch a fire sale on stocks proceeded by ATHs. After all, if the government is going to guarantee my payroll, why not invest? After all, if the government is just going to give me $1200, why not invest in Apple? All the idiots on WSB are posting 1000% gains after all.  I think a lot of people underestimate how much retail has gotten into the game with all this free time and desperation. 

Look. I'm not saying the market is behaving rationally. I'm just pointing out how people get caught up in narratives backed by some kernels of truth. I think if you're trying to find a logical reason behind every move you're forgetting (even for a moment) that markets are heavily influenced by the  psychology of the masses and that doesn't always make sense. There are trends, and some trends have patterns. This is one that has netted me some profit: when the fed decides to prop up the market, people are generally convinced it will work. When people think things will be ok, they buy, and self fulfill their own prophecy. And the cycle continues. Sometimes this is a line of thinking taken by individuals, sometimes a firm.

The key is realizing this is incredibly risky, and catching that wild wind in your sail may tear it. But, if you can use that headwind even for a moment, you might get out before the storm. If you look at QQQ chart leading up to Wednesday, you can see it start to go parabolic. That's always a clue to me. Head over to WSB, no bears, all full retards posting unrealized gains of several hundred percent. Time to bail. 

Yeah, that's a risk, and I dont always come out on top, but I've watched this market pump past rationality and stay on that path for weeks before correcting. I've just learned to read the room amd realize when we've all moved to the same side of the boat before it tips over. Buying into the tech bubble is obviously idiotic, it's just knowing when to take profit, not being too greedy, and getting the fuck out before it pops. The key is knowing you're in a bubble and acting accordingly, and not being a full fledged moron who thinks a stock that's going parabolic will just continue to rise another 30%.",thisguy092,wallstreetbets,82.0
83,2020-09-06,"I think short term we could see a drop in gold and silver because there's no stimulus coming and the fed's buying is already priced in. I think we'll see the dollar rally like it did after the march crash, but smaller.

I backed out at the last second of buying vix, but made a point not to buy more calls even though I wanted to.  Thursday, no major news....so yeah, probably just a mini correction.   Vix goes up, so puts are expensive and are sorta dumb.   Rule of thumb is wait 3 days before going long.  Trying to play up and down gets confusing.  I just stick to perma bull and buy dips.

Tech is ever evolving and is the future of man kind. Imagine how much we depended on tech 20 years ago vs now. Where do you think we'll be in 20, 30 or 40 years? Every industry which exists will eventually become ""techified"", other companies will start to stagnate.

If I hit a 10 bagger and have 100k in the gambling account overnight, I'll take 80k out to maintain the 10% rule.

You look for good bid/ask prices and then find a strike you think TQQQ or QQQ will not go back up to and sell that call.. then buy a call even further up above the strike you just sold.

So example,


- Sell 140 TQQQ call

- Buy $142 TQQQ call

That means you make money if TQQQ isn't above 140 by the expiration you sell and you can close at anytime before as well.

that is ThetaGang

295,2020-09-08,"That's kind of where I'm at with it. In a weird way I did make almost 100% because in March I started with $1,700. I had purchased mostly weird shit too like Ladder Capital, Capital One, Boeing, Royal Caribbean, Marriott, Apple, and Berk B. Basically all of it nearly doubled. From there I went to around $3,500 and that's when I added roughly $1,700 more (around June). This mostly when into ETF's like QQQ and ARKG. Things were good for a while but when this downturn started up I decided to walk away. So I did realize large gains on that initial March investment just sort of traded sideways on what happened from June forward. That being said, I had genuinely 0% wisdom. Just a shit head with a Robinhood account, quarantined and bored. I've grown to really love trading though and imagine that I will continue for the rest of my life. The fact I managed to play round 1 without getting the shit kicked out of me is pretty cool. Looking forward to redeploying the $5,000 I have now. Nice username by the way.

Edit:  I bought a QQQ 280/285c 9/11 and a QQQ 270/265p 9/11 to make a reverse iron condor. This is expecting a 10 point swing in either direction which is possible.

Negative gamma is great for huge directional plays so when we were ripping on the q’s tech like tsla was leading the way because MM kept buying shares as those calls went ITM, but negative gamma is a double edged sword as we saw with tsla (which had one of the highest relative negative gammas in qqq) when the correction happened. What would be interesting is seeing how the largest spx components fare vs spy for gamma exposure, if that’s what your post was saying. It may be good to: sell puts on stocks that have experienced the largest gamma reduction in negative territory. Why? The implied vol on these stocks is still high but most of the gamma that determines the ferocity of those previous moves has effectively dissipated, creating a situation where the stock won’t actually sell off with to the levels that IV is predicting.",veritasinvestments,wallstreetbets,1.0

It didn't close below it until July 24th and even then, it was a pretty bullish candle so you could've made a case to stay in for an extra day. Went back above it the following day.

Currently, price broke and closed below the 21ema on the 8th for the first time since July 24th, bounced and hit the 21ema at opening today before dropping back down. At this point, you'd wait until price gets back and closes above the 21ema to go long again.",webulltrade,wallstreetbets,1.0

56,2020-09-10,"Alright guys, I hate astrology as much as anyone here, but I think I have some actual DD— plus I’m fucking tired of losing money over the past three days from stupid decisions. 

If you look at the 50 day EMA and 20 day EMA on either the chart of QQQ or SPY (1 year timeframe),  you’ll see that the past three days they’ve been bounce between the two moving averages. Tuesday was the first time either QQQ or SPY dropped below and closed below the 20 day EMA since June, but it only lasted for three days then. Prior to that, they hadn’t dropped below it since the beginning of March. Daily volume and volatility are still high, and cyclicals aren’t performing; the market can break out either way at this point. 

I think it’s best to wait to make any real plays until we break and close out of the channel between the 50 day EMA and 20 day EMA... right now I’m just trying to day trade before I get into leaps/long positions.

I'm 25 and most of my friends haven't started, I only have 8 years on you where I invested very minimally due to little income, so don't be dismayed. I would just say as you probably learned with options, theres no get rich quick scheme. 20%/yr is possible during the good years, which has been obtainable in the last 5-10 years, but might not be in the future. So hamper your expectations a bit. But I'm holding roughly 40 tickers so not going to go through them all. But mostly indexs like SPY (SMP 500), QQQ (Nasdaq), VTI (total market index), VOOG (large cap growth), etc. As well as a few individual companies that I was lucky to get early, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, etc. Notice the most successful investors (Buffet, Dalio etc) buy and hold for the long term and don't screw around with gambles like options and timing the market.

11,2020-09-12,"The last few months have definitely been ez mode for the market. Just have a general bullish sentiment, buy the dip and reap the fat gains within a day or two.

Unfortunately it appears we're in choppy waters again. I'm still moderately bullish tho even with the speedy tech correction. But if they keep hitting support after support and blow thru magic lines and GEX flip points then it'll be prudent to shift your trading mindset vs fighting the trend.

This was pretty apparently in late April too when market shifted significantly to tech and I stubbornly didn't get with the program till May (just before my 5/18 puts completely expired worthless). Sure that few oof days in June spooked the market but again, buying the dips still worked out exceedingly well.

The narrative these days is basically quarantine/tech stock vs the rest and if SPY and IWM doesn't fade as hard as QQQ then the rotation is more apparent and if you *must* have money in the market then financials and other sectors may not be a bad idea to look at.

We're also near the next stages where various phase 3 trials catalyst will start showing up, so if you're risk inclined the usual players are worth a look: NVAX, MRNA, BNTX, AZN etc. (I'd personally avoid INO and GILD but that's just me).",freehouse_throwaway,wallstreetbets,11.0

162,2020-09-11,"So I’ve got a couple months of decent returns, which I’m pretty sure means I’ve figured everything out. Obviously I’ll quit my job and go yacht shopping later, but first lemme tell you what I’ve learned. Of course, y’all know this already, which is why every day is green. 

First, have a thesis. 

What is going to happen? Why? Where is the applicable country, market, sector, and company going, when, and why? 

I don’t mean you have to be some finance expert. The PhDs can’t figure out the market anyway, and we both know you’re here to be a degenerate gambler, not a math expert. But gamblers still have a thesis. If I go all in holding a 2 and 6 off suit, it’s because I believe the flop will be 3-4-5 and “don’t draw to an inside straight” needs some exceptions to prove the rule. 

For example, a couple months ago, my thesis was that MREITs were a bit oversold, and oil had to go up because a hippy told me they stopped making more. Or something. 

That worked out great, briefly, then it didn’t. Turns out it’s tough for a company to come back after all their assets get called away. Who knew? Which brings me to my next points. 

Don’t “yolo.” Diversify. Hold some cash. Yes, I know, this isn’t r/investing and you’re here to gamble your life savings. Great. But again, in Vegas you don’t go all in the second you see your hole card. You play slots a few coins at a time; you can’t shove a first full of Benjamins into the slot. Or maybe you can these days, but you still have to pull the handle a bunch of times. Taking the high risk, high volatility positions required to feed an endorphin addiction means big losses on those rare occasions when the market is too dumb to realize your thesis was right. Expect it. Not everyone is as gifted as you. Plan to give the market multiple chances to accept your genius. That means having two exit points for each position, before you open it. One for how much you will make, one for how much you’ll lose. 

Have several theses. Not just “Tesla will go up because it did yesterday” but something about how they will save the planet and you learned from Batman that hero work makes you rich. You know, not just THAT Tesla will always go up, but WHY.  And a “why” for your “when” too.  And then another thesis on something totally different. And maybe a third. Take at least three different positions that are not too closely tied to each other’s success. When your account is big enough, make that five. Then ten. Your brilliance knows no bounds, so why confine it to one sector? But ten is probably about the max you’ll have time to keep up with between all the shopping trips for new mansions and super cars, so maybe stop there. 

Next, as we all learned in remedial fifth grade last year, a thesis is the scientific method has to be falsifiable. Just like you exit a position at a predetermined point, know what will proves your thesis wrong. Double down to a certain point, then fold and go play poker because blackjack isn’t your game today. 

A few practical tips for options:

Understand theta. Even if they are your enemy, learn how theta gang makes their money. Sometimes the market needs time to accept that you’re right, remember? I buy options with 45-60 days left. I sell covered options with &lt;5 days. This keeps me, not theta neutral, but closer. I also buy leaps, which are often really cheap, comparatively. 

Current thesis #1: somebody will get a vaccine approved by early next year, and make a bunch of money. Positions: small Feb-April 2021 call positions on MRK, INO, MRNA, CODX, and a bigger one on NVAX. Together, these are about a quarter of my gambling account. Exiting them all after a couple vaccines are approved by any company, though I may keep some MRK long term. 

Current thesis #2: people are sick of COVID. The economy will reopen and once we’re past the election no one will accept serious discussions another shutdown. Positions: Jan- June calls on X, MOS, DOW, and CAT. These are about a third of my gambling account, and I’ll probably roll them forward in a couple months. 

Current thesis #3: the market, particularly tech, was overbought. The pullback terrified or bankrupted the yoloers. The democrats will continue to block any stimulus until after the election, while their media buddies scream that the sky is falling. So it’s kang gang for a couple months, maybe with an upward bias because most things are gradually improving. So I sold my QQQ calls at 295, bought puts at 299, sold some of the puts at 280 and the rest at 275, bought calls at 271, sold them at 280, bought puts at 282, which I’m debating selling today. All have been roughly atm, 45-60 days out, and 5-10% of my account when I open them. I open with a double down point and a stop loss in mind if it goes against me, and a sell half and sell all for if it goes my way.

I also have been making a nice profit wheeling PLUG with about 15% of my account, and I sold a NKLA 18 September $32 put for $5 this morning because that premium is nuts and I’m willing to buy a hundred shares in a week for $27 net.",Obsidian-Thain,wallstreetbets,162.0

Looks like a pretty powerful wedge consolidation (if that is the right term) that has literally 1-2 days left before we get a powerful move in one direction or another. Does that seem reasonable?

Sure I agree that Tesla goes down more when it does go down, but the chances it goes down is less than QQQ (although the chances for both isn't that high to begin with).

Basically I'm saying if you start a strategy of buying weekly OTM puts, your ROI will be higher by buying QQQ puts than Tesla puts (both might be negative but the QQQ should be better). Now yes if you knew somehow Tesla was going down with 100% certainty, then buying Tesla puts is actually better since when it does go down it goes down more. But you don't know the latter part so just sticking to a weekly put buying strategy is better for QQQ &gt; Tesla, even though both I think are negative in the long run.

The chance of you making less than 7% returns average annually in a diversified portfolio are moot, never pay off sub 4% interest debt fast. Literally throwing away almost a million dollars over 30 years over investing what you would have paid the house off faster with instead. Seriously, do not do this. Save that money instead and put it in low risk 10% return shit like spy, qqq, fang, whatever floats your boat.

but here's the catch: if the orange man comes back fully recovered the situation will reverse because he will brag about how he conquered corona and it's just a flu so his legion of retards will go back to a false sense of security and all get infected again

Then early on in the crash, I thought we were going to go lower. Bought some QQQ puts on that. Lost all of that money.

ARWR calls. Also lost almost all of that.

Dollar bleeding out is also good for equities as it has peeled back most of September's gains and there seems to be a sticking point in the 93.5 dxy range that triggers large foreign inflows.

Today i became acquainted with qqq fd calls. the volume is so high on those calls that you can buy 50 and sell 50 in a heartbeat... its really easy to ride the wave on indexes imo cuz the moves aren't elevators up or down (besides just now lol). I was buying 50 qqq calls for like 12k and make like hundreds in seconds. It was so fun. Almost got caught holding 50 while the dip happened tho lol. I did get caught holding 10 puts I got at the bottom and closed 10 mins later for -1k but given how i usually play and lose in these situations, this is a success!

What do we know? Dems will likely win this election and are dying to spend a fortune that will be monetized by the Fed.

Yes the economy is in shambles and there are structural problems that we cannot fix. But we've learned that these people can kick the can down the road for much longer than you'd think. Mortgage forbearances, PPP ""loans"", student loan forbearances, COVID deferments, stimulus checks, eviction bans, etc. While all this debt is racking up, they will drown the markets in liquidity because that's all they know how to do.

Huge asset bubble coming. The more COVID, the more government tit. Equities will be the only investment with any return. The money will come off the sidelines. People will think it's a new paradigm with money printing. There will be no stopping it. QQQ and SPY to 500 by April.

6,2020-10-11,"yeah ive played with the idea in my head in opening up a tight spread on S&amp;P or something like TQQQ/QQQ, or a MEME stock that is going to go up for awhile (pton?), that is 1 strike OTM, 100 dollar pay out, 50 dollar buy in, total of 1K entry, re-roll with winnings, with expiration at 1-3 months, maybe vary it. so maybe 20% at the 1 month mark, 30% at the 2 month mark, last at the 3 month mark, open up a new 3 month spread when your 1 month spreads are ITM on exp.


Similar to what OP is talking about, but you have the ability to utilize time on your side if things arent going well. If the market looks bad, just stretch it out more, theta doesnt have to work against you.

Markets too volatile right now though, last time i tried to get this off the ground, September happened, and with the election; guh. Im waiting until after COVID, and the election bullshit to test this idea out.

I have a similar idea, but its a reverse condor, but you pick a direction, and upscale it. So essentially, you will buy 2 bull spreads just barely OTM, and buy 1 bear spread just OTM. If the stock goes down, your put spread will cover the buy in for your bull, if you go up, your ROI will be 50%. 50% consistent returns on a small movement is pretty good. The losing scenario of both spreads closing out at 0 situation is if the stock literally doesnt move one strike between open of the spreads.

Its essentially a straddle, reverse iron condor, and box spread had a kid, but picked a direction. Hedge out all the greeks but delta, and down-scale the leverage so its easier to profit. I might paper trade this idea for awhile.",Agitated-Bike,wallstreetbets,6.0

1. **Basic Theta Gang Spreads: Put/Call credit spreads and Iron Condors**

**Pros:** With the above strategies you can usually attain a high probability of profit and back test all of them through paper trading or options analyzers as long as you do some basic TA and avoid certain fundamental factors such as earnings and scheduled dilutions of shares.

**Cons:** While you can set up most spreads to have a high probability of profit, the higher probability of profit often leads to less reward and higher capital needed to use as collateral so if you overleverage and something wrong happens you can literally wipe out your entire portfolio. I've had this happen and keep in mind that even if the aforementioned strategy has a 92% probability of profit, nothing in life a guaranteed.

2.    **Index ETF** **LEAPS**

 If you've ever heard one of your boomer relatives who knows maybe one or two things about investing say something a long the lines of ""Time in the market beats timing the market"" this kind of takes that concept and pumps it full of steroids.

**Pros:** Over enough the time, stocks only go up here in the U.S so theoretically if you pick up LEAPS on an index etf such as SPY and QQQ, as long as you buy them far far out and make sure the strike isn't insanely OTM, the contract will yield a profit at some point over time and you can always roll them if you aren't satisfied.

**Cons:** If there is a flash crash caused by some global factor such as COVID or a world leader tweeting something you can get stuck bagholding for a long time and this is why you buy the dip to try and shorten that. Another con is that liquidity can get very very thin the further out the exp and the further OTM the contract you're trying to pick up is so making sure you get a good fill and don't overpay for your contract is pretty important.",gherna67,wallstreetbets,23.0

9,2020-10-13,So I just watch them every day. For now they’re trending down but as we near the end of October that could change. Watch the daily candles and you’ll start to see a bullish formation. Then you know it’s time to pull the trigger. Small bumps between now and then won’t make you rich but might get you some lunch money.  In the meantime SQQQ calls are good for when TECH / Nasdaq is trending down as SQQQ goes inverse of QQQ / TQQQ and UVXY the same for SPY.

Seriously, this is coming from a person who has 80% of my money in the market locked into long term ETF's, 10% stocks, and 10% LEAPs which most of WSB would say is boomer shit.

I go on /r/investing and it makes my brain hemorrhage, they are the most risk adverse people in the market. Just today I saw suggestions to stay cash (while DXY continues to drill), keep a 30% bond hedge (worthless), and that you should go 100% VT (the worst performing Vanguard market ETF) because the average retail investor can't beat the market over time. 

Meanwhile I'm up 95% on the year mostly off SPY and QQQ LEAPs I set back towards the end of April, and I have consistently beat the market for the last decade because only complete retards lose money in this environment.

If you’re asking me what I’m thinking, I’m going with waking up tomorrow- seeing where we are before open., And possibly buying calls if there’s a good dip, but I’m determining that on if the dip is consistent or not. If shit keeps dropping them a couple puts would be a good call, but you might as well buy calls for SQQQ because that’s basically shorting SPY.

So tomorrow I’d go with a blend of puts for TQQQ-QQQ-SPY, and calls for SQQQ. But that could change by the morning.

Rebalancing between QQQ and ZROZ long term forces you to buy low and sell high and greatly reduces draw downs with a little bit of loss of total return.  When QQQ was falling last month sold some ZROZ then to buy some more QQQ.  Learning how to sell at least a little bit of what's rocketing is hard but pays off in the long run.  In then end buying ZROZ cheap now will in a round about way allow me to buy more QQQ later when price is a bit cheaper.  The edge to this system is it requires zero timing of the market.  Pretty confident can pull down at least 12% and probably more like 15% CAGR long term without having to diamond hand that much (I think even black swan won't be over 20%).  That doubles your money about every 5 years or so.  Not sexy but risk is very acceptable imo.  The key is ZROZ and QQQ are pretty strongly negatively correlated but not totally like say an inverse fund would be.

It's clear that SPCE doesnt give a fuck about its investors or it's stock price. I think this is actually a good thing. They are focused on sending people to space safely and being cost effective, not share price or marketing. There's been so many delays because they know it's smarter to take their time and get it right rather than to rush and have a flight fail. When they do finally get these test flights done and have a successful flight, I think its going to generate an unbelievable amount of hype and it's all anyone on here will be talking about. I could see the stock price doubling within a week or two of a successful launch. Yall are really gonna underestimate this and then try to buy calls at the last minute. I've been holding shares for months and will continue to hold probably for the next year or so.

Yall really dont have vision at all. You have people on here investing in dead end crap like gamestop, peleton, QQQ (whatever tf that even is). And then the same old crap; TSLA, AAPL, MSFT... like any of those still have major steam left in them. Everyone knows about these stocks already. You arent going to see TSLA go up 1000% in the next 5 years. But SPCE very well could. The average person knows about all of these companies. The average person does not know about SPCE.

16,2020-11-01,"Well prediction time: futures will melt up to about 1 or 1.5% until Europe opens, at which point we'll gradually sell off until we're at about .5% entering pre market.  Open will be absolutely bullish with QQQ up like 2% before we slide back down to around 1% before power hour at which point I have no fucking clue but if I had to bet my life I'd say we finish about .5% up tmr.  

Not what the bulls will be looking for after last week and last month but perhaps good enough to get out from some of your tech calls before the election on Tuesday where anything other than a biden landslide will have us in free fall.

Be careful playing the volatility plays.  It's already elevated AF and a Biden landslide will take it back down 30-40%.  If you're betting on a contested election good luck.  Not a play I'm going to make, seems too obvious and something that MM have already priced in given market wide volatility end of last week.

It is intended to always go down. Nobody buys and holds this stock. Why? Because overall the market goes up and so the inverse of that would be always go down, especially when it is leveraged. 

It exists as a stock for hedging short term or trying to capitalize on the market performing poorly. Calls on SQQQ are basically puts on QQQ. 

It shows up when you look for VIX stocks but there are no stocks that are directly tied to VIX, this is just an approximation of that. The market could be highly volatile but go up and SQQQ will go down.

That play has allot open volume still and interest. If you got in on Monday that call was around 2k it’s already back to 3k. 
If you ply nio Idk I just suggest to buy shares. My opinion. The short term lotto plays have popped. But there is allot hype so I think the bulls will push nio to 100$ by x mas maybe. Idk that optimistic 

Right now my positions are 85$ amd call nov 20th nothing but loss. Bought at the top and bag held 

Apple 120$ call 6/18/2021 this is little more of a conservative play. 

I got SPY Jan 2021 400$ call bought at the top bag held my whole position.

23,2020-11-07,"Well it should be. But again your math is not proper.

7.19 / 2.68 = 2.68 and 3 - 2.68 = .32. .32 / 3 = ~.11

So you somehow lost 11% of what you expected. Yes, of course, the leverage worked out and you made more on the (effectively a derivative) of leveraged version which makes total sense but you also are missing some cash.

The question is whether or not this ""missing cash"" degrades further out you go. So if you took TQQQ from 2010 (I think that is when it started, or 2009) and did the same math YoY are you missing more than this 11% in the last 5 years? And if you are where is going?

As with all leveraged elements there likely will never be a true convergence between TQQQ and QQQ but the levered version, if it decays, only has so much life so you can't go long 20 years into TQQQ and expect the same market beat of 2.68 today.",Everyman_B,wallstreetbets,23.0

28,2020-11-07,"Since you really seem to be asking let me explain it to you.  It's called mean averaging.  So these things go up or down 3x the daily percentage of their respective markets.  To make this example simple, I'll use a made up group of two ETFs.  They both start at $100 and I get the 1x one and you get the 3x one.  Okay, first day the maket goes up 10%.  So mine goes up the same and is at $110, but yours goes up 30% and is at $130.  You're doing great guy, hang in there!  Day two, market goes down 8%, so I'm down to $101.20 since 8% of $110 is $8.80.  You drop 24% down to $98.80 since 24% of $130 is $31.20.  You see the problem?  The market is up $1.20, and I'm up $1.20, but even though you're getting 3x daily, you're actually down $1.20.

23,2020-11-11,"Unless it's an isolated event (like say an isolated AAPL earnings or some good Amazon news), the index usually is the first component that factors into each individual stocks price. It's true it's a cause and effect and you can ask which comes first. But the reason the index matters more is notional amount traded on SPX/NDX and SPY/QQQ is huge and most passive funds are only trading the index or ETF. Thus on a day like today, where QQQ is down, most of the big tech names making it up are down (MSFT, FB, AMZN, TSLA, Apple actually did well but followed a similar intraday pattern to QQQ and somewhat SPY). 

It's not that algos/funds decided to sell each individual tech stock which then drives down QQQ but rather MM/algos/institutions/hedge funds/small amount of retail sold SPY/QQQ (or bought a lot of puts on these - causing options MM to delta hedge by selling shares) and then by doing that, ETF MM have to then also sell these tech names individually as a result to keep the portfolio balanced since there's a direct mathematical formula. Like if you were a fund and you wanted to sell tech, it's clearly much cheaper to just sell the index than go through name by name. 

But this breaks for individual names on a lot of days too with individual events. I'm not even saying Tesla is that correlated but it definitely has some correlation. A name like Microsoft would have an even stronger correlation.",infinitelimits00,wallstreetbets,23.0

Always watch $SPY $QQQ $VIX when trading large caps either day trade or swing trade
Real money  is made on Trend Days
On Chop/Sideways days you have to be patient.

38,2020-11-12,"I don't like shilling, so I'm going to delete this asap. Comment below so I know it's read.

First things first: buy-and-holding ETFs is generally a much more reliable and lucrative plan vs picking individual stocks. I don't know if a portfolio of these companies below would outperform QQQ over a 20 year horizon. 

I'm sure some of these will be obvious but here's what's in my portfolio / on my watchlist:

**Companies broken down roughly by industry:**

NVDA / AMD / QCOM

AMZN / SHOP (AMZN under or around \~$3,000 and SHOP \~$900 should be solid long term)

SQ

FDX / ODFL

COST

BYND (I'm a BUY ranking around $100-$115 and probably a HOLD over \~$120)

SE / BABA / TCEHY (China's recent antitrust laws for big tech may not bode well for these, will probably divest soon)

EQIX &amp; SPG (would wait for a bit for SPG to fall further during a second wave of lockdowns)

DAL (if theres a dip due to further covid closures. Under $30 is good, under $25 is great, was able to pick up a bunch under $20 earlier this year and would definitely double down if it hits $20 again).

F (the electric F-150 looks promising, and I imagine there's upside here if they have success with it and this is a bit of a Rivian play)

Also everyone here has been writing about NIO and XPEV. I'm in these, but I don't know if they're worth getting into at the current pricing and with China's current tech-space regulatory concerns.

 

**ETFs:**

WCLD

KWEB (same china note applies here too)

ARK's Active ETFs (especially ARKG)

BOTZ 

WUGI (super thinly traded ETF but I use this for exposure to a bunch of the companies listed here)

&amp;#x200B;

**SPACs without targets near NAV:**

Butt Plug is different from the rest of these players. Including Tesla. They’re doing some really fucking cool shit with equipment and UAV’s. But the larger market doesn’t really understand the implications of fuel cells, namely in that they can be “recharged” way faster than batteries. Also, they can charge batteries, too. So it’s a complimentary technology, not just competing. Pile in that Plug now owns a vertical hydrogen supply chain and you’ve got a recipe for a moon shot in the next couple years.

Do some googling on why you shouldn’t hold 3x for very long. There’s more to it than can be written here. TLDR, just stay away from them. 

I would recommend keeping your hedges at around 45 days. You can also google “options as hedges” for more info. 

Overall, I wouldn’t let hedging drive you crazy. Just use it as a tool when you’re in a position that could potentially permanently wipe you out. If you’re in shares and diversified in proven long term positions (not meme stocks) you can weather just about anything.",blackoutut,wallstreetbets,31.0

I’m glad to see someone in your position using that kind of ETF strategy mixing LEAPs and shares - I have recently been realizing the benefits of that kind of strategy and moving that direction myself. With the ability to take on as much leverage as you are comfortable with using options, I don’t see much of a reason to voluntarily introduce additional variance into the equation with individual stocks. There are of course some exceptions there with companies that you really feel passionate about or have specialized knowledge on but by and large, I think a strategy based primarily on SPY/QQQ is by far the best you can adopt.

16,2020-12-12,"Pretty crazy day, but weekly OPEX still found a way to pin us to 366. We're pretty much back to Dec 1. It got pretty scary in the morning, but we found support and bounced off the 20 day MA. Still, the upward trend has been broken, and if we retest, I would stay out until a direction is formed. It gets pretty ugly if we go under it, especially below 360.

Next week might get interesting. It's monthly OPEX so normally things would be even more pinned down, but we have some major potential moves that could unwind a lot of Call Gamma. Tesla inclusion means other stocks need to be weighted down. I would keep an eye on Apple. VOL traders are still expecting it to be suppressed for the rest of the month, but VIX is curling up, and this might be the last chance for a big spike before the holidays.

If we get a vaccine or stimulus pump on Monday morning, I would wait to see if it holds, and would most likely try shorting it depending on how high we get. I would not try to long any index funds that expire this year. High chance of limited upside, but the low chance of big downside.  I think long individual stocks and short SPY/QQQ as a hedge for tail risk would be the better play.",bundleofsticks6969,wallstreetbets,16.0

All emotion and like macro-economic headlines.  I usually do 3% OTM (i.e., QQQ price now times 1.03 = my new strike).  If I think 3% is likely (stimmy, vaccine, etc.) then I'll sell 5% OTM.  I really don't want to get assigned, just cuz I'm lazy and don't want to ""run the wheel"" with CSPs.

🎶Memories, Light the corners of my mind. 
Misty watercolor memories, Of the way we were

Scattered pictures, Of the smiles we left behind. 
Smiles we gave to one another, For the way we were

Can it be that it was all so simple then, 
Or has time rewritten every line. 
If we had the chance to do it all again, 
Tell me, would we?

Could we?🎶",CobraKalls,wallstreetbets,3.0

If you’re at all paranoid about more correction in the next couple weeks but still bullish overall, just hedge your shit with really short term OTM spy/qqq puts and/or vxx calls.

17,2020-12-12,"I took a few too many geltabs this week and had a vision of the future.

Instead of deciding to move from CA to Texas, people will decide whether to live with Google or Apple or Tesla. Corporations will compete to provide better and better lives for their customer-citizens. Even people who do nothing all day will be monetized. Facebook will be able to offer housing and make more off the data they get from people then those people could ever make working. They will reach tech and capital levels that allow them to monetize people better than people ever could themselves. Look at costs for space travel under NASA vs under SpaceX and you can see that gov'ts are just impeding our growth.

The government is a protection racket slowing the transition to corporatocracy, but one day we will reach such exponential levels of growth that it won't matter. Companies will compete for citizens like countries do. I can't see how this isn't inevitable, given enough time. It will start with free housing being monetized for data and then turn into some sort of cyberpunk matrix type future, where we are merely consumer batteries to help power the machines of capital. Investors will have so much capital that they will fall over themselves to give more and more away to retain consumers. The free market provides a fabulous future and we slowly extract the power from the sun with a Dyson sphere and then move on to the next star, likely without being impeded by our biology any longer.

18,2020-12-12,"I have a thesis on timing QQQ. The entire tech sector is overvalued, but that's because people have nowhere else to put their money. I'm betting that this will stop as soon as the economy comes back up, which is looking closer and closer by the day. When all those closed businesses reopen, and the bankrupted ones reapply for loans, and people are out buying gas, plane tickets, vacation packages again (which will be enormous, imagine blowing a load you've been edging for 12 months), fundamentals will come back into play. At that time the tech sector will get fucked by the outflow and puts will print.

[https://github.com/brndnmtthws/thetagang](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/thetagang)

Hey WSB,

Not sure if this is WSB appropriate because it isn't YOLO material, but I thought I'd share anyways because people in the other trading subs liked it. Maybe some of you will eventually realize it's better to have money than not have money. I also like to share the good word and collect GitHub stars which I'm sure will be worth something some day.

S'anyway, I wanted to automate one strategy for my main buy and hold account, and after a lot of messing about with various brokers/APIs I settled on IBKR for a variety of reasons. I decided to release the work I did as an open source project (you can maybe tell from my GitHub profile that I've been building software for a while, and I make things open source when I can).

I wanted to solve these problems:

* automate trading as much as possible to remove emotional mistakes/issues
* work with broad market index funds, like SPY/QQQ/VTI/TLT/BND/whatever rather than individual stocks (I prefer not to mess with stocks unless I am o.k. with losing money)
* provide more consistent returns while clipping some of the short term gains (we do this through covered calls)
* taking advantage of the historical profitability of writing puts instead of buying the underlying (check out [this paper](https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/indices/documents/pap-assetconsultinggroup-cboe-feb2012.pdf))

This strategy is based on something called ""The Wheel"", which is useful when you a) want to own the underlying stock or ETF and 2) want to harvest from the volatility along the way. It's a somewhat passive strategy (compared to trying to guess uppies vs downies), which is my preferred way of investing.

I won't go into a ton of detail here on why this works (or rather: IF it works), but you can check out content on YouTube or wherever to learn about 30 delta covered calls, 30 delta BuyWrite indices, theta decay, so on. From that you draw your own conclusions, and decide whether it's the right risk/reward profile.

# Example Usage

You really need to read the project README to get a better sense of how to use it, but if you REALLY want to start quick you can run it with docker (you'll still need to create `thetagang.toml`, the config for the bot, and `config.ini` for IBC, samples of which can both be found in the project):

    $ docker run --rm -it \
         -v ~/ibc:/ibc \
         brndnmtthws/thetagang:latest \
         --config /ibc/thetagang.toml

I'll be around for a little while to take questions but if you don't make me feel cute I might delete later.",whirl-pool,wallstreetbets,19.0
