0,2018-05-01,"Okay let’s do some simple math. 

The price of AAA games was set at $60 right around the launch of HD consoles (think ps3/Xbox360) this was in 2005. That price hasn’t changed since, but the value of the US dollar has. 

The rate of inflation has averaged out at about 2% per year over the last decade. 2018-2005 = 13 years. 

2% a year x 13 years = an increase of 26% since 2005, hell let’s call that an even 25% increase in the cost of goods due to inflation alone. 

25% of $60 = $15. And $60 + $15 = $75

Video games today should be $75 JUST to keep up with inflation alone. ",1alex12me2,wallstreetbets,0.0

2,2018-06-04,"I think the big arguments for ULED over OLED are short-sighted: 
1. OLED still has a catalyst as it rolls out it’s blue LEDs (currently only red and green pixels are OLED, but blue will come).
2. OLED screens are extremely power efficient, and will be even more so when the blue rolls out. This is a major consideration for phone manufacturers who want to balance battery life with phone power.
3. The cost of OLED will come down as Samsung and LG scale production. Numerous factories are under construction to increase volume. Apple’s announcements validates that there is demand for the product. Aside from Hisense, not sure who is making ULED.
4. The difference in quality hasn’t been brought up as a major factor from the perspective of businesses because either is an improvement
5. OLED is being used for curved &amp; bendable screen technology, which seems to be the consensus for future screens. Not sure if this is true for ULED.

So if the power efficiency creates demand in the phone market, then that will bring down the price. If the price comes down, then TV companies will likely accept it as the next generation as well. Stock still has great upside as sentiment is gone while people wait &amp; see what happens with their financials.

Btw I’m not even saying OLED is really a superior product, but maybe this is a VHS vs. Beta or HD-DVD vs. BluRay battle, in which case I’ll bet on the product being adopted by Samsung, Apple, and LG. Despite the stock move to 200, it could still be early days for OLED, and buying at 100 seems de-risked.",Distraction86,wallstreetbets,2.0

If UPS strikes, AMZN is the start of your worries.  This would affect QVC, GPS, HD, LOW, etc, as well as important medical shipments like vaccines, medications, doctor office supplies, you name it.

In 4 short years she righted the ship, largely by having AMD advance their technology. I don't know all the details but 2 years later Polaris launched and they reclaimed the mid-tier GPU market. The next year Zen launched and for the first time in...oh 10 year an all AMD computer is a competitive powerhouse build instead of being a joke.

AMD has always been a technology leader...more than their more profitable peers. Hell they introduced:

* multicore CPUs 
* 64 bit processors
* GDDR5 
* HBM
* Multi-die CPUs

0,2018-09-03,"I only sell vertical spreads and my approach is to monitor each one independently. My strategy is probably too conservative for this subreddit for the most part, however it works for me. 

I usually aim for 20-30% profit and the resulting timeline varies from 3mo-12mo. Additionally, I only sell options far out of the money; generally put spreads no less than 10% below the current stock price, but I prefer 20%. 

Some stocks like HD have kind of stalled out, so my options haven’t moved much while still 8mo from exp. in this case I continue to hold

Others like AAPL, AMZN, V shot up and I was able to make 40-70% of my expected returns in just a month or so. When this happens I don’t get greedy and either roll them over or close the position. 

I almost never keep options until they expire, because there usually isn’t much profit left to be had on vertical spreads out of the money. 

Also, keep an eye on, what I call, ‘associated stock risk’ and make sure you don’t have an insane amount leveraged. Don’t forget that options that expire on Fridays and not executed until Monday at the bell, so if there is a large move over the weekend you can end up losing a ton of money.

0,2018-10-04,"Define server halls? If you're talking about data centers full of server racks, those particular racks usually contain Dell/HP rack servers or Supermicro's like these.

This is a Supermicro blade server, which goes into a blade chassis. The chassis itself can hold multiple blade servers ([https://www.supermicro.com/en/products/superblade/modules](https://www.supermicro.com/en/products/superblade/modules)), each blade containing it's own CPU/RAM/HD combo, usually two drives in RAID per blade.

At the data center I work at, these are usually single socket CPU blades with 32gb of RAM and two SSD's each in RAID1 for web hosting purposes. According to reports, the backdoor chip is inserted to grant full access over the BMC controller, which in effect gives full access to the server for remote system administration purposes.

The funny thing is, there have been various reports over the years regarding security vulnerabilities in BMC/IPMI configurations for Supermicro, Dell, etc. Dell &amp; HP in particular have used outdated firmware for years, and it's been rumored they bought the source code from the same third party.

But yeah, you have a valid point. These servers are literally *everywhere,* and most companies aren't just running one full chassis.. they're running multiple chassis' with multiple servers, and each server is usually setup with a dozen or so virtual machines. It's definitely a complex problem.
