5,2018-01-02,"He didn't buy ""48 calls of Netflix at 195"". 

He bought 48 Netflix 195 Calls with 1/19 expiration. He bought those calls when Netflix was at another value which was close to $277 per contract or the price of the option was about $2.77 (see his cost at $13,312.10/48 = $277, there's also the commission cost but will leave that at 0 for the sake of this exercise). Essentially OP bought $13k worth of netflix calls expecting the stock to be at or above $195 +$2.77 = $197.77 before January 19th. Not looking at the history of the option OP likely bought this outside of the money at $193 or so. Now the stock is at $200 and holds ~2 weeks of time value so the option is worth $200-$195 = $5 (if it were to expire today) + [$8.65 (price)-$5 (200-195) = $3.65 time value] = $8.65.

The calls hold more premium than let's say last week due to the stocks upward momentum. NFLX hadn't really gone over $190 except once prior to the bump on 12/28 + 12/29. 

OP is a lucky ballsy mother fucker and had what looks like 100% of his value in these crazy ass options.

Edit: Note a common misconception from noobs:  the stock does not NEED to be at $197.77 or above for OP to sell. OP can sell at any point even if it's out of the money. OP could even buy out of the money and sell out of the money (let's say he bought two weeks ago when the stock was at $185 for less than $1 per contract and sold at $193 for $2.50 per contract). As long as the time value/premium out paces the expiration date than OP can make money regardless.

It's easy gorilla math any monkey can do. ALWAYS lock in options gains. Always decide your out before you go in.   
.25 a call, if you double in a day, sell half. You have your $150 back. If it hits $1, sell another. Congrats, you have guaranteed a 66% gain. Ride dirty on the other two or get out at 500%. Selling 2 more contracts at 500% would have been $350 profit on a $150 play. That's a good day. Greed is always more expensive.   

Look at my NFLX trade from earlier this year, yes I sold at 280% gain that could have become a 500% gain (they topped at $95 a contract) but it isn't that I 'didn't make' another $30,000. It's that I did make $35,000. You can never look back at what 'could' have happened. Always decide your out strategy before you go in. Discipline and consistency are far more important than going 'TO THE MOON' on every trade. I also violated my own strategy on that trade because I was only supposed to sell half and wait.

 I don't see a way where Netflix can continue to grow earnings in a more competitive environment. They spend big money on originals to maintain their audience, not necessarily to grow it. If growth happens, it will definitely not be as explosive as past growth. Not even autists dispute that.

Further, competition is tough on Netflix. Let's take Amazon for example. Amazon doesn't have to operate Amazon video at a profit. I have no idea whether or not they do and I don't care because feelings are for homoerotics. Amazon simply have to operate Prime at a profit. The whole purpose of Amazon video isn't to bring in the big bucks, it is to bring people in and keep them in Prime. Amazon can multiply earnings with Prime nearly exponentially, since they can use it to bridge so many other things into their user experience which is essentially exactly how they've become the goliath they are today. Netflix is handicapped in this regard; it has nothing else to offer other than movies and tv shows and will have trouble finding new products to tie in.

* **Shares of the Chinese video service are up 90\% since its IPO in March.**
* **Baidu, China's largest search engine, owns an 59\% stake in the company.** 

The [Netflix](http://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/nflx-stock?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=referral) of China is continuing to rise in popularity among millennial investors.

It's gained 32 spots in the app's popularity ranking since last week, surpassing Dropbox, GM, and other more well\-known companies.

The surge, which was [first reported by Business Insider last week](http://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/netflix-of-china-iqiyi-hottest-stock-millennials-2018-5-1025999892?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=referral), mirrors a similar rise in share prices of the company, up 81&amp;#37; in the past month.

Ten\-year\-old iQiyi went public in March after being spun off by the Chinese search giant Baidu in an initial public offering that raised $2.25 billion for the video service. It currently boasts 61 million subscribers. For comparison, Netflix has more than 100 million worldwide, but Chinese regulations have hindered its expansion in the country.

IQiyi's post\-IPO surge — a 90&amp;#37; gain in the roughly three months since — has led to several bullish analyst notes in recent weeks.

The poster above you talks about the huge moat FB, AMZN, and NFLX have. That's all hindsight bias, as you've hinted at in your post. Everyone and their mom tried to make a social media company, and basically failed to gain any traction. Google tried (and failed) at least twice. Microsoft failed multiple times as well. Most of the winning social media companies are country centric. Russia has it's own and so does China, for example.

&gt;For whatever retarded reason, no TV companies, probably due to the prevailing corporate culture not caring about innovation, thought to invest in online services.

Hulu not withstanding, I imagine? Also, I think Hulu seriously screwed the pooch by adding in commercials. Amazon prime is interesting, but doesn't have the friendly UI/UX of Netflix or the integration with TV. 

The one part of your set of posts I do disagree with is 

&gt;And other, bigger, profitable companies take those ideas and slap their logos on them. FFS Tesla made all their plans publicly available.

Now - to be perfectly frank, I'm in no way in a position to drill in on the validity, but [this article](http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2017/05/11/tesla-battery-patents-elon-musks-duplicitous/id=81839/) and [this article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2014/06/16/what-tesla-stands-to-gain-from-sharing-its-patents/#316d4ec5665d) talk a little bit behind the strategy and requirements of using Tesla's technology. In general, [there is quite a bit of skepticism](https://business.financialpost.com/legal-post/tesla-motors-inc-patents-warning) regarding the open patent approach. 

I think it's pretty brilliant and does a lot to continue to cultivate Elon Musks' cult of personality persona that's driving a lot of the fervor behind him and his companies. The licensing of battery technology will be a constant win, especially if you believe that recent articles that say Tesla battery technology is at least 2 years ahead of the competition.

0,2018-07-04,"Only money as long as the market continues to climb. But you can hedge with shorter term OTM/cheap puts to prevent catastrophic loss if you feel uneasy but overall feel play is strong. 

If you are less certain you can get closer to the money puts (even same dollar amount you’d spend on far OTM, just less contracts) 1/3rd or half of duration of the long. 

That said, I believe exposure to 3 ER’s for NFLX with 1/19/19 expiry (sub 500 strikes) have high probability of success. 

Time left on contracts adds intrinsic value that doesn’t erode as quick as a negatively changing delta. 

More often than not they’ll do great on a well chosen stock and entry. Long dated doesn’t mean have to hold till expiry and just lets you have patience/no pressure on the search for optimal exits. 

Scalping FD’s can be really profitable is why people do. Potentially as much or moreso than longer dated position in matter of minutes or hours. I use RSI and Bollinger Bands (and eye on QQQ/rest of market + recent price action history) as my top indicators for a good entry on a scalp. Chart for ideas on mental stops. I like scalping and **not** swing trading them like many here. The swings can and do fuck people hard.

Will be a good year for NFLX. 

Expanding video game offering announcement should come sometime this year or next imo. They’ve got bang out awesome Originals in different languages (i.e Dark - A German show that has a Stranger Things vibe) that cause them to be household names. Invading countries entertainment-psyche’s , driving growth - spreading like a wonderful virus. 

Doing so they get more subs in those countries, in part due to lower sub cost international policy they have (to drive growth). **It’s like drug dealing. Start cheap. Get people hooked and spreading the word. Then raise the price when they’ve become more dependent.**

I remember NFLX started at +10% after earnings day but lost all of the gains by eod. Anyway, lets roll your gains into SQ.

I bought 12/21 85C but seems like it's going down tomorrow. However, they closed plus last time the day after the earnings even though it was down the day of the earnings report. If I were you, I would buy 12/21 80C at open if it is down. Although they missed on the guidance earnings, I think earnings for growth stock is not the biggest factor for investment.

* $RYAAY pilot strike put play
* $AAPL q2 earnings call - followed daddy Buffett
* $VMW call - heard a tip from a WSB thread and lost my money
* $DBX call - heard a tip from a WSB thread and lost my money

* $TGT q2 earnings play - was undervalued from my calc, mobile app and mobile site traffic was up a shit ton on some dd sites. Figured that their mobile presence would be the thing investors would be looking at in order to compete with $AMZN
* $FB q3 earnings call - lost 90% of my trade. RIP. still extremely bullish but sticking to stock only with this one for now
* $ZG long term put - been looking for a house and the company is shit with tough competitors + going into mortgages/flipping houses

Current play - $NFLX 3/15/19 $290.25 long term put - Overvalued, $DIS will eat it's lunch when it finally comes out. Business model is flawed because it doesn't have the infrastructure like Disney and other studios to pump out and compliment OC

Also, when purchasing calls/puts generally its a pretty good idea to do a spread.  Yes spreads cap your upside but they also prevent the bleed that is theta burn and you can make spreads pretty wide.  You're mostly in tech right now.  AAPL, SQ, AMZN(not tech but is priced as a crazy growth company), NFLX, ES(not tech but broadly correlated).  If you want to keep your portfolio the same and just control the risk then I'd sell some legs to turn all your calls into spreads and Id look at opening maybe one or two shorts.  You could look into a QQQ put as a hedge against your entire portfolio.  In order to give more suggestions I need to know your outlook.  I dont like giving blatant buy/sell advice because your account value is larger than mine, but I'm personally a bear.

I had fun buying the dip on QQQ during the summer. Sadly that strategy doesn’t work anymore since we’re in a massive tech sell off. Hard to forget how I lost all of my YTD gains in one day on Oct 10 bc all of my options play were QQQ and TQQQ.

1,2018-12-10,"Well I started trading in Feb of 2017, mostly MU. When I first got into options I played BIDU and AAOI. Was looking for stuff with momentum, but in all fairness it was a bull market. The big spike was an ER play, pure gamble, but was only 20% of my portfolio. The road to recovery is playing the trends. When we see get SPY rejected off the pivot... don’t stay in calls. That applies to most stocks, just read the chart. That makes it sound simple, but to go from a small account to thousands, you need a little bit of luck if you want to do it the fast route. Otm calls and puts and waiting for those big red and green days is the way to go. Last week, spy 270 puts were $1. They hit $500 during the big selloff. It’s looking for plays like those that can really get you off your feat quickly. I was down to around $1000 before I recovered. I swung some NFLX calls and made 400%. The chart looked nice and I saw a potential gap up and pulled the trigger. It’s difficult to find the big plays. Simple to make a quick 20-30% ",MightBePresident,wallstreetbets,1.0

6,2018-12-10,"I have come to realize that the majority of us  have absolutely no discipline whatsoever. Most of us are 20 something’s and will be able to recover from any losses in the future. This is not the end of the world for me. However, I am becoming increasingly concerned that the habits some of us have developed while we YOLO will carry on down the road. How many of you find yourself gambling online? How many of you tell yourself “just one more big trade.” This might just be me and I’m not trying to say I have wisdom beyond my years, but quite a few of us need a reality check. 

The big spike was NFLX puts on ER when they dropped 50 points, then I played calls as it went back up 30 the next day. The big drop was AMZN and SPY calls. I went from 56k to $970 in 2 trading days. The recovery was playing AAPL and AMZN to ATH. The drop was Elon smoking a joint on the Joe Rogan podcast. I had puts and sold for a loss the day before. Now I’m here... with $4.

I was so high on everything but, I realized I got way to greedy and held options way too long and took a some what big loss. Sitting back right now and just reading and watching. Looking for the next huge rise. I just got into the job market last year and nothing was ever this low. The companies I mentioned have so much cash and have such an edge on the market that I think once these political things playout will skyrocket once we have some global stability. I will def be waiting. All my January calls got ripped if. Things in March/July 2019 can return to somewhat normal levels. I should be able to alleviate some losses.
