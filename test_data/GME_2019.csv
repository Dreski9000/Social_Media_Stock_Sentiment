### Market Chatter: Apollo Global and Sycamore Partners Reportedly Bidding for GameStop

7:24 AM ET, 01/04/2019 - MT Newswires

07:24 AM EST, 01/04/2019 (MT Newswires) -- Stagnant sales and the popularity of digital gaming have forced GameStop (GME) to consider strategic alternatives, drawing interest from Apollo Global Management (APO) and Sycamore Partners, MarketWatch reported.

The video game retailer had $820 million in debt as of November, about half of which matures this year, according to the report. Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter also sees a decline in comparable sales from the previous year. Other analysts see a future for the company in e-sports.

Sources familiar with the negotiations told MarketWatch that a deal could be announced by mid-February.

I regressed GME over SPY for 1 year to get a beta of 2.0167. Equity multiple of 5.5% and a risk free rate of 2.73%. I added 1% for uncertainty risk regarding things going digital. So my equity cost discount rate was 14.82%

annual dividend will be 1.56, and they grow their dividend by .04 each year. so the incremental dividend is .04. 

(1.56/.1482)+((.04/.1482)/.1482)= $12.35

4,2019-04-11,"For cheap stocks like $GME or $BBBY maybe five contacts. I only do cash-secured so for something like $TSLA, $QQQ, or $NFLX just one.",Networking4Eyes,wallstreetbets,4.0
5,2019-04-11,"Sure thing!

My main earnings strategy is to sell far out of the money puts the day before the earnings release. The expiry I pick is the closest one to the day after earnings which will have the highest implied volatility. Implied volatility (IV) is very high right before an earnings release because the non-inside traders don't know if the stock will go up or down. It's a gamble. Some stocks are more volatile than others. Companies like $AMD or $TSLA are going to move huge while other companies like $JPM (tomorrow morning) may not move so much. The higher the IV the more money there is to be made. 

&amp;#x200B;

After the earnings release the IV drops an outstanding amount because everyone knows what has happened. This is what is referred to as ""IV crush"". For example, $BBBY had an IV of 129% before close 4/10/19 and dropped to \~50-70% on open today. You will recall from your Black-Scholes options mathematics that Vega is the relation of an options contract price to IV. Price goes up, IV goes up, price goes down, IV goes down. Basically, you can guarantee that every earnings release on every company will experience enormous IV crush. If you buy the calls or puts you're screwed by this no matter what direction you pick. If you sell a call or put you can capitalize on this IV crush by selling the contact when the premium is grossly inflated and buying it back cheap after the crush.

&amp;#x200B;

So why ""far OTM strikes""? This strategy is not foolproof. If you sell an ATM put and the stock shits (like $BBBY did today) the change in Delta (the relation of the underlying to the options contract price \[e.g. stock goes down, call price goes down, put price goes up; stock goes up, call price goes up, put price goes down\]) may cause you to lose money if the change in Delta is larger than the decrease in Vega. Remember that when you sell a put the worst case scenario is that your contact expires in the money and you are assigned and will own 100 shares per option contact on whatever stock you picked at the strike price you picked (although the stock price may drop much lower than whatever strike price you picked so you will own shares that are worth much less). If your contact expires out of the money you get to keep the premium you collected in full. The name of the game is to pick a strike that will not expire in the money. So look at how the stock moves during past earnings. $BBBY moves like 15-20%, so you need to pick a strike that can tolerate that movement and not be in the money. $LULU moves like 20% on earnings. If your strike is low enough you don't need to be too worried if the stock shits the bed 20%. 

&amp;#x200B;

When you sell puts the profit is capped so this is not yacht-making money. The return for the lower profits though is a higher probability of success which if you execute this strategy over and over again you will start to accumulate some nice wins and you can start to laugh at the people who buy calls and puts the day before earnings and lose their ass on the I V  C R U S H and that they picked the wrong direction. 

&amp;#x200B;

Below are some real trades I have made illustrating what I have described:

&amp;#x200B;

3/20/19: $MU sold to open 22 MAR 40p at 1.35 at 109% IV.

3/21/19: $MU bought to close 22 MAR 40p at 0.29 at 60% IV (1.06 profit). 

3/27/19: $LULU sold to open 29 MAR 130p at 1.62 at 135 IV.

3/28/19: $LULU bought to close 29 MAR 130p at 0.02 at 80% IV (1.60 profit).

4/2/19: $GME sold to open 12 APR 8.5p at 0.16 at 113% IV.

4/3/19: $GME bought to close 12 APR 8.5p at 0.13 at 65% IV. ($GME shit the bed. This one came close to not being profitable but it worked out for a tiny 0.03 profit).

4/10/19: $BBBY sold to open 18 APR 15p at 0.14 at 129% IV.

4/11/19: $BBBY bought to close 18 APR 15p at 0.04 at 70% IV. ($BBBY shit the bed too but the IV crush was massive too. Doesn't matter, 0.10 profit).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm all cash at the moment (aside from a small position in $REML) in preparation for $NFLX earnings on Tuesday. The 18 APR contacts are already around 69% IV and they usually trade around 35% (forecasting a 34% I V  C R U S H already!). You could sell the 18 APR 312.5p at 1.00 and tolerate a 15% drop in the stock after earnings. Not a bad buffer. After that we have $TWTR, $FB, $TSLA, $AMD, and $AAPL.

&amp;#x200B;

71,2019-06-04,"GameStop (NYSE: GME) reported Q1 EPS of $0.07, $0.10 better than the analyst estimate of ($0.03). Revenue for the quarter came in at $1.55 billion versus the consensus estimate of $1.64 billion.

Consolidated comparable store sales decrease of 10.3% (10.2% in the U.S. and 10.4% internationally).

George Sherman, GameStop’s chief executive officer said, “Since joining GameStop in April, I have been undertaking a thorough review of the business and working closely with the team to improve our operational and financial performance, address the challenges that have impacted our results, and execute both deliberately and with urgency. We believe we will transform the business and shape the strategy for the GameStop of the future. This will be driven by our go-forward leadership team that is now in place, a multi-year transformation effort underway, a commitment to focusing on the core elements of our business that are meaningful to our future, and a disciplined approach to capital allocation.”

On June 3, 2019, GameStop’s board of directors elected to eliminate the company’s quarterly dividend, effective immediately, in an effort to strengthen the company’s balance sheet and provide increased financial flexibility and optionality. Eliminating the company’s quarterly common stock dividend will preserve approximately $157 million in cash annually, based on the amount of dividends paid in 2018, and enable the company to further reduce its outstanding debt and provide flexibility to drive value creation for shareholders. As of June 3, 2019, the company has reduced the total amount outstanding on its 2021 unsecured notes by approximately $39 million, leaving $436 million outstanding.

GUIDANCE:

As previously announced on April 2, 2019, GameStop is currently implementing a cost-savings and operating profit improvement initiative designed to strengthen the organization for the future and support long-term improved financial performance and profitability. These initiatives, which include supply chain efficiencies, operational improvements, expense savings and pricing and promotion optimization, commenced during the first fiscal quarter of 2019. The company remains on track to achieve annualized operating profit improvements of approximately $100 million.

Obviously have to expand on this extensively, but I've reviewed its 10Ks, 10Qs, and other data today, and so far my short thesis is based on:  
\- Same-store sales growth of just 0.1%, seems like it's right at the tipping point of turning negative.  
\- 84% of revenue is from apparel, 99% of sales are in-store as opposed to e-commerce, it's unanimous that people are going to shop online more and more over time as opposed to in-store.  
\- They're expanding the number of stores which seems like a huge waste of capital and that they're overextending themselves.  
\- Key point that Burlington management (remember, old physical retail guys) is missing is that they don't see that we're still in the ""Early Majority"" phase of e-commerce; the majority of lower middle to low income shoppers (Burlington's target demographic) are predictably lagging behind on adoption of e-commerce, just like they lag behind on literally everything. For example, when smartphones got popular, lower middle to low income shoppers still had flip phones for a few years, now they all have smartphones. Same thing is already happening with making purchases online, it just hasn't made the biggest impact on that income level yet, but it has already made a massive impact on retailers like J.C. Penney who have a middle income customer demographic.   
\- Similar trend to GME in that buying games online was weird a few years ago, now it's becoming normal, except that trend moved faster because again, its customer demographic is middle income. Overhead of physical retail stores is expensive, physically going to retail stores is inconvenient (unless they offer some amazing experience which Burlington doesn't), and Burlington is completely undifferentiated compared to competitors.",CanadaCanadaCanada99,wallstreetbets,27.0

&gt;  
&gt;they aren't creating a loyal customer base.

People have been saying this for years.  I remember when GameStop was able to buyout Electronics Boutique.  EB was loved and GameStop was loathed so people couldn't understand why GameStop was able to purchase the ""better company"", but the GameStop policy of ripping off customers was much more lucrative than EBs policy of fair deals.  The ""buy for $10 sell for $50"" strategy has been their bread and butter for decades.

The bigger problem is, as you mentioned, digital downloads.  People who hated GameStop didn't have a choice but to buy from gamestop because they were the only game in town.  They bought out all of the competition and, up until Best Buy started selling games, they were the only option for most people to get games.

The main reason they were able to hold on through the Xbox360 and PS3 era when steam started taking off was because consoles still required the purchase of physical media.  Sure things like GameFly would cut into their business a bit, but they were still the number one source for getting physical copies of console games. 

It wasn't until the Xbox One / PS4 era started that digital downloads became as easy to obtain for consoles as the physical copy of the game.  Once that happened the decline of GME slowly started.  They are mostly floated by people who believe they have to have a physical or people who do not have/do not want credit/debit cards.",desturel,wallstreetbets,23.0

Not only is market sentiment at an all time low, they're still FCF positive.  Major div ETFs had to drop them.  Everyone holding for divs dropped them.  Losses hurt twice as much as a gain feels good so - those emotional people dropped them.  

They did show improvements in collectibles.   New consoles are coming.  E-sports is interesting but probably useless endeavor.  They still have pivots they can make.  

I think poor management has gotten them behind the times in data analytics.  They should be into board games by now.

In store they can make some money through these events (while making sales with all of the new foot traffic), and online they could be *the* go-to online retailer for all things gaming (not just video games).

41,2019-06-06,"Here's the thing.  Gamestop's business model just CAN'T compete with the alternatives.

Anyone can order that same console from Amazon, for the same price or cheaper.   
 The only way that Gamestop is going to be able to compete with Amazon on price, is if they're taking a loss on the sale (ostensibly to try and reinforce their customer base and increase foot traffic).

And they can buy it without having to drive to a store that may or may not have it in stock when you get there.

Gamestop's only way to compete is by buying and selling pre-owned games (something that Amazon and other internet retailers don't touch).  However, that's a double edged sword:  When the store buys four games from someone for 1/4th of the price that they sell it for, *they aren't creating a loyal customer base.*  The customer feels like they've been ripped off.  That effect really can't be understated.  It creates an adversarial relationship between the customer and the business.  And a business's relationship with their customers will make or break them.

On top of that, the pre-owned market is becoming less and less feasible.  

1. Digital downloads of AAA games are commonplace, and that chips away at a huge source of revenue.  (Again, do customers want to drive to a store that may or may not have a hot new release in stock?)  
2. And then there is DLC (non-transferrable).  
3. There are multiplayer accounts, that are attached to a game's serial number / CD key (in the PC market).
4. And then there's the massive number of titles that don't even try to be distributed through retail channels.  Huge ""indie"" hits.  IF they even go for a retail release, that only happens *after* they've already been released, and many customers have already purchased that title.

Gamestop's business model is irreparably fucked.  I don't know what you see in them.

In addition to this, the abundance high profile titles which will release this year are still a long while off (in the October-November range) and these sales will most likely go to digital outlet stores such as the PS store or Amazon. What do you think about the comments I've made here I'm interested to see your point of view because it seems you are a believe of GME.

11,2019-06-11,"When I sell puts before earnings I like to have a nice buffer in place in case the stock drops dramatically after the release. I usually look back a few years to see the the percentage moves after an earnings release to estimate the expected volatility. Over the last two years the biggest after-earnings move on $LULU was on March 27. It moved 15%. That move was up but it could just have easily been down. You could use that as the window of volatility to expect. You would want to budget at least a 15% drop (so around the $145 strike based on today's prices). Of course, rogue waves happen and even though I was priced in for a 20% move on $GME the stock dropped 40% and I still lost thousands. The lesson here is that the method is not absolute and past events do not predict future occurrences; although these moves are relatively rare.

I always sell my puts cash-secured, so I hold the cash in a money market account with Fidelity to buy the shares at the strike if assigned.

3,2019-09-06,"expiry at least a month out, run calculations on optionsprofitcalculator to check different strikes. I put some thought into potential macro events as well as past SPY movement trends as well.

I have cut some for losses I have had made mistakes, but none that cost me too much. Sold most for small to moderate gains, and had huge gains due to headlines Wednesday night (holding calls).

Review of my thoughts since last thurs: Bought some puts on thurs at 289 because we were trading under the 289 resistance. Resistance broke on friday and bought puts again at 292. Tariffs expected over the 3-day weekend, figured conciliatory gestures from china made the market reduce the price-in from tariffs so I expected a drop. Market bull more than I expected, and even with headlines going my way drop was not as big as I expected. Took okay gains on the 292 puts on the morning dip, and when the big dip started I underestimated the drop and sold my 289 puts for a loss. Small loss overall, could've been a decent win with better timing but seeing the bull market almost tank through the weekend headlines made me want to drop the puts.

Picked up calls to head into wednesday expecting some bounce back. Was rewarded with a peak in the morning, sold my calls. After a small dip, bought back in. Yuan fix was bullish on tuesday night, and my read into china/trump made me expect the trade meeting to be rescheduled in the coming weeks.

Wednesday night everything goes my way. My read cashes in way sooner than expected, combined with some other shit, and I walk away with 200% gains on my calls.

I sell my calls right after the peak thursday morning and buy in again at low 298. Not necessarily expecting bull tomorrow, but after resistance broke at 293/294 I think there is strong upside, and if a dip we will revisit 298 in the next week anyways. Meh read, and bought in too early as SPY bleeds half a point during the day. Double down on calls at EOD for same reasons. Friday I just watch the market and make no plays, annoyed that IV crush has actually cost me a lot more on my calls than I anticipated and wondering if I should cash out in order to play the 298.5 resistance I think could dominate next week. Instead I end up holding hoping for a push to 300, and randomly FD a stupid amount on GME puts for no reason other than autism.

22,2019-09-08,"This could go a number of ways fellow degenerates, Remember – Q2 is never good for Gamestop and is typically when the lease amount of money is to be made. I think their stock price will be impacted by the following fundamentals / rumors.

**Bulls Looking For:**

1. Substantial increase in gross profit %

They’ve been trying to increase it via less promotions (29.7 to 30.4 YoY change in last quarter) and this would prolong their business further if it is substantial enough

2. Further reduction of SG&amp;A above $100m announced last quarter

If GME decides to close half of their stores during the rumored “Phase 3” plan to revitalize GME – but this seems to be more a long-term play as they apparently have a lot of leases with 2ish years on the books still

3. Share buy back – the Burry bull thesis

But....GME can’t purchase any shares until 48 hours after earnings release. Even if they announce this it could fall on deaf ears because they have in the past failed to utilize what they have already authorized to repurchase shares. It’s possible this would not have any impact until after a tender is completed.

4. A substantial increase in sales of collectibles (their only growing area), offsetting a smaller than expected decrease in used game sales (they had a \~20% YoY decrease (100m) in pre-owned sales last quarter)

5. A stabilization of their comparable store sales – like a 5% decrease instead of the 10% YoY decrease in Q1.

6. They look to go private again given a more favorable interest rate environment and lower stock price. Think either someone trying to vertically integrate (EA – two wrongs make a right?) or a vampire hedge fund looking to make a quick buck.

**Bears Looking for:**

1. Management to do nothing – hanging on as long as they can with a strategy the market hates and not returning any cash to the shareholders (pretty much giving the finger to Burry)
2. An accelerating decrease in comparable store sales (greater than 10%+)
3. Decrease in YoY gross profit % (even with the SG&amp;A reductions)
4. Any acquisition that burns their cash and doesn’t actually mean anything strategically

It seems that the market is not pricing in a lot of hope for GME and have only begun to recently price in Burry’s bull thesis (and holding onto those gains). If the bulls wins we could see a short squeeze of epic proportions in the next few weeks as the short float is something stupid like 60%.

In the long run I think the bears will get the best of GME, but the next few months of trading for GME should be fun for both sides. Even if there is a short squeeze we could see some extreme volatility after the squeeze is done.",Chanash,wallstreetbets,22.0
23,2019-09-08,"No one thinks this is a good business. Everyone knows it is a bad business. But they think that the balance sheet is strong enough that GME could hypothetically buy back 80% of their outstanding shares with existing cash and cause a short squeeze on the 60%+ short interest causing the shares to moon. It is not being priced as a bad business, however. It is being priced as a SHIT business. If you buy a bad business for the price of a shit business, you can make a good amount of money. 

I own 10/18/19 $5 and $6 calls for this exact reason. Management was not able to buy back shares in the past few weeks because they entered their quiet period. Ideally, they'll start buying back that 80% of the outstanding shares the day after reporting earnings.",MikeThePutz,wallstreetbets,23.0

25,2019-09-08,"Would you mind expanding on how operating a retail store in the current environment and closing stores isn't a bearish sign? I know people here are screaming puts on them and inversing WSB isn't always a bad play, but I'm trying to see the bullish case for them. 

Yes, there are physical discs in the current video game systems and likely in the next generation of consoles, but you can buy games on Amazon and have them same/next day for free. You can also order them online through Target or Walmart and pick them up, on top of your normal grocery shopping. None of those companies are dependent upon video game revenue to keep the doors open. 

But what about the used game market? There are plenty of online options to buy and sell used games, Facebook's marketplace comes to mind immediately as I've sold games there at a higher price than I'd get from trading them in at a Gamestop. I can buy games there as well, so the need for Gamestop is easily replaced by a social media platform. 

If the rumors are true that they're going to close 2k stores, sure, it'll lower their operating costs but what are they going to do with the stores? 

From their K: *We regularly assess stores for closure that are not meeting performance standards or stores at the end of their lease terms with the intent of transferring sales to other nearby locations. We believe that we can ultimately increase profitability by successfully transferring customers and sales to other stores by marketing directly to the PowerUp Rewards members who have shopped in the stores that we plan to close. ****If we are unsuccessful in marketing to customers of the stores that we plan to close or in transferring sales to nearby stores, our results of operations could be negatively impacted****.* Meaning they lease all that real estate, at least Sears owned their locations and could've turned it into a REIT, GME doesn't have that option. Their solution to slumping sales is to close stores and force customers to drive further? If there's a Walmart/Target/Best Buy between that old store and the one the customer has to go to is going to get their business. 

I think the market will take them closing unprofitable stores as a sign that they're going to be around a little longer, but their revenues are going to tank unless they manage to transfer 100% of their customers to the remaining stores. I'm not sure they can position themselves as something other than a retail store. If I was going to spend Friday night doing tabletop games or Friday Night Magic, I'm not going to expect a Gamestop location to be the place to go.",SarcasticPanda,wallstreetbets,25.0

13,2019-09-11,"My basic understand of IV is that it signifies the potential swing of stock on any given number of factors. For example, earnings are considered volatile events, because if ABC misses, the stock could tank. If ABC beats, it could moon. The earnings make the stock price potentially volatile. 

GME was especially volatile because of all the speculation around it. People knew it was a shit company but then the Big Short guy bought a huge stake and said it’s not that big of a shit company. Stock price could’ve swung big %s in either direction based off earnings, which is considered highly volatile.

The more IV an options contract has, the more value it has. The high IV of the contract implies that if the necessary swing happens in favor of your call or put, it could very well put it ITM.

When events end, like earnings, the IV drops off a cliff, because there’s not any more known potentially volatile events soon to happen. If the IV of your GME put was 100%, you will lose a lot of that IV tomorrow morning at open and your contract will lose a lot of its value, unless you are ITM.

If company x is worth $4 and you buy the stock. 2 years later company goes bankrupt but you got $6 in special dividends then you win.

I might just play a really small strangle so I profit either way since I expect it to tank or fly. More on the tank side though. /r/teabagsonfire told me to check out Camelot331 and he says they're closing 80 stores in December alone which would be bad news for the price. However, they are estimated to lose .90 per share so if they could manage to lose .60 and raise guidance with the shady tactics they are pulling we could see a huge rally before the fall to bankruptcy.

3,2019-12-10,"GME always seems to disappoint, either on EPS or revenue. They stopped issuing guidance, so they make you wait for the bad news.  As of today GME is up 24% or 38% since last earnings (depending if 09/10 or 09/11 closing price is used) and up 97% since it's closing low in August. That tells me there's higher expectation going into this earnings report. GME is no stranger to huge short interest, but it seems to be at a record high. The question for me is if management is turning things around.

Notable events over the last quarter:  
Insider buying by 5 directors in Sep (and insider ownership has increased this year)  
Sale of Simply Mac to Cool Holdings  
Chief Accounting Officer stepped down &amp; replaced  
Announced gradual closure of 300 stores in the Nordic region during 2020  
Announced closure of 180-200 underperforming stores across the globe by the end of the fiscal year

So, it seems that management is acting on their turnaround plan, hence their runup in price since Aug. But, not everyone believes they are succeeding, hence the huge short interest. What does it mean for Wed? I dunno.",ennagizer,wallstreetbets,3.0

You short the stock (that means you borrow shares from a shareholder and instantly sell them giving you $10$) because you feel it’s going to drop soon. You borrow the $10 (plus interest and holding costs, commission, whatever your broker charges). 


Now the stock drops to $5 so you have the opportunity to buy it at a cheaper price and pocket the difference ($10-$5-fees = profit). But what happens when almost 80% of the stock has been shorted? Well then you, and everyone else is competing to buy back shares at that $5 price. Supply and demand says that if there’s not enough supply to meet the demand, prices rise. In short, a short squeeze happens and everyone trying to cover their positions fights for it.

Also their new CEO, has been restructuring heavily, they laid off 14% of their corporate staff, as well as many other costs. They have also optimized their storefronts and already have closed the ones that are underperforming.

The $GME store had 5 customers in it at 9:30am with 3 employees.

The Macy's ($M) store at 4 customers in it including me with 5 employees and about 8x more retail space than $GME had.

On top of this I have seen that $GME is cutting back their corporate staffing to more appropriate levels given their cash generation.

$GME may beat earnings expectations given my expert customer counting skills.

I think they may raise guidance and put out a turnaround/restructuring plan in the near future. What saved the $GME equivalent in other countries was a transformation into essentially gaming Cafés with weekly/monthly tournaments that happen to sell peripherals for consoles for the plebs that aren't r/PCmasterrace as well as those bobblehead doll things.

 That statistic certainly seems very telling for the current extrapolated future of $GME, although there will probably be short term trading volatility surrounding the buyback + high short interest as the business deteriorates.

Wonder if there are any data that shows breakdown of console sales, because the bull case is heavily weighted towards the console refresh cycle. Seems pretty easy to buy new consoles online.",burrym,wallstreetbets,1.0
2,2019-12-12,"*Looks up GME stock ticker*

Oh.... Oh boy....

Um... Yeah, that's ... I'm....

Yeah.",oneisnotprime,wallstreetbets,2.0
3,2019-12-12,"I am not so sure that the console refresh will be that effective in slowing the decline.  Margin on hardware is incredibly small for both manufacturers and retailers.  Same goes for brand new software.  

The much higher margin portion of the business is in pre-owned which is getting eroded with digital downloads.  Yes people will still want physical copies but the bigger issue is the shortening of the pricing cycle.  

It used to be that because retailers held massive amount of physical copies, pricing on games stayed relatively high after release.  However with so much of the distribution channels moving to digital this cycle is significantly shorter.  Used to be a AAA title would hold at full price for 6 months to a year.  This allowed for a large window  for GME to gain value in the resale market as the gap between full retail and what they paid for games in trade was so large.  However, now when Sony decides to drop a AAA game from $60 to $40 on the play store GameStop eats that drop directly out of profits.  

Hardware in FY 2016 was 1.4b in sales and resulted in $154 in profit.  Hardware in FY 2018 was 1.7b in sales and only $150m in profit.  

Contrast this to preowned which in 2018 was $1.8b in sales with $810m in profit.  

The earnings call from yesterday talked about a 13% decline in preowned sales.  2nd quarter had preowned declining 17.5% year over year.  

Looking at their assets, they currently have 3.145b in assets and of that 1286.7b is merchandise.  They carry preowned games on a cost basis from what they paid for them.  Which means there might be a serious disconnect in that 1286.7b.  Some of this is likely already priced in as they went from 1.8b in merchandise to 1.3bish from last Nov to this Feb.  

All of that being stated current shareholder equity is $617m on 82.1m shares which is likely whereabouts that $8 number is coming from.  So even if that $1286.7 is just 15% high you lose $190m in shareholder equity which puts you down near 420m in equity with 82m shares outstanding which is a little over $5 a share.

Granted preowned only accounts for 22% of sales for FY2018 so it’s possible that it only represents 300m or so of that value.  In which case it’s only 40-50m of shareholder equity that might be off, which leaves you at $570m in equity or about $7 a share.  However at a rate of 400m a quarter to generate sales, that’s going to be tough sledding to generate that $7 in value.  It’s worth noting though that 2000 of the store leases are up this fiscal year so we may get announcements of massive closings in the next quarter which would drop that $400m considerably.

The other problem is they have been propping stock price with buy backs and with only $300m in cash and cash equivalents they won’t be able to do that anymore.  

They might make it the year but there’s also a real possibility the phrase going concern pops up before the next console cycle hits.  

TL: DR : Best of luck, but the math doesn’t make any sense for it to hit 8.  However with the amount of shorts in the market, you might end up making money off it anyway due to how the market works.",Senseisntsocommon,wallstreetbets,3.0

Personally, this situation is too complex to me - there are so many unknowns: 1. How material the refresh cycle will be for $GME vs. Competing distribution centers (this also appears to be a highly anticipated catalyst for the bulls); 2. How successful activists will be in initiating change, etc.

On the positive side, $GME  is heavily shorted, and with company buying back shares, this dynamic is temporarily beneficial for bulls. Not sure if buying back shares is a good use of capital, however.",burrym,wallstreetbets,5.0

2,2019-12-13,excellent! so now I can invest my $7.68 weekly savings into high quality stocks like hexo acb and gme.,chodmode2,wallstreetbets,2.0
3,2019-12-12,"I started option trading this week. Testing results:

My first option trade I made $50. Yay ( Could have made $300 with an investment of $300 if I wasn't hasty)

Then I got greedy. Down $80 now.

Somebody pull down GME to $5 so I can make money back.",DarthSimian,wallstreetbets,3.0
4,2019-12-12,Stack some bills to buy GME. Then cut them in half to buy half a share of GME. Your tendies will now be worth 25% of the original value.,chodmode2,wallstreetbets,4.0
5,2019-12-12,"Hey man. I got some GME calls. Plus, I just ordered Mortal Kombat 11 from them today. I wanna learn some new fatalities to apply to $MIK - since they pissed me off.",murderousmungo,wallstreetbets,5.0
6,2019-12-12,"Kinda feels like the pervasive negative sentiment is interfering with investors’ reasonable estimates of FCF, fair value, and the likelihood of reversion to fair value in the lead-up to the console refresh. I’m well aware of the challenges GME is up against, but I’ve yet to come across a legitimate bearish argument from a FCF perspective.",DeepFuckingValue,wallstreetbets,6.0
7,2019-12-12,"I think I'm gonna get my $fomo on for some 3/20 5.00C. Not many, but the corner is sure to be turned, and I do like the opening up of the markets in canada. 

Thought I had a free $40 or so floating in my tendies account, but I dont. All tied up until I sell GME (limit order in). Then I'll go play with ACB",murderousmungo,wallstreetbets,7.0

9,2019-12-12,"GME will be lucky to make it through 2020 without entering receivership.

You wanna know another company that’s up almost as much as GME? JCP! Look at that - doubled in the last month. That must mean it’s also a much better bet than any companies I mentioned right?

This is what happens with dying dumpster fire retailers",brutalpancake,wallstreetbets,9.0

11,2019-12-12,"Who cares what it’s done since 2018? What matters to me is what it does in 2020. Since August, GME is up more than all of those companies.",DeepFuckingValue,wallstreetbets,11.0

GME calls, AAPL puts, PCG puts, GRUB calls and F calls) and whichever one gets the most blood, buy.",AxelrodWins,wallstreetbets,14.0
