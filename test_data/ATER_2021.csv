0,2021-10-01,"I just dont see why the price would fall now. The share price falls if shares are sold. Shares are sold:

1. When the stock is shortened
2. When retailers and institutions sell

Why would the stock be shortened now ? It would take balls to short the stock now, when the company has just announced expected increased earnings, and only 4 weeks to ER which is expected to be positive. The market might tank - but why short this stock, when there are so many other stocks to short that did not just announce increased earnings news ? I just dont see it.

And why would retailers sell ? for profit taking ?..well that would allready have happened by now and again why do it, when only 4 weeks to ER with expected good results ? Again i just dont see it.

Paperhand bagholders ?..there are none left. All bagholders are out. GOGO is at ATH. Not like ATER which is being pumped right now, but a lot of bagholders who will bail out when/if the price goes up.

Only risk is a big hedgefund who allready shorted this, and will try to shorten more, to force the price down and force a sell off. But very risky, so close to ER.",Jetola,wallstreetbets,0.0
