AAPL, for all their current “headwinds” will still be generating a buttload of cash for the foreseeable future. $150b of net cash and Cook said that’s going to neutral. Either buyback another 15-20% of the company - or finally making a massive acquisition. ",timberlakers,wallstreetbets,0.0

5,2019-01-06,"No. Netflix can keep convincing subs to watch Blockbuster--plus everything that got rejected by real studios and they outbid or grabbed before Amazon--from their couch and continue to BMF throwing shit at the wall and hoping something sticks so they can grow their subs all day.

What I'm saying is Disney is going to bring all their content and IP home (shit people--and most importantly their squealing toddlers and emo teens--actually want to watch and also watch again) and host on their own webservice. 

With Iger at the helm (who's brain they better figure out how to turn into AI and just appt figureheads as the face of the CEO after he retires) they'll figure out how to bundle up all the Frozens, Avengers, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Daredevils, Hannah Montanas, Lion Kings, Star Wars et cetera, and layer them in and on packages with ESPN and Hulu to compete with Netflix, Cox, HBO, Sling, Prime, Dish, etc simultaneously.

Best part is Disney is the entertainment version of Amazon: they can subsidize the whole venture with profits from the parks. Use the webservice to cross brand themed experiences at the parks. Subs money will just be cause they can and to pay for the costs for infinite ROI. Ad dollars will be gloryhole grade icing on top.


You pull up a NFLX chart and look at their market cap....then pull up a Disney chart and add Netflix ON TOP of that shit.

Long $DIS if you want to be in on a reallife moonshot.

MAGAs will soon fight for cloud dominance. So, whichever gets MU first will get DRAM, NAND and XPoint at cost, which would be a huge advantage if/when memory cycles back. For MAG, this would also cut costs for their devices (and mitigate the issue of Samsung messing with inventories and jacking prices around on them).

15,2019-02-08,"Few quick questions and advice.

1) how long did it take when you made your first initial deposit until your funds were in your account? I deposited money 24 hrs ago and it seems like it wont clear til next week maybe monday?

2) how good are your fills about the same as your other broker?

3)do you use the desktop platform or the website platform? Both are pretty jumbled and not as easy as my Merrill lynch platform.

&amp;#x200B;

Advice I buy a lot of options and sometimes double down (buy another half my shares after I bought some before to average down price) I found that even though they say Commissions is capped at 10 bucks no matter how many contracts its kind of misleading. For 1 theres also an additional 20 cents per contract fee (THATS NOT THAT BAD THOUGH) but the part I don't like is say I buy 10 contracts of nflx now and the same day I want to average down and buy another 10 at the same strike same expriation all the same deal. You would then get charged another 10 bucks for just ""ADDING"" to your position. 

&amp;#x200B;

Example.

You could buy 20 contracts @ xyz strike for x expiration =  total commission of $12

but say you bought 10 contracts @xyz strike for x expiration, then you added 10 more to that same position that same day = total commission $24

&amp;#x200B;

Profitable companies buyback shares from major institutional investors selling their shares.  Those institutional investors used to have shares and now they have cash.  Those institutional investors either 1) directly invest in non-profitable startups like Uber/Lyft (or nonprofitable seasoned companies like NFLX/TSLA's debt), or 2) invest in nonprofitable startups by proxy (eg giving money to VCs and PEs) and those VCs/PEs invest in new companies.  This is called the 'capital cycle' and happens every day.

This matter b/c people that are aghast about companies buying back shares aren't smart/informed enough to see the TOTAL capital cycle and understand 'where' the money that UBER/LYFT/NFLX/TSLA are burning comes from.  Essentially, every share buyback is indirectly funding a non-profitable startup.

0,2019-03-09,"So I ran over the [Dark Pool buying](https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix?) + [Smart Money Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_money_index) thing I posted [about earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ayv9hm/weekend_discussion_thread_march_810_2019/ei3jky9/). Here's an update with Friday's information. 

My process is this: I look over the list Squeeze Metrics puts out for subscribers that lists unusual dark pool buying or selling activity. If I see a name pop up a couple of times, I cross reference it with the Smart Money Index to see if the broader market confirms. 

I also sometimes check out particular names I'm interested in that don't necessarily pop up on that ""unusual acitvity"" list. SAP was one such catch. Next time I'm going to try and keep my personal/subjective picks on a separate list. 

**Lots of Dark Pool Buying + SMI trending or reversing upwards:**

1. ABB 
2. AMZN
3. BCS
4. C
5. **DWDP** (was on my previous list)
6. IVZ
7. JNUG
8. **MO** (was on my previous list)
8. MOMO (earnings this week)
9. NEM
10. **SAP** (was on my previous list)
10. SOGO
11. SRPT
12. WFC
13. **XOM** (was on my previous list)

Changes from previous list:

- Dark pool buying volume or proportion of buying for FOXA, ITUB, LLY, NKTR, NTNX, ORCL, and TSM dropped off considerably Friday. 

- RIO had an increase in dark pool selling Friday, but Thursday was also its ex-dividend date, so that may have played a role. 

**Lots of Dark Pool Selling + SMI trending or reversing downwards:**

1. BGS
2. DFEN
3. DUST
4. INGN
5. PRS
6. PRA

Notes on this list:

- CQQQ and KWEB have appeared on the ""unusual selling"" list but SMI isn't showing a confirmation. Similarly, INDL (the 3x leveraged India Bull ETF), EWW (Mexico ETF) have all had unusual selling this week, and YINN (3x China bull ETF) and EEM (Emerging Markets ETF) popped up yesterday but again the SMI isn't clear.  

- TSLA likewise has seen heavy dark pool selling these past few days but isn't being confirmed by the SMI. It's notable that before Musk's big announcement about the cheaper model 3, they were however doing lots of buying.

- IAU (gold ETF) has been on the unusual selling list a lot, but SMI isn't confirming and it seems odd that there'd be buying of gold miners and selling of miner bear ETFs at the same time. 

**Broad Sector/Index Notes:**

1. SPY: Increased dark pool buying each of the last three days
2. QQQ: Increased

Other notes:

- Last week/early this week saw lots of selling of small caps and biotech. Friday though saw heavy buying of TNA, the 3x small cap bull etf. IWM and XBI also seem to be trending upwards in regards to proportion (but not aggregate volume) of buying:selling.

- Thursday saw lots of buying in FB and selling of SQQQ. Friday reversed that, with FB seeing lots of dark pool selling and QQQ and TQQQ getting sold. 

- FANG names are mixed. AMZN, BABA, NFLX seem strong. BIDU, FB, NVDA, TSLA, and TWTR seem weak. AAPL and GOOG flat/holding steady. ",FireSail,wallstreetbets,0.0

12,2019-04-11,"Sure thing!

My main earnings strategy is to sell far out of the money puts the day before the earnings release. The expiry I pick is the closest one to the day after earnings which will have the highest implied volatility. Implied volatility (IV) is very high right before an earnings release because the non-inside traders don't know if the stock will go up or down. It's a gamble. Some stocks are more volatile than others. Companies like $AMD or $TSLA are going to move huge while other companies like $JPM (tomorrow morning) may not move so much. The higher the IV the more money there is to be made. 

&amp;#x200B;

After the earnings release the IV drops an outstanding amount because everyone knows what has happened. This is what is referred to as ""IV crush"". For example, $BBBY had an IV of 129% before close 4/10/19 and dropped to \~50-70% on open today. You will recall from your Black-Scholes options mathematics that Vega is the relation of an options contract price to IV. Price goes up, IV goes up, price goes down, IV goes down. Basically, you can guarantee that every earnings release on every company will experience enormous IV crush. If you buy the calls or puts you're screwed by this no matter what direction you pick. If you sell a call or put you can capitalize on this IV crush by selling the contact when the premium is grossly inflated and buying it back cheap after the crush.

&amp;#x200B;

So why ""far OTM strikes""? This strategy is not foolproof. If you sell an ATM put and the stock shits (like $BBBY did today) the change in Delta (the relation of the underlying to the options contract price \[e.g. stock goes down, call price goes down, put price goes up; stock goes up, call price goes up, put price goes down\]) may cause you to lose money if the change in Delta is larger than the decrease in Vega. Remember that when you sell a put the worst case scenario is that your contact expires in the money and you are assigned and will own 100 shares per option contact on whatever stock you picked at the strike price you picked (although the stock price may drop much lower than whatever strike price you picked so you will own shares that are worth much less). If your contact expires out of the money you get to keep the premium you collected in full. The name of the game is to pick a strike that will not expire in the money. So look at how the stock moves during past earnings. $BBBY moves like 15-20%, so you need to pick a strike that can tolerate that movement and not be in the money. $LULU moves like 20% on earnings. If your strike is low enough you don't need to be too worried if the stock shits the bed 20%. 

&amp;#x200B;

When you sell puts the profit is capped so this is not yacht-making money. The return for the lower profits though is a higher probability of success which if you execute this strategy over and over again you will start to accumulate some nice wins and you can start to laugh at the people who buy calls and puts the day before earnings and lose their ass on the I V  C R U S H and that they picked the wrong direction. 

&amp;#x200B;

Below are some real trades I have made illustrating what I have described:

&amp;#x200B;

3/20/19: $MU sold to open 22 MAR 40p at 1.35 at 109% IV.

3/21/19: $MU bought to close 22 MAR 40p at 0.29 at 60% IV (1.06 profit). 

3/27/19: $LULU sold to open 29 MAR 130p at 1.62 at 135 IV.

3/28/19: $LULU bought to close 29 MAR 130p at 0.02 at 80% IV (1.60 profit).

4/2/19: $GME sold to open 12 APR 8.5p at 0.16 at 113% IV.

4/3/19: $GME bought to close 12 APR 8.5p at 0.13 at 65% IV. ($GME shit the bed. This one came close to not being profitable but it worked out for a tiny 0.03 profit).

4/10/19: $BBBY sold to open 18 APR 15p at 0.14 at 129% IV.

4/11/19: $BBBY bought to close 18 APR 15p at 0.04 at 70% IV. ($BBBY shit the bed too but the IV crush was massive too. Doesn't matter, 0.10 profit).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm all cash at the moment (aside from a small position in $REML) in preparation for $NFLX earnings on Tuesday. The 18 APR contacts are already around 69% IV and they usually trade around 35% (forecasting a 34% I V  C R U S H already!). You could sell the 18 APR 312.5p at 1.00 and tolerate a 15% drop in the stock after earnings. Not a bad buffer. After that we have $TWTR, $FB, $TSLA, $AMD, and $AAPL.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, in regard to this, I was just evaluating from a revenue standpoint. Personally, I don’t like Disney operating in this space because their core competencies do not include streaming. 

Between production, movies, theme parks, and merch, I think that they are spreading themselves too thin and are trying to become the Amazon of entertainment, which I’m not a fan of. From a perspective of business strategy, it would’ve been much more lucrative to strike up an exclusive streaming deal with NFLX or HULU for some absurd $/year amount, that way they aren’t dedicating their own resources to making this.

5,2019-05-03,"No no, I should have clarified.

Every one of those spreads is Jan 2021 expiry EXCEPT the 195/200 AAPL one.  That one is June 21/19, so next month.  That one I actually opened when AAPL fell from last year's ATH to around 200 and I held it through all the end of year craziness... almost closed it so many times, glad I didn't.  Got very lucky, risk averse way to handle it would have been to close it, but I must be kind of an autistic idiot if I'm here right?

The NFLX spread is 250/270 so that one is like laughing territory now.


Shorting VIX I do buy shorting VXXB, which is now renamed VXX.  I just sell em short.  Go on vixcentral.com , if that curve is steep up front you have an advantage being net short volatility.  I can explain that in a lot more detail if you're interested.",Fettywaap,wallstreetbets,5.0

7,2019-05-03,"Oh hey dude it's you!  Didn't look at the name until now.

The reason is because I don't really need the collateral, it hasn't constrained me vs any trade I've wanted to make at all.  This is my active account, which is linked to my passive account, and that account is much bigger and provides a lot of margin.  I (up until Wednesday) was using considerable margin shorting volatility (250% short maintainance requirement), and now I'm using that margin writing naked puts on high-IV stocks.  I was always doing that, but I'm doing it more now.  I think for me, right now, considering the use of cash going long and paying interest, I would rather be short puts, collecting cash, having theta on my side, and having directionally bullish trades... that *seems to be* the best use of margin to me right now.

The AMZN spreads are big - I have 4 bull spreads at 1700/1740 (was a little early on that one) and 2 at 1600/1640.  So 16K maintenance + 8K.  Credits collected there were bigger than FB, total $13K.

AAPL I have some nice ones, 25 160/165, 10 180/185, and 10 195/200 for June 2019 I'm glad I didn't panic close.

Good if you're an options seller but for buyers it's almost certainly net negative EV no matter what you do, because the underlying accounts for so many different movements and news exposures and barely respects support/resistance levels.

People are always asking on these threads because we are trying to squeeze blood from the streaming stone. I know more about film than is reasonably healthy so I tend to speak up. Here are two movies currently on NFLX that I love dearly that not nearly enough people have seen:

Layer Cake - Imagine Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels or Snatch but with the stylized comedic sensibilities cut out - you’ll have an idea of what you’re getting here. The directorial debut by Matthew Vaughn, one of the finer filmmakers working today, when I walked out of a screening of this film 10+ years ago I remember thinking to myself ‘Daniel Craig would be an amazing James Bond’. Just a really brilliant film, and don’t be afraid to throw on the subtitles due to some heavy accents.

Gone Baby, Gone - Ben Affleck’s directorial debut, starring his little brother and taking place in Boston. Everyone first saw Affleck as a director after The Town, but this movie was where he showed everyone he had the goods. A tight little crime/mystery/thriller movie that makes you wish Ben could find some peace in his personal life so he can go back to making films, he is really really great at it.",Flyers179,wallstreetbets,2.0

Luckily the last few days have been stellar for profits - I hope you've found the advice from the last few posts useful. Recommended options so far have been on point!

Again, plenty of opportunities to make $$$$$ on both sides. Bulls and bears can easily win in this market. Just a matter of timing your entries/exits right, picking some good stocks and being patient. Here are the stocks I'll be watching closely. Apologies if it's a bit rushed - I've got some deadlines to meet asap and the time dwindles.

**Stocks for the BULLISH crowd:**

* PYPL is a bullish power play rn. So is CRWD (can moon any second!)
* APPL and FB ain't looking too shabby if you're feeling bullish and want to play a FAANG. Keep an eye on TWTR, LK and XLNX as well
* SQ and ROKU should keep climbing up. Monster potential for SQ til the end of the week.
* If you want a longer dated call, ZEN and TWLO, and NYT won't let you down

**Stocks to play if you're feeling BEARISH:**

* COST, WMT, CMG, LYFT (Lyft puts only for a day or two... It should pick back up after)
* Bear power play: SFIX, NFLX
* TSLA. Very few reasons to be bullish, plenty to be bearish. If trading TSLA is your thing make sure you think twice before getting calls. Flip a coin 3 times, see if it lands on its side.

STAY AWAY FROM BA/CRM/BABA/SHOP (if you want your trades to be better than pure gambling). These are treacherous stocks atm.

Will try to check in later to answer any questions but will likely be busy until tomorrow morning.

7,2019-07-09,"Spotify (projected for 2019 numbers) Vs. Netflix (2018 numbers)

Spotify total users - ~250m total - ~122m premium users

Revenue - $7.37B

Operating loss -($313.88M)

so spotifys Revenue per user is roughly $30 per year. 

Their premium membership is $9.99 a month. So assuming a good amount of their premium memberships are discounted student ones or family pack, lets just say if even only 50% of their premium users pay $9.99 a month and the rest dont pay. That would put revenue at $7.31B. That does not include any revenue from their ads to the non premium members. 

How is their total revenue only $7.37B? There has go to be an insane amount of their premium users paying no where near the full premium membership. so their numbers really arent as good as they seem at first glance. They also operate at a $300M+ loss. 

Netflix 

Total users - 139 million (end of 2018)

Revenue - $15.79B

Net Income - $1.211B

So netflix total revenue for user per year is $113.60

netflix membership prices vary and price has gone up throughout the year, but the range is basically $7.99 - $10.99 for 2018. So their revenue per user is roughly 278% higher than spotifys. they also have increased their price for 2019 by 12%-18%. 

How is netflix making so much more per user while operating at such a lower cost? 

Market cap as of 7/9/2019

SPOT - 26.1B

NFLX - 164.45B

Netlfix is valued at 6.3x that of Spotify. 

Hulu gained more subscribers than netflix did for the 1q of 2019 while disney and others have launched their own streaming service. 

Is spotify a better long term buy assuming they will be able to lower their operating cost over time with not as much competition or rights/ownership issues of their content since the majority of their content isnt exclusive to their platform

idk if any of this even makes sense i just started typing and tying to put together all the numbers and just putting my thoughts down. Some of this could be not perfectly accurate as trying to calculate for user growth throughout the year and price fluctuations is near impossible . also, I do not know much about the market or how directly related market cap is to total company valuation since not the total ownership of the companies are on the market so depending on non traded shares value could change the value of the companies and completely throw off the market caps i was working from. Idk. who knows.

A few important lessons from this: Individual stocks have way more potential than major indexes, by a mile. My picks outperformed whatever play you could make on SPY/QQQ by a good factor. Even if you don't like/agree with my picks, I encourage y'all to pick 2 or 3 stocks you know well and play on those. Consider fundamentals, study them charts.

**Predictions made yesterday for today's trading day:**

**BULLISH:**

* Very bullish on Lyft. Beauty of a day for the stock, at  **+$2.04** **(3.41%)** I was bagholding and printed some solid tendies but chickened out and exited early.
* Bullish on ZS ( **+$0.52** **(0.62%)** ), OKTA ( **+$3.82** **(2.94%)**), TEAM ( **+$2.67** **(1.94%))**, Z (**+$1.33** **(2.72%)**)
* Also bullish on ROKU  **+$0.12** **(0.12%)** , Apple  **+$1.25** **(0.62%)** and LK (-$0.17 (-1.89%) )
* CRWD  **+$1.54** **(2.30%)** 

**BEARISH:**

Very bearish on Humana. Today **-$4.01** **(-1.52%)**

* Bearish on NFLX **+$3.77** **(1.00%)** and LULU.  **-$0.75** **(-0.40%)**
* TSLA (daily results don't matter. You can't be bullish here!)  **-$0.28** **(-0.12%)**

\-----------------------

Many of the stonks recommended yesterday were on fire! Let's see if the magic TA eight ball keeps it rollin. Again, individual stock plays seem a lot safer and potentially more lucrative. Check out the charts yourself and pick wisely :).

If bearish, I think the following are due for a bit of a drop that could print solid tendies on the daily:

* HUM might drop for a few days (and it's a good stock for swing trade IMO), but will continue it's uptrend and with the recent mention at Barron's and upgrades, it's a great addition to the portfolio
* NFLX, Illumina, LULU and Adobe are bear powerplays for the day
* If SHOP drops and you have a put, hold overnight
* Still very bearish on TSLA until earnings. After that it depends on guidance, and who knows with this company

If you're feeling bullish, wait for the drop and consider:

* CRWD calls will print tendies no matter what. There'll be some price manipulation but if you navigate the BS, it's a lucrative one
* ZS, OKTA, TEAM, Z, still tons of potential to go higher
* LYFT calls are a power play IMO
* ROKU is also a solid gamble. Will try to test ATH and even $120 this or next week
* LK and APPL should gap up soon, but you never know with these two

I'd also stay away from BA and CRM for now. Even BYND is an unreasonably expensive gamble.

Beware holding overnight unless you're feeling confident about whether we'll have a green/red day next.

&amp;gt;**Competition, content worry is noise, not a signal; Buy** We see most near term risks for Netflix as fleeting, with structural growth expected to hold. Competitive noise from Disney/HBO Max/Apple launch plans, content departures and potential for weak domestic subs amid price hikes could shake confidence briefly. The loss of “Friends” and “The Office” is not all bad as 1) the company can redeploy spending on originals, potentially slowing budget growth to the benefit of FCF, 2) we see the sitcom
genre as filler content rather than a key driver of signups, 3) all of the top ten most watched TV show seasons in 1Q were originals according to Netflix, cooling worry about content losses. We would see any dip around these worries as an enhanced buying opportunity because we do not see Disney/HBO as the competition and we expect, as has happened before, any price hike driven increase in churn to be short-lived as consumers come back for Netflix’s content.

By the way moron aside from the SPY puts these were not daytrades. Every one had the closest Friday expiration so time is actually very limited moron. Have to have enormous balls of steel to see your trade working on a Wednesday, be up 100% and not take it, knowing that it expires worthless on Friday. 

NFLX I bought $375 puts on Thursday when it was trading at $382.
WMT I bought iirc on a Friday (at their 52-day high iirc) for the following Friday. Sold it on Monday. 
JPM days from expiration.
SPY was the only daytrade and was quite lucky with Trump's tariff announcement. It was a Thursday trade expiring worthless the following day. When you pick a close expiration you can only give yourself 1-2 days for the trade to do what you want it to.

This isn't a misstep, and for all the talk of shutting down NFLX, the real short play are the cable companies who charge far more than $12.99 a month to give you shit you don't want. Couple with buying up all the IP that could be streamed and this is a threatening grab no one else is doing on this scale.

How do you drive the stock price up? Dominating the box office with record success didn’t do it. Outstanding ROI from Marvel and Star Wars didn’t do it. Now Disney possesses a ton of Fox material.

11,2019-09-06,"I think streaming is just going through the lifecycle of a new product/market.

NFLX had to prove concept and profitability before anyone else was willing to leave the cable and network TV contracts that they've negotiated for literally decades and commit resources to a new medium and monetization model.

But now that they have, it's moved onto the land grab stage, where everyone and their grandmother jumps in thinking it's easy and like printing money.

Great part is all of the competition will kick off natural selection and those without subs will die.

Personally, I don't see how anyone beats Disney. The focus right now is the model and market share, Disney has all of the content, and leveraging their presence, legacy time in the game, and capital (both of the human content generating variety *and* financial) to increase and solidify their moat.

They're buying entire companies (and competition) strictly  for IP. Getting IP laws rewritten to lengthen their control of said IP, and cleaning up Marvel's shitty legacy contracts to vigorously reclaim the IP they see as valuable that competitors have. Universal are the only mofos smart enough to see the steam roller coming and try to cockblock best they can.

None of DIS competitors have the infrastructure to readily extend their stream's reach with the movie. Add to that no one else can cross brand their streaming IP with the ride **and** the merch. Add to that, Disney has eyeballs from 6 months to nursing home glued and fed crossbrand marketing opportunities at every turn.

Last thought: what is every middle class well-to-do parent's default Apex family vacation? Now take a step back and think of how much of their life they've been fed that idea, and why they think it's ideal ""for the kids"".

Watch the fluctuation if you are down -15% (If 15% is a tiny loss for this particular volatile stock i.e nflx 288~ then hold and you should expect it to jump back to 296 it usually stays within this range.) then cut your loss or when you notice any particularly bad news.",viiiviiixci,wallstreetbets,6.0

8,2019-09-11,"So NFLX is barely profitable at +$10 per month subscription and Apple is going to start a new service for less than half the cost? While both companies compete and bid to buy movies and tv shows.

I think the growth assumptions in NFLX's price are now even more stupid crazy high. PE +100? lol. (even if they didn't lose subscribers to competition (big if) NFLX's stock price is pricing future price increases which are now much harder to do as they cost double the competition already). 

Also it seems very likely Apple's streaming service will run at a loss at $5 per month. Assuming they take growing and running this service seriously, I don't see how they are close to making the numbers work as is. Looking at NFLX for insight into costs at scale, NFLX has costs of ~$8 per subscriber per month, even if Apple eventually raises prices and can do some things more efficiently, this service seems like it's a cost not a source of profit for now. EVEN if they Apple reached NFLX size in a few years. NFLX only makes $1Billion a year, AAPL makes $55Billion...so maybe eventually if Apple can create and grow this service and raise prices and be more efficient they might add 2% to the bottom line? 

I have no position in DIS but they seem to be positioned best here. Though the stock isn't cheap even if they win the streaming wars 2020s...So I rubbed my crystal ball and the random trade generator says...

When I called, I bullied them into being able to keep my email account (personal gmail I’ve had for 12 years) instead of using a new email for an all new account, which she was saying was the only option.

It's a large component of their business, whether we like it or not (70 bil acquisition). I mean DIS was already expecting it to be bad (.35 off earnings but it ended up being .60).

I think the bad news is somewhat priced in and they are stuck in this lower channel until funds thinks otherwise - I'm only breaking even right now cuz I've been adding to position every time it drills to $129s and dumping at $132~$133s - but really a debit spread would have been the way to go or any theta position given this thing has been flat/bleeding non stop since last quarter.

Movies etc. doing well are priced in IMO. It's like ATVI releasing a big title in their franchise and it did well (MW pulling 600 million). That's one of their core businesses after all. Its what entertainment publishers do.

Things that will move DIS are things that market hasn't priced in (Verizon channel adding in tons of existing customer base), pre-numbers from subs showing incredible growth, additional unannounced partnership, other streaming services mentioning DIS+ affecting their growth (e.g. NFLX ER lifting DIS the next day).",freehouse_throwaway,wallstreetbets,2.0

Covered calls and box spreads have one thing in common: collecting *premium*. Chances are they’re looking at wsb and people’s trades and shutting them down quicker. So here are a few ways you can collect premium, other than covered calls:


1. Gut Iron Fly: Sell NFLX Dec 285 call, buy 290 call, buy 290 put, sell 290 put. Basically worth $5 plus the fly cost. You can definitely sell this at $5. Do it on a non dividend stock, easy to borrow and not too ITM on the put side, to prevent early assignment.


2. gut Iron condor: same thing but spread out the middle strikes.


3. Sell deep ITM put. Good way to get exercised on accident, so probably don’t do this.




Now, another way to invest your unearned cash: if you know that you aren’t paying interest on this money (double check that. I would assume, since your margin is a monthly fixed cost), why not just invest it in risk free stuff? Use a million dollars, buy 100 SPY shares, sell the Dec 13 (pre dividend) 300 Call, buy the 300 put. You’ll collect 1.something percent annualized. Most importantly if you do this, don’t tell wsb *yet*. Higher likelihood of RH finding out.


And as a disclaimer, doing any of this is a horrible idea. Good luck you magnificent pieces of shit.",SocioButt,wallstreetbets,2.0

Long run nflx costs are going to remain high and single pronged on rveneue while Disney will milk every content in like 4 different ways (attractions and other things too)

Then I remembered I was fairly new around here when the Ir0nyman stuff went down and there were grumpy WSB ""veterans"" complaining that shit has changed and WSB isn't the same. 

So if there are posts that are more entertaining post it, if there's a stupid ass stock you want to talk about, talk about it.

I'll start

EPR - It's a REIT that is mostly concentrated in mega-plex movie theaters, they also own most of the TopGolf locations, some knock off Dave and Busters, and until recently, a bunch of charter and early education schools. 

They finalized the sale of most of their gay school shit a few days after the Dept of Justice announced it was ending the Antitrust rules that were in place to prevent movie production companies from owning movie theaters.

Now they have about half a billion in cash to pay for NFLX movie theaters, or maybe a DIS mega-plex with chairs designed with fat star wars fans in mind or a theater specifically for annoying ass kids movies. 

Anywho, they have cash, the CEO said they will use that cash in early 2020 but wouldn't say what for, and they pay a monthly dividend that boomers won't leave even if the economy tanks.",Shkreli2020,wallstreetbets,0.0

Their attempt a series was c- and I’m being generous. Amazon Prime will remain a subscription beast no doubt but definitely not because it has an arsenal of great tv, but because of e-commerce. So it comes down to DIS and NFLX. I can’t see ppl watching g - pg-13 all the time. If anything DIS will be an addition and create a healthy competition. I think it’d be interesting to see users disposable income because I believe majority will keep both services or at the very least keep one alternate the other or vice versa. With the Witcher, Stranger things, altered carbon, black mirror, ozark, narcos, whatever those game of thrones guys are making and other original content tailored to specific countries, yea DIS is hot right now and will be even more so when the mcu series start in late 2020 but I say NFLX will have a strong 2020/2021 as well.",air2throne,wallstreetbets,2.0
