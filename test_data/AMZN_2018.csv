I learned by getting burned... is there any other way?  Diversification is a bunch of bullshit.  Amzn has crazy growth in India, why do I need to have an intl growth guy w assets there.  For fixed income apple &amp; brka get better rates than treasury, so I’ll let them handle the fixed income.  I left the business because I hated how my involvement with their accounts cost them money.  Im very anti having financial advisers make more than 25 basis points, the industry disgusted me so I got out and manage my own money.  When I meet people or old clients I advise them for free and have them do their own trades at places like schwab.

If you were one of my clients you wouldnt be pissed because beating the market is the job.  Understanding risk return shows up when you beat the market, dont get it twisted.  Greatest thing about the biz is the numbers are the numbers.  The big firms put together a bunch of bs &amp; terms and its designed to confuse and cost more.  I currently own Tsla, lulu &amp; nvda and am looking to build a career helping the environment while making more funds to invest.  

But for all here, its nearly impossible to beat 50/50 brk.b &amp; qqq.  You just hold it and wait.

2,2018-01-05,"Jesus christ. MU is very challenging to evaluate since its a cyclical business. This is by far the largest upward cycle in company history. If they keep beating estimates they should be $70 by EOY.
APLS - Meme stock, high risk high reward if your in a gambling mood go with it.
BABA Pretty close to neutral value, expect roughly 35% inrease each year for the next 3-4 years, same for NVDA. 
JD is similar to AMZN with the exception that they dilute their shares like fuck, many people wonder why their value dosn't go up as their revenues increase, its because after doubling revenues in the last 2 years, they also have double the shares outstanding + a fuck ton debt. This is a do or die time for them, they can't keep raising money like this forever (althrough they probably feel like they have to cause of how intense the chinese market is)
AMD - If EPYC is a success they can probably reach $15+ this year. They will not succeed against NVDA in the GPU market, the intel scandal is the best news AMD could have hoped for. This should be a huge year for them.

I would consider replacing JD with BIDU",TalentedTom,wallstreetbets,2.0
0,2018-01-07,"Interesting. So you're really aiming for practically 90% rate of success, and that's probably boosted by using an index itself. With such a low delta value, are you ever having issues with liquidity? I attempted to go down to lower delta values on things like GOOGL, AMZN, and ran into liquidity issues so I steered away from it. Although on an index, this issue may not be present... I do like the stop loss strategy you employ though, I may decide to incorporate something similar. Makes sense using lots of capital with such a high probability trade, though. And yes I could imagine the commissions would be horrendous on 80-100 contracts, and you must be working with an immense amount of capital. 

I use a similar strategy with stocks as well. I typically only trade with trend though. Ex. AAPL = bullish, I will find a point where I see support and sell short put vertical a decent distance under that support area w/ 0.3 to 0.4 delta similar to you. I also base it off the underlying going below the support area initially identified when entering the trade. Seems to work out well.

Question though. Do you use any sort of scanner to find stocks that fit these conditions when looking to open credit spreads? That's the only issue I've recently run into. I mostly look for highly traded stocks with over 1Mil volume and liquid options, but I want to find other ones in an easier way. 

But yes I agree lol, it's definitely nice to speak with you as well. You seem to employ great risk management strategies and I'm sure trading has gone well for you so far. And yes I've done well so far this year too. I believe tech, materials, and financials will all continue to outperform this year. ",WSEnthusiast,wallstreetbets,0.0

9,2018-04-04,"Careful. I think you missed a lot in your DD. Keep in mind that Shopify right now is trading at about 20x gross profit for this year. If they were acquired (which they won't be, because Tobi knows they are worth more than current value) many operating costs would be absorbed as synergies. So already you're looking at a 30 P/E company (from that valuation standpoint) that just reported 70% growth. Netflix currently trades over 30x gross profit for comparison.

I certainly wouldn't be confident in the idea that Shop is overvalued. You would have been wrong on many companies in the past like AMZN and CRM - if you look at the wrong numbers it's easy to get caught in a bear trap. There's an important difference between companies that are investing heavily in growth to secure dominance, and companies that will unlikely be profitable down the line. Shopify is likely in the former category. Their business model is sound.

Last point I'll make is to be careful with the revenue/GMV argument - it's not a very useful comparison metric. If you included Visa in your comparison, you'd have seen Visa makes about 0.2%. Percentage and trends here are largely irrelevant at this point. Most likely the reason why the number dropped slightly for SHOP is because SHOP's higher tiered plans (and customers) grew faster, which charge a lower fee per transaction. So that is actually a good thing - if SHOP is attracting larger more established customers.

And actually one more thing - I've found for comparison purposes, CRM is shockingly similar in terms of many basic metrics from back in 2007/2009. So if you want to compare to other companies I would suggest checking that one out as well. Good luck.

*^^wages ^^are ^^only ^^redeemable ^^at ^^the ^^company ^^store 

Free market capitalism is what creates income inequality. It is inherent to the system and in the end one guy owns everything. That's how the system works in theory and in practice always. That's how it was with industrial revolution tycoons and that's what AMZN is doing now. AMZN can put any business out of business because their 'w.e the fuck new segment' can under cut any competitions prices and run at a loss until all their competitors go out of business. If someone has some sort of an advantage and thus a resilent business they cant destroy through force, they'll just buy it. then with no competition jack up the prices. so they're making a killing, but their employees who work full time will still need to leech government benefits because they don't earn a living wage.

Oh and its also done this litte thing like destroy the planet beyond repair in the last 100 years, nbd tho we'll figure that out when we have to.

There's a lot not to like that girls want to fuck attractive guys, but sitting around and bitching about it instead of doing what you can to make yourself more attractive is just pissing into the wind. that's how I view LSC, the r/niceguys of economics.

WSB is more like TRP of economics- they think they found out some deep dark hidden secrets but 95% of the shit I see is either A) blatantly obvious to someone who doesn't fall into the LSC/niceguys mold or B) Some psuedo-broscience BS that is only really scratching the surface of w.e they're talking about and probably just as likely to back fire as it is to work. Also the """"field reports"""" are pure autism, as are the yolo reports posted here.

3,2018-04-12,"*Full disclosure, I haven't read your entire post*

I watched an interview with Mark Spiegel where he made a lot of similar points, he went as far as calling Elon Musk a fraud and a stock promoter. I don't remember any details, but all summed up he made a really great case for shorting TSLA. He also admitted to the problem that it's a cult stock and it might keep going up, but he's short (and has been since $90 but has added to his position at 200 and 300). He probably lost a lot of money on TSLA and AMZN shorts, but I think his thesis makes sense in any market that isn't as irrational as what we currently have. He made a lot of points not just about fraud or almost fraudulent practises (""creative accounting"" and such) and burning cash but also the insane competition that Tesla will soon face, they obviously aren't the only ones making EV and he thinks they'll be outdone by better, more experienced car companies soon. Another point he made was about how Elon treats the public short sellers, ridiculing and insulting them; apparently no CEOs who have treated well-researched critics like that have seen their company do well in the long run.

Overall, I was very convinced but I wouldn't touch it with a 10ft pole; if really good traders can lose loads of money with an insane amount of research that spans over years and lots of connections and capital backing their bet, I'll probably lose my entire account over it. Maybe if I saw a definite catalyst, but so far they've been able to brush off anything that would have lost other companies like 60% of their market cap.",nikmav2,wallstreetbets,3.0

0,2018-05-06,"The example shown in the picture is an example of what I will be discussing here.  NVDA earnings play selling Vertical Puts.  Max profit per contract $112, max loss $138.  My breakeven is $3 under the current stock price *and* I’m bullish.  Seems to good to be true.  So here’s the story:

Usually Im a staunch 45 DTE Iron Condor outside of earnings guy.  I’m learning how to stack the odds massively in my favor...hopefully.
But due to the fervor around this time of year, and the love for earnings in my fav sub evar, Ive been looking at earnings plays lately.  I've done like 5 in the last few weeks, all W’s.  I’ve only done the true YOLO no covered option call once.  The rest I have sold vertical put spreads but still in the weeklies. I try to get it in on Monday.  YOLOs are looking less and less like the way to go if you are looking for good consistent profits and covering yourself from decimating losses. Now i’m in testing phase so Im betting 1-2 contracts at a time, all referenced bets will be referring to single contract numbers.  If you want to scale just bump up the amount of contracts and the theory holds true.  To be clear, I am posting here to have you poke holes in my theories, give me reasons to NOT bet earnings after you read through my observations.

For example my one YOLO FD was on SQ last week.  SQ $43 call for $500.  I risked $500 for undefined max profit.  Could be a real huge winner, right?  Well as my analysis for the week went on and on, I realized I would have to have a unicorn runup to actually get respecible tendies.  That huge jump needed seems to come very very seldom.  I made $115 risking $500 and the stock def went up.  Seems like a lousy return on a high premium for such a “guess bet” but hey it was a W so good by me.  They amount underlying on SQ would have to go up to really make it worth it was kinda ridiculous.

*Good things about YOLO* - you can have unlimited profit potential and it also means you are a man of large juevos or a woman of large jugs.

Now I’d like to take a second to talk about what my favs have been, selling Vertical Put Spreads.  I guess I sell vertical put spreads b/c I bet on what I’m bullish on and this is the way I was able to build a trade that does just what I was looking for.  A few reasons I like these...you get the benefits of IV Crush which can certainly bump you up a couple ticks once earnings occur. FD folks are understandably grouchy about IV crush.  Put Spreads takes much less capital to cover the position.  Basically you are only waiting for the underlying price to be right above or below your break even….after that you are max loss or max profit like instantly.  Well to be fair I’ve gotten out at 90%, 63%, 85% and 76% of max profit.  This is me just almost instantly at open closing the position and taking the profit.  If you really wanted to hold until exp I’m sure you could 98% this method but with less chance of taking a profit. Not me.

For example a couple of my earnings plays that were selling covered put spreads.  Now these are already at the money or in the money for the break even:

MA Earnings last week. Selling Vertical Put spread 2 contracts.  $238 max profit, $262 max loss.  Came out with $214 profit which is 90% of max profit.

AMZN earnings 2 weeks ago. Selling Vertical Put spread 1 contract.  $377 max profit, 366 max loss.  Come out with $311 which is 85%.

I mean these aren’t knock it out of the park tendies but WSB doesn’t do single contract now do they?  Just expand to as many contracts as you want!  I feel like it is MUCH easier to get significantly higher profit much quicker than FD yolos while risking less capital.  Prove me wrong 

If you are interested in how I pick what earnings to play, I literally look at the most anticipated earnings threads on wsb, options and investing.  I’ll take hours to look at peoples comments and mark down the tickers that have the most positive sentiment.  Then I look at the tickers, the 1 year chart to see if we have a dip or ATH, the liquidity (bid/ask spread), I check analyst sites for technicals that I don’t fully understand yet.  Then from that list of 40 earnings or whatever I pick the 3 or 4 that seem like an overwhelming bullish prospect.  Set up the trades in TOS on Sunday, save em and wait for the bell.  Wish I could do more analysis but I already spend a ton of time studying Iron Condors so this is like my guilty pleasure.  Then I do have to go outside ya know.

I would post this over at r/investing or r/options but I like the humor here and when you read between the lines there are plenty of people who have valuable opinions, you just have to do the research to ensure they aren’t trolling you, which I have been plenty times.

They are hyperspending while other auto mfgs are avoiding the elephant by putting half-assed efforts and retaining stale assets. They have to create a tesla-esque-or-better-2025 plant while still showing profit (to please shareholders) on an already razor-thin margin. If they aren't doing the definition of *kicking the can down the road* ...well, godspeed. Added bonus: they're literally paying a dividend to shareholders instead of investing in EV infrastructure. Why? [Because the board &amp; CEO are old as fuck and think short-term politics is a good thing.](https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future-ebook/dp/B00J6YBOFQ).

(Existing PPOE of a car mfg is a technologically stale asset. To re-adjust for the EV revolution -- which is 100% happening -- is ungodly expensive)

As odd as it sounds, seeking a *profit* on TSLA's balance sheet at this stage is penny-wise, dollar stupid. Much like amazon and most other tech companies, the shit you do in the early stages really fucking pays off later.

Having said that, of these companies, the only one I think will not exist in the way it does now is AMZN.

2,2018-06-11,"1. Fundamentals

Without going into too much detail, Applied Materials is just a solid company. In the notoriously cyclical semiconductor industry, Applied has posted steady increases in revenue and EPS over the last five years, just about every quarter. The only times that revenue and EPS were flat (Q2\-Q3 2013, Q2\-Q3 2014, Q1 2017), it rebounded with strong growth immediately. The last five quarters (since Q1 2017), the growth has been especially strong. It has the most diverse offering of the semiconductor supply companies, making it more resilient to individual trends. And its customer service business is growing steadily, making up for the intermittent declines in equipment demand. It consistently beats its own guidance. In fact, it has met or exceeded its guidance in each of the last 22 quarters for adjusted EPS. I didn’t even stop at 22 because it didn’t meet expectations before that; I just stopped researching. This company has grown in all business climates. It has good cash flow, low debt, and shows no signs of stopping.

2.  Tech = Good

We all know tech is here to stay. We know this is just the beginning. When Intel’s CEO talked about data being the new oil, and when Applied’s CEO talked about the technological revolution being fueled by semiconductors in the same way the industrial revolution was fueled by oil, they know what they are talking about. It’s not hype. And while MU, AMD, INTC, NVDA, and all the other chip producers and tech suppliers are innovating, they need new equipment and fabs. They need more, faster. And their demand will fuel AMAT. The sky is the limit in tech, and Applied is definitely along for the ride.

3.  AMAT’s leadership and institutional investors believe in the company.

Before MU made it cool, AMAT was buying back shares at a blistering pace. In the last 3 years, AMAT has bought back 230 million shares. As in, close to 25&amp;#37; of its current share total. It still has billions of dollars left on its share repurchase authorization and they are jumping on this opportunity to buy shares cheaply. Since its last earnings report, AMAT has bought back 40 million shares, or about $2 billion worth. Oh, and on top of that, it just doubled its dividend in February. No big deal. And institutions own over 80&amp;#37; of AMAT’s stock. That’s on the high end (AMZN: 58&amp;#37;, NVDA: 66&amp;#37;, APPL: 61&amp;#37;, FB: 74&amp;#37;, MU: 79&amp;#37;). There is lots of faith among the people who know what they are doing.

4.  MU earnings as catalyst.

We all love MU here, and I don’t think it’s a bad idea to stay in MU. But if you want to play MU earnings without suffering the sell\-off and IV crush, AMAT is your play. Twice out of the last four earnings reports, MU has literally stopped an AMAT drop and sent it flying. Just look at the AMAT 1\-year chart and note 6/29/17 and 9/26/17. Before 6/29, AMAT dropped about 8&amp;#37;. Then, after MU reported earnings, AMAT went up 14&amp;#37; over the next few weeks. Before 9/26, AMAT dropped about 5&amp;#37;. Then, after MU reported earnings, AMAT went up 22&amp;#37; in less than a month. This is because as MU succeeds, it raises its capital expenditures. And that it good news for its equipment suppliers. And bigger than that, MU has an off\-cycle earnings date, so it’s our first look at the industry heading into Q3 (AVGO has a very different business model). So if you’re bullish on MU, consider hopping aboard.

5.  We don’t know when the trade war will resolve.

Admittedly, AMAT is sensitive to trade war tensions with China. We don’t know what’s going to happen with that. It might take years. It might take months. Maybe they’ll figure it out soon. I don’t know. What I do know is that when they do figure it out, and come to some deal, all the pressure that pushed AMAT down 10&amp;#37; will lift and it will immediately jump. I want to be there for that. And in the meantime, I’ll take the minor swings of bad news and good news.

Somebody convince me I’m wrong.",originalmuggins,wallstreetbets,2.0
3,2018-06-11,"We can compare them though. Similar to AMZN, which had an extremely high capex up-front and was left ridiculed by P/E-based metrics for years and years until -- well whadya know -- it starts to hit e-commerce escape velocity. Even then, AMZN got margin-lucky with their AWS, which allows them to show a bit of profit and subsidize the retail takeover further. 

They aren't supposedly ""high-tech"" -- they are. Just because you can't tell the difference between the difference between a Ford plant and a TSLA factory ...well, that's on you. And I'm not trying to be a dick, but genuinely...they're different. One is incrementally-added 100Y/O technology, and the other started tabula rasa with the idea that almost all of it *can* be automated.

Also, worth noting, since you're correct in that tech companies having extremely high growth with extremely low capex (at least for most tech platforms), TSLA is the only mfg goods company in history to scale from 10M - 100M in under 6 years. Nobody comes close, and it's about the same as AMZN, FB, with GOOGL ahead.

8,2018-06-11,"Sure. So first, I somehow learned that the stock was down 10% on a single day, which in equities is considered a pretty large drop. I don't know why, but probably because someone in wsb once posted about the stock, it was on my cnbs watch list of potential longs. I Googled YY to find out why this drop happened. It was the day after an earnings report. I read that YY beat both growth and earnings consensus (the mean or median of what analysts predicted for that quarter), which is a fundamentally positive sign. I then briefly went through the comments section on seekingalpha, on the post where the earnings call transcript (or the results, don't remember) ist posted. My assumption was that management gave pessimistic guidance on the day of the earnings report. This could explain a big drop after beating earnings (remember, for valuation, the future outlook matters disproportionately more than then past). I then couldn't find substantial negative news, and the reader comments were bullish. Yes, I give weight to seekingalpha comments, and this is empirically well founded (there is an academic paper on it in the review of financial studies, one of the leading finance joirnals). So it looked to me that the stock dropped although the company was growing hard. I then looked at the stocks' past trading history, using the graph from Google. My fear here was that maybe the stock had appreciated to all time highs before earnings report. This would be a red flag, as it would mean the stock would have to beat its past all time high again after the drop. I found that before the drop, the stock didn't trade very closely to its last all time high, so this concern was off the table. As a last check, I then Googled what the firm actually does. I honestly don't remember now the answer (in other words, yes I am long YY and have no idea what they do) but the point of this step was to reality-check whether their business model seems completely trash or irrational to me. As you can see, all what I did so far contains a large degree of subjectivity. I then knew I wanted to bet on a recovery of the stock price. As I have about 30k available for trading (which is nothing) at that moment, and as I'm not very risk averse (I am young and have a good and stable income), I decided to realize that bet by buying call options rather than equity - to compensate for my low equity base using leverage provided by options. The question then was, what strike and maturity? As I have been burned and lost many thousands by trying to time the stock movement (I. E., when adding the time dimension to my Hypothesis that the stock price will increase over time, I was often too optimistic, btw. just like someone else in this thread), I decided to go for options that are further out, at least 6 months. This represents some safety for me, because again doing basic TA I found that the stock often recovered fast (within less than a month) after a big drop. I then went on yahoo finance and looked at the option chain for YY. I looked at trading volume mainly, because I have been burned badly before by trading illiquid options, which result in a wide spread, which result in you significantly overpaying for the option. Not surprisingly, I found that the ATM options were among the most traded on that day. I picked 110 because they were ATM or slightly OTM, and because volume was high, and I picked January because iirc there were no options with expiry in six months (December) available, and so I went to the next date further out. I entered the position with the intention of taking at most a loss of 20%, due to my inexistent due diligence. I almost always cut at 20% loss, and had I not done that on an Amzn play that went against me, I would be completely wiped out by now. What is bad right now for me, is that I still haven't figured out a target price on the upside. I tend to take gains at 50% or 100%, but I suck in that I let the rest of my portfolio affect how much risk I should take, which I feel is a behavioral problem I have. Knowing when to sell is something I haven't figured out too well yet. If the stock appreciates further, I will 100% close my position on the day before the next earnings release, as I expect that ""drop after beat"" might just be in the nature of this stock. Because I like to be entertained, I also went for the short term July options, fully willing to take a full loss if it goes against me. However, I invested about 1.5k in the July play, and about 4k in the January play. Hope my babbling nonsense is helpful to you. Since I started trading last September, I more than doubled my money. I have currently 30k in gains since that time, started with 30k. Had to take out some money recently to pay for living expenses and an unexpected, not trading-related tax charge. This post summarizes my general reasoning. The bigger a potential position, the more I hesitate to enter it. For MU, my biggest holding, I did a full DCF analysis to gauge market expectations vs current price. A pretty exhaustive excel file with lots of scenario analyses. Additionally, I am reading all I can on semiconductor and storage industry, which is fucking complicated if you're not an electrical engineer or sector analyst. ",knightwhosaysni2,wallstreetbets,8.0

3,2018-07-02,"Great response and you've hit on a lot of really good points.

The poster above you talks about the huge moat FB, AMZN, and NFLX have. That's all hindsight bias, as you've hinted at in your post. Everyone and their mom tried to make a social media company, and basically failed to gain any traction. Google tried (and failed) at least twice. Microsoft failed multiple times as well. Most of the winning social media companies are country centric. Russia has it's own and so does China, for example.

&gt;For whatever retarded reason, no TV companies, probably due to the prevailing corporate culture not caring about innovation, thought to invest in online services.

Hulu not withstanding, I imagine? Also, I think Hulu seriously screwed the pooch by adding in commercials. Amazon prime is interesting, but doesn't have the friendly UI/UX of Netflix or the integration with TV. 

The one part of your set of posts I do disagree with is 

&gt;And other, bigger, profitable companies take those ideas and slap their logos on them. FFS Tesla made all their plans publicly available.

Now - to be perfectly frank, I'm in no way in a position to drill in on the validity, but [this article](http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2017/05/11/tesla-battery-patents-elon-musks-duplicitous/id=81839/) and [this article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2014/06/16/what-tesla-stands-to-gain-from-sharing-its-patents/#316d4ec5665d) talk a little bit behind the strategy and requirements of using Tesla's technology. In general, [there is quite a bit of skepticism](https://business.financialpost.com/legal-post/tesla-motors-inc-patents-warning) regarding the open patent approach. 

I think it's pretty brilliant and does a lot to continue to cultivate Elon Musks' cult of personality persona that's driving a lot of the fervor behind him and his companies. The licensing of battery technology will be a constant win, especially if you believe that recent articles that say Tesla battery technology is at least 2 years ahead of the competition.

No reason to  go more pedal to the metal. Reassess what you are doing. Practice. Also shouldn’t be risking 15% of account (especially if t causes anxiety).

If you want to scalp, use smaller amount of funds that helps you think clearly. 

As you get a feel, size up. Maybe practice on getting one or two MSFT options slightly OTM or ITM. MSFT 8/10 $110’s were .21 a pop this morning. Size up after you get better feel. 

Or scalp long dated options at realistic strikes. They move slow like owning a few shares.

You want to scalp AMZN? Watch contracts and write down where you’d enter and where you’d sell. Protect your capital by preparation like this.

Here's what's coming up and will bring this stock back into the $80s:

- WoW expansion. This game has been running for &gt; 5000 days now. It releases next week, and launch weeks have always been phenomenal for this game.

- CoD:BO4. There's mixed reviews on a recent multiplayer beta, and plenty of misinformation about what the game will contain. That said, ATVI thinks this will be one of the biggest COD releases of the series.

- Esports. Overwatch league finals sold out Barclay's in NYC; they just signed 2 new teams at $30-60M (over initial team sales of $20M). Partnerships with AMZN / Disney guarantee Twitch &amp; ESPN coverage for big events.

I entered a bull put spread on AMZN the other day, then the price turned against me and dipped into the Loss Zone.  I closed it out while I was in the danger zone, but somehow the increased IV from the dip had made the spread profitable on that day at that price

I also noticed that [put-call parity](https://www.investopedia.com/university/options-pricing/put-call-parity.asp) has been off occasionally on AMZN spreads, and a couple of times I used the imbalance to virtually close out bull put spreads with bear call spreads rather than eating a day trade to close them.

Slow down there buddy... They are okay now, but I see them having trouble in the future.  Regional chains, like Meijer or HEB have started to slowly eat into their (mostly grocery) maketshare.  It seems like the problem likely stems from their thousands of minimum wage employees with poor training and miniscule opportunity to make a decent wage through promotion.  Not to mention the working culture of Walmart has been compared to being jailed by my friends.  The regional chains typically pay better or have a better culture or both.  This translates directly into customer experience and getting asses in the door.

Walmart cannot realistically compete with AMZN online and is getting increasingly squeezed by other chains.  They good now, but the future is far from clear.

Have you ever opened a short put position in your life? Max loss on a short put is the stock going to zero less your premium received. 

Short calls have theoretical unlimited downside (from the stock going up, as you incorrectly stated before).

This said, the key to trading oppies for premium (short positions) is to have the margin to get OUT when shit turns sour by rolling until things come good.

As long as you're not selling puts on BBY or GPRO then even a big dump like FBs recent assreaming can be recovered by rolling the position out infinitely until it recovers.

Same thing with short calls, TYPICALLY unless its AMZN or APPL you can keep rolling ITM short calls and usually roll up strikes for 0 credit and finally get yourself out that way.

Basically, you only lose when you dont have money to manage margin.

29,2018-09-03,"I only sell vertical spreads and my approach is to monitor each one independently. My strategy is probably too conservative for this subreddit for the most part, however it works for me. 

I usually aim for 20-30% profit and the resulting timeline varies from 3mo-12mo. Additionally, I only sell options far out of the money; generally put spreads no less than 10% below the current stock price, but I prefer 20%. 

Some stocks like HD have kind of stalled out, so my options haven’t moved much while still 8mo from exp. in this case I continue to hold

Others like AAPL, AMZN, V shot up and I was able to make 40-70% of my expected returns in just a month or so. When this happens I don’t get greedy and either roll them over or close the position. 

I almost never keep options until they expire, because there usually isn’t much profit left to be had on vertical spreads out of the money. 

Also, keep an eye on, what I call, ‘associated stock risk’ and make sure you don’t have an insane amount leveraged. Don’t forget that options that expire on Fridays and not executed until Monday at the bell, so if there is a large move over the weekend you can end up losing a ton of money.

I still come back to this sub every once in a while, but using Robinhood, with a bit of margin, to hold NVDA, AMD, MSFT, and AMZN for roughly the last year and a half has proven to be the best strategy for me, by far.

3,2018-09-06,"All of AMZNs dips today were mirrored in most nasdaq stocks representing either a “broad tech sell off” (bullshit) or an overreaction to fears of possible tech regulation due to todays Senate hearing that went extremely poorly for many reasons.  The dip was too coordinated to be result of many money managers, only possibility is Papa Bezos withdrawing some Blue Origin monies which he does every year, that is the only whale large enough to cause the sell off and that is unlikely. If you watched the Senate committee meeting you saw that **it went terribly**, however regulation would never occur because the technological challenges are far too complex to propose any regulation, **AND** this *should* only affect social media sites and the like, where their platform is free because **YOU are the product**, this is absolutely not the case with AMZN. Trade war won’t affect AMZN, it is China-proof. AMZN will never face regulation because the US antitrust laws are put into place to prevent monopolies from being able to unfairly hurt customers, AMZN is most customer focused retailer **ever**, absurd to realistically postulate AMZN tried in antitrust.

TLDR; 
Widespread coordinated tech selloff? Unlikely. 
Overreaction to fear of gov regulation? Very likely, yet very unwarranted. 
Anyone who bought AMZN today got sweet deal. 
Institutions will continue to pour in from China stocks, FANG ETFs will rebalance FB and Netflix (maybe even GOOG?) *into* AMZN and AAPL.

Use TA to your advantage. I know it's a meme but options require precise entries and exits.

2.	P/E should be positive, or have a damn good reason not to be. (Early stage startup, low cap, growth burn’
3.	P/E should be reasonably lowish for its age and growth potential (Compare AAPL to AMZN. These are established companies. Is the growth potential accurately reflected in PE?)
4.	Momentum
5.	Fundamentals on the specific contract are important. RH makes it easy to buy contracts with 0 active interest. Aim for around 3 month term, and as deep ITM as reasonable for Delta and Theta.

If you don’t know what any of that means, just buy SPY calls three months out that only require 3% to break even.

Buy long term LEAPS ATM or ITM.  I don't care if you can only buy 3 or 4 contracts.  It's safe, it's still leveraged, and it's very possible to make 20-40% in 6 months.

21,2018-09-09,"Back at you.

I think it’s about consolidation in part. Instead of being involved across the board and diluting potential impact, he chose to be highly involved at one. 

Put the money there, own higher stake and help create an even stronger future for Apple with Berks wholehearted help and the incentive to do so for his successors, as future Berk profitability will rely in part on Apples continued success. 

Amazon probably isn’t interested in outside help to innovate. They already innovate and do new crazy things all the time. 

AAPL definitely can expand it’s book, and currently has much better financials than AMZN. So I think AAPL is ultimately more receptive and needs Berk more than AMZN would. 

Again, I see this as Warren handing over the reigns, in part, to AAPL in some ways. Basically he feels better about his shareholders futures in an intertwined relationship that is mutually beneficial to both. Which all ensures health and longevity for his own company - his legacy. 

I thought he was losing his mind too, but this makes sense to me as giving Warren benefit of the doubt. It’s the prudent thing to do imo given how prolific he’s been - to at least run an analysis where he is right and why he could be right.

AAPL looking like it’ll be in the car game in the coming years as well. There will be many other industries they break into, like they did with watches. 

Buffet likely figures that if he can’t live forever and run his company, that he will fuse it with the most valuable company in the world. Which bodes well for Berks future well after Warren is gone.

Warren via Berkshire is trying to inject as much in as he can so that Berk always has a spot at the table for leading AAPL. Berk is involved in so many industries that the relationship between the two will continue to be mutually beneficial. What AAPL is today won’t be what it is 10-15 years from now.

 don't look at them until late this month. If your limit triggers that's great, you get tendies. If it doesn't,  you're muchmore likely to be at a better price target than you are now. REMEMBER, we did just go through 4-5 straight down days.

5,2018-09-12,"Really tough, depends how you entered them and account sizing. For example in my main account I like to do an initial entry of ~12k-20k for a single position (assuming it isn't more of a 'gamble' play where I'll risk less but expect more %). With that, I'll be willing to add another 6k-10k if it moves against me but I still like it. I don't mean I'm down 5% after a few minutes, I mean a few days or so where overall market conditions draga position but underlying view/DD hasn't changed. Thinking you will time markets perfectly will drive you mad (and bankrupt). Certain tickers just require more capital to really have fun with (AMZN, TSLA) but this is speaking to my general average positions. 

One example that gives me more breathing room is I love to enter a position with verticals. ATVI was one such play. I knew I was very bullish on it after its earnings (I did not play earnings). Gave it the pre-requisite couple day wait for things to settle out and bought my 72.5C and sold the 85C (all for November) when the underlying was ~$70.5x. We got a nice move up and I just let it sit. Of course I am losing money on the 85C that I sold, but gaining more on the 72.5's and I already know my max profit ($1,250-cost of vertical * number of contracts) so I don't really worry. Well, sure enough that bullshit analyst ""muh fortnite!"" report came out and ATVI dropped ~$2.50 overnight. Nothing changed in my view (and some 'analyst' being bearish only further affirmed my bullish outlook). This also dropped right in the middle of more tariff fud and overall market lethargy. The nice thing about this is that I was able to wait a day and make sure ATVI found some footing and I bought back the 85C I sold for a profit (I sold them to someone else and then bought them back from the market later for less money). This alleviated a lot of position stress because I was able to recoup some losses and give myself significantly more breathing room on the long side. Because I also was still bullish and felt ATVI was being unfairly beat up by negativity surrounding EA/""tariffs"" and massively overstated support for Fortnite, I added to my long 72.5C position after I closed the sold 85C. Since that day ATVI has posted 4 green closes. Yesterday I started to work out of the 62 contracts I had. I sold a small chunk (12, I believe) to lock some gains in and more importantly get the position sizing back within my ""comfort zone"" (at the height, I had about $28k just in long ATVI contracts). Today I unloaded a further 40 contracts after such a fantastic day. I still firmly believe they'll test ATH/break out but I'm happy to let just 10 deep ITM contracts covering the next ER report time-frame ride and not even think twice about them or fret over them unless it breaks ATH in the next 2 days. I'll further shave a few and then just set alerts for it pulling back some so I can re-enter. 

Of course, I would have made more cash if I had just said ""FUCK IT, YOLO ALL IN"" and bought all 62 Nov 72.5C's on day 1, but it would have been a HELL of a lot tougher to sit there watching my $28k position down -$10k after 48 hours. Instead, I was never down more than roughly 3-4k due to staggered entries and selling further OTM calls. Due to this, the position moves didn't happen immediately so I felt I could still safely control and monitor with a clear head and not be tempted to emotionally trade.

I've lost some pretty big chunks of cash this way. Stepping back and re-evaluating, it really isn't too hard to hit 10-40% moves using options (more ""swing"" trading than day trading) and sitting in safer positions doing it. In current bull climate, the average has been closer to 65%. Lots of 50+ day ATM/ITM, verticals, etc. Patience also key, shit is always moving and there is always some bagger that you are missing so it can psychologically wreck people (especially bad gamblers).

&gt; I started in 2015 and got 4 shares in 2017, 3 this year, and I’ll get 2 in 2019.

thats not half bad. this dude picked up 7 shares in 2 years, which if he didn't sold is worth 14k now. and 2 shares in 2019 is an extra 4k. no such thing as freebies though, as evident from other comments in that thread you gotta be around for awhile before you start getting shares. seems like 2-3 years is when the benefit actually starts kicking in.

with the new wage plan, they will introduce some sort of share purchase program which presumably will offer more benefit for newcomers. old timers will have less incentive to stick around, that's for sure.

also i only give a F because at this price range in a high cost of living area, they will be my competitor for entry-level staff/employees to hire. harder to offer 13/hour office work if some people are willing to do a bit more physical demanding work for a solid 15/hour - especially during busy holiday season where they'll grab bunch of temp worker",freehouse_throwaway,wallstreetbets,1.0

1) If they're increasing robot workers and decreasing human workforce, they'll be increasing supply of human employees thus driving down wage (or keeping them stagnant) due to higher competition. You don't get to fire a bunch of humans and replace them with robots while simultaneously force competitors to raise wages as you unload a bunch of people into the market.

2) AMZN warehouses don't exactly compete with local retailers all over the US serving in-person markets. At least, not yet. They don't compete in type of work (AMZN warehouse more akin to UPS meat grinder than cashier at WMT/TGT). They also don't compete in location/frequency. 

Article seems a little too rose-tinted for my tastes and makes parallels that I don't really see as legitimate. There is also nothing stopping other existing brick and mortar retail from adopting cashier-less experience and other items once it is proven. ",usmc35,wallstreetbets,69.0

51,2018-10-03,"Honestly, he's a shill for Bezos whether he realized it or not. 

He pushed AMZN into a situation where they actually homogenized lower class incomes for their work force, while cutting future RSUs and other benefits for long term workers, while also. 

In other words, Bernie let Bezos create the same monetary savings of contract workers without the public backlash because people are too busy jerking off that Bernie won. On average, Bezos will save $1500 on low tier labor costs. Sure the short-run analysis is Bezos is a cuck, the long-run analysis is Bezos played Bernie like a fiddle. 

He literally got Bernie to cheer for the homogenization of worker pay, the cutting of additional benefits that rewarded consistent hard work. That is what Bezos has wanted to do but couldn't until Bernie created the political capital for Bezos to use. Now low skill workers are no longer given any kind of stock, they no longer partake in the privilege of their own company's growth, 30-40 years from now when Amazon owns an even larger percentage of the world retail market, and when their stock price is sky high, when all these workers are looking to vest, and cash in for retirement. They can't. 

Also, RSU contracts typically are temporally vested, meaning that they only get the benefits of that stock after a certain time frame. So let's say you're a worker with 10 years of experience in the warehouse, you were making let's say $14/hr(and this is a pretty low ball estimate for 10 years experience), you had lots of unvested RSU. You are now bumped up to $15, but you now have a pay ceiling of $15.55(at least that's the word on the street, I don't know how true it is, but I don't think it sounds too farfetched). Basically, you've been told you are not getting any more RSU, whatever RSU you own won't vest for quite a while, and your raise is fucked. Even with that much experience, in the current labor market, there isn't a guarantee that you would get paid more than $15, and even if you could negotiate upwards, you certainly aren't going to get RSU from the next retail company. So now what has happened. Bezos has put experienced workers in a catch 22. The experience warehouse worker can't leave because of the RSU, no way they'll get more value from another company. Bezos is a genius, he got a license to fuck his experienced workers and they may not even fully realize how badly he fucked future AMZN workers. 

To be serious for a sec:
I'm bullish on amzn long run, but I'm a bit concerned by this move as it disincentivizes experienced workers. In my experience on the ground, the experienced workers ground a company like management, if they aren't on the floor correcting the newbie fuck ups, that creates a fair amount of deadweight loss. So I'll be very carefully watching production numbers and quotas from various large suppliers of amazon. Lastly, I'd be carefully watching labor market sentiment regarding low tier amazon workers. Without that incentive, I do think amazons efficiency with labor capital will go down a bit long run. That said, this will likely be offset by increases in economic capital investment(aka automation). Of course as I said, pay attention to supply metrics, and in particular, amzn production numbers and quotas. If you see them consistently not meeting targets, it would be worrisome and I would think back to this move against their executive floor employees(and I use executive loosely lol).

More importantly, Bernie gave bezos political cover for the move. Even if the information is released eventually, we all know that reddit will care, it may even be in the papers, but Bezos can respond with a Bernie-esque response of how he is homogenizing incomes so hard workers aren't rewarded as much. This also gives political capital to the republicans who can go to their hard working warehouse workers and say ""hey, look at this jagoff Bezos, him and Sanders colluded to take your benefits!"", and the sad part is, that wouldn't be entirely untruthful.

16,2018-10-04,"Apple's press release had some BS though:

""As a matter of practice, before servers are put into production at Apple they are inspected for security vulnerabilities and we update all firmware and software with the latest protections. We did not uncover any unusual vulnerabilities in the servers we purchased from Super Micro when we updated the firmware and software according to our standard procedures. ""

This is the crux of their defense. There's no way apple developed their own firmware/software for these servers. What happened was 1) New firmware build/software patch release
2) Apple installs them
3) Someone checks off ""nothing unusually here.""

AND there is no way they opened up and looked at each one of the servers themselves. 

This being said, I don't know if what Bloomberg is saying the truth either.  I suspect that they are saying something true-ish, and that both the Chinese and American gov organisations know the other one knows about whatever is going on (else there would be a gag-order from one fed agency or another.)

Another question is that if these chips are in fact installed, how effective are they in practice at executing permission changes on any of these servers. If they're ineffective, that it doesn't matter anyways.

Ultimately, the losses today are going to be washed out by a good jobs report from the Fed. The Fed doesn't raise rates on a bad jobs report unless inflation is spiking. Right now 2.2% CPI for the year sans food and fuel. The historic inflation target for the fed is 2.0%.

57,2018-10-04,"&gt;, i didn't take this AMZN gig for just the money

So $15/hr isn't all you're getting paid, factor this into your 'I'm underpaid' logic.

A migrant accepts a grossly underpaying job on a farm because he/she isn't qualified (by legal status/immigration/language barriers) to take any other job. So HE/SHE has come to the conclusion that its in their best interest to take the low wage (most likely illegal) job.  Definitely not because they are 'retarded' (lol nice point of view). More like this is what they can accept because of their social position in the country. Close analogy but not exactly because you are crossing into legal/illegal wages. You and your fellow co-workers are backed by state laws regulating work conditions &amp; wages.

Also, never claimed that Amazon jobs are 'just like any other part time job'. I'd also mention that I know that Amazon is insane (never stated otherwise), I'm simply saying they are not your Slave Master. Ive worked jobs (Enterprise Rent-A-Car specifically) where you are HIGHLY encouraged to never take a break (bathroom, lunch, whatever). Worked an unnumbered amount of days with no lunch break (Class action lawsuits can back up my claims).  I left. I found another job that pays slightly less but allows me to be a human BECAUSE THATS WHAT I VALUE.  You think this job should be done by someone less qualified or you should get paid more? Cool, Amazon (and others) thinks it should be done by robots. You obviously value something that this Amazon job provides you more than the hate you have for it otherwise you would have left.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll leave you with this. We live short lives, if you hate working for Amazon. Don't. Go do something that makes you happy.

accepting a job does not magically make an underpaid job no longer underpaid. that is flawed logic. i understand what you are trying to say... that people have free will to choose and move on. yes, but that is not the same as a job no longer being underpaid simply by accepting it. if a migrant accepts a job paying $3/hour in a farm in Cali... him taking it doesn't mean he is no longer underpaid. it means he is either retarded or he has no choice. also, your over generalization and over simplification of jobs pushing you to work more than what they pay is laughable. You think this is my first job? dude there is no job i've taken, full time or part time, where they have worked people like what I'm seeing at Amazon. you're over generalizing and claiming that a part time job at Amazon is just like any other part time job. Nope, not even close. I've never had a job where i felt pressured to not use the restroom. you hear about all those articles where AMZN workers say they feel pressure not to go to the bathroom due to quotas? well that shit is true. is that how it's like at other normal jobs? nope, definitely not normal.

If financials are not slated to see a deceleration, why do they later say that they find the sector least attractive?

&gt; Estimates have been trimmed across most sectors, led by Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples, but analysts have continued to revise up estimates within Tech

Hmm, AMZN might not do so hot if that's the case, and revising up estimates for tech will just create higher expectations, which means they have to report extra well.

6,2018-11-03,"If you buy a call, you're betting that the price is gonna go up. So you can pick a call option that is either ITM (In the money) or OTM (Out of the money) right? 

a ITM call option would be say, AMD is trading at 15$ and you buy a call for 15$ amd. If it goes up at all, you'll make money. If it goes down at all, you'll lose your money. 

And the reverse it true for puts. 

ITM options are more expensive, since you're more guaranteed to make a profit, while OTM options are cheap, cause you have a tiny percentage at actually getting to the strike price of your calls / puts. 

However, for example, I've been buying otm snap puts and calls. I got lucky cause I bought a call right as SNAP started to rally because people thought maybe AMZN or someone would buy them out. So I made a few bucks there. Now I have a bunch of SNAP puts for 11/16 and 11/23 because I can only afford short term OTM option contracts. I'm hoping to sell these contracts at a profit later, hopefully if SNAP tanks like, 20-50 cents.

I was able to double my money with some cheap otm contracts anyways, but it's a huge gamble. There has to be people willing to buy those contracts in the first place etc. 

To expand on what OP did though, he bought a bunch of call contracts for a certain strike price (215$) and AAPL ended up getting close to that strike price. Because it was much closer to the strike price, the contracts he owned were worth way more (Because the chance that you can make money is increased). I'm sure he bought those contracts months away, and paid much less for them. So he sold them today for like, x% gains. Looks to be around 50% or so. 

Since it's definitely a gamble to do plays on earning reports, the mofo just decided to be safe and cash out his AAPL call contracts and shit before the earnings report came out, and it ended up being his saving grace cause if he held, he would be down 5-6 figures.

34,2018-11-02,"first of all thanks for answering my dude. What would be events that might occur? And where do I get to know those? Isn't this some sort of insider trading?

Also, is the option more expensive if it's volatile? Is there a way to determine an options ""current price""? Like with a calculator or formula? Let's take [this](https://i.imgur.com/OjGBnhw.jpg) option as an example. Please correct me if I misunderstood anything.

1615$ is the strike price of the option which means if the price of the amazon stock exceeds 1615$, the option-holder can exercise the option.

AVG COST is the cost of the contract itself (the premium?).

AMZN BREAKEVEN PRICE is the price the amazon stock needs to reach for the option-holder to have a profit of +-0$ and is calculated by (Strike-Price + AVG COST).

Equity is = (Current Price * 100 * Contracts)

The guy paid (AVG COST * 100 * Contracts) for the options (= 60.300$)

EXP DATE means that the option has to either be exercised or expires worthless (?)

What I don't understand is how the Option's initial price and current price are determined. Like how do I know how much I'd have to pay for an option? And how do I know it's price... let's say 1 week after I bought the option? How can I calculate these prices?

The other argument is that they’re using their profits from AWS to compete at below market in e-commerce and other markets, which would be the 21st century equivalent of steel dumping. I don’t find this second argument as persuasive but the fact that half of everything sold online is through Amazon and no one else is even close is pretty compelling.

* $RYAAY pilot strike put play
* $AAPL q2 earnings call - followed daddy Buffett
* $VMW call - heard a tip from a WSB thread and lost my money
* $DBX call - heard a tip from a WSB thread and lost my money

* $TGT q2 earnings play - was undervalued from my calc, mobile app and mobile site traffic was up a shit ton on some dd sites. Figured that their mobile presence would be the thing investors would be looking at in order to compete with $AMZN
* $FB q3 earnings call - lost 90% of my trade. RIP. still extremely bullish but sticking to stock only with this one for now
* $ZG long term put - been looking for a house and the company is shit with tough competitors + going into mortgages/flipping houses

Current play - $NFLX 3/15/19 $290.25 long term put - Overvalued, $DIS will eat it's lunch when it finally comes out. Business model is flawed because it doesn't have the infrastructure like Disney and other studios to pump out and compliment OC

Apple is having issues lately, look at more stable stocks if you want *my* shitty opinion....

NFLX has been on the rise for the past few days, I've had calls on that; Dunno how much further back up it can go. Maybe $330-335? Meh

SQ calls since the recent dip have been juicy; Current dip action could be a good buy in. I think anything under $85 is solid choice at least a month and a half ish out for safe, 3-4 weeks for risky.

I fucking bought MU calls on their recent rise like a dumbass but here it is green, eh.

AMZN spreads always free money til it goes back to $1850-1900

V is stable free money lately; Bit pricey now though. Buy in around $140?

MSFT back on the rise...

27,2018-11-09,"First, this is one of the few real posts in the subreddit. I agree with others about wanting to see some of your bets and/or rationalizing exact call/put figures.

I agree with so much of your thesis. I’d like to add to your positioning on tech: Q4 isn’t going to be pretty. The big guns of AAPL, NVDA, INTC, AMD, AMAT, MU all have issues and/or anticipate a slowdowns moving forward. The larger picture is that we have broke away from Moore’s Law. It’s taking longer than 2 years to reach the next proverbial peg in design/performance. In the case of Intel, we are well behind their original timetable for smaller, more powerful chips. Similar stories for those in the tech/semi fields. On the consumer side, I think we’ve reached a tipping point regarding product pricing (AAPL and NVDA specifically). Less innovation or bang-for-your-buck. Enough product generations of this + rising prices = lower sales.

Tech companies that also provide some form of commerce grab my attention. AMZN, EBAY, SQ.

I have mixed feelings about how to play tech as a whole. I’m not sure if it’s better to go after a tech-centric etf like QQQ (holds a high % of AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, INTC, etc) or target the likes of AMD, AMAT,  NVDA directly. Post-Christmas dates for options look attractive right now.

10,2018-11-12,"Firstly I wouldn't buy such short dated options if you can afford longer dated.  3 months is a good rule of thumb as that gives your position time to recover.  Also, when purchasing calls/puts generally its a pretty good idea to do a spread.  Yes spreads cap your upside but they also prevent the bleed that is theta burn and you can make spreads pretty wide.  You're mostly in tech right now.  AAPL, SQ, AMZN(not tech but is priced as a crazy growth company), NFLX, ES(not tech but broadly correlated).  If you want to keep your portfolio the same and just control the risk then I'd sell some legs to turn all your calls into spreads and Id look at opening maybe one or two shorts.  You could look into a QQQ put as a hedge against your entire portfolio.  In order to give more suggestions I need to know your outlook.  I dont like giving blatant buy/sell advice because your account value is larger than mine, but I'm personally a bear.

Additionally, you may want to consider selling weekly calls against your $amzn calls for a credit; if you sell them near your strike price Id say it is a fairly safe bet as amzn isn't hitting 1850 anytime soon.

Margin is 10% unless you have a lot of money so $60k for a year costs $6,000 paid daily not $6000 upfront.

Margin accounts have to be opted into and you need minimum $25k to opt in. With a margin account you can day trade hundreds of times a day. If you fall under $25k with a margin account you can still trade on margin, but only day trade 3 times a week. A day trade is if you buy and sell a stock in the same day. Also, if you buy a stock like AMZN on Monday and then sell amazon three times that day it counts as three day trades. Then you can’t day trade again until next Monday. If you sell a stock bought the prior day then buy it again that’s not a day trade. If you day trade more than three times then etrade blocks you from using margin for like 90 days.

Bye bye $3k and fuck you gut for knowing and fuck you brain and arms and eyes and fingers for conspiring against gut. But fuck you most of all gut for not taking dramatic measures to ensure that other said body parts did what they should've done to avoid such an unnecessarily large loss. Uggh!!!


What else? Oh! Bought the SPY ""dip""^tm and was up 20% at one point today but didn't close that either (tf is wrong with me?). If (when) tomorrow sucks then that's just gonna get absolutely fucking rekt too. Bye bye $3k 2.0. Fuck something! Just fuck.


Watching my SPY call flip between green and red all day was akin to watching an autist drowning in the shallow end of an empty pool. Every time it found green (for a minute or two) I could hear it screaming in agony to just sell it and get the fuck out, but I inexplicably refused to step in and save the poor little bastard from what now looks to be an almost certain demise. I was like ""dude, just stand the fuck up and stop drowning in your own saliva!"" But those fuckers don't listen for shit and y'all already know this. I quite frankly deserve to get destroyed by a -0.666% SPY day tomorrow. Can't wait. Hail Satan. That cheeky cuck.


The scariest part of it all is that I still have some decent money to fuck with every wrong move in the thesaurus... until that innocent sum of hard-earned post-tax wages joins its fallen brethren in the money crematorium, that is. And don't anyone try to tell me what to do with that precious wad of cash. I won't let my baby be taken away by cash protective services. Not again.


I should buy something. Anything. A fucking pinata. Something tangible. A god-damned one-legged chicken with shy ovaries. I don't know. At least I'd get something in return. But I enjoy working hard and having excess paycheck money that I can technically afford to lose flushed down the toilet every so often. Feels like I'm working for a sadistic charity that runs solely off of my disappointment in myself and the faint hope of dying dreams. And that's just fine and dandy. At least somebody's benefiting from my loss. Even if it's AlgoBot S/N007684776435668 in some billionaire's trust fund.

Sometimes if I buy puts on an individual stock, it doesn’t want to drop (like MSFT who hasn’t been affected by the recent correction as much).  So buying puts/calls on the indices is a safe play

Otherwise if you really want that volatility, puts on SQ, AMZN, FB, and maybe AAPL are all solid individual stock-plays in my opinion. ",DeMayon,wallstreetbets,4.0

40k AMZN calls Friday EOD closed yesterday for 25k profit

13k AAPL calls Friday EOD closed yesterday for 6k profit

22k AMZN puts at highest point of the day. Closed for 17k profit

Currently holding: 36k AMZN 1650 puts 1/18. Feel like we aren't done drilling. Their up 7k since I bought them at 3pm.

&amp;#x200B;

Recent losses that I held from yesterday:

17k SOXL calls that I dumped at open for -7k 

10k PCG calls that I dumped around 2:30 for -$500

10k BABA calls that I dumped at open for -1.5k

&amp;#x200B;

Overall it's been a pretty good 3 days. If yesterday's rally not only couldn't sustain, but also had all of its gains erased I think we haven't seen the worst. Trump would have to make incredible progress with China (doubtful short term) or JPow would have to keep rates neutral again (no idea on that, if you have insight please share)

2,2018-12-11,"As a marketer, let me chime in.   


1.) It's very possible this could be a great advertising source for Amazon, however...  


2.) Attribution is extremely difficult for print/tv ads. That's not going to stop GEICO from plastering $400mm worth of ads all over, but in order to be a real juggernaut with advertising you need to be able to measure your Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) so you can determine the ROI of the effort.   


3.) You do realize that Amazon has built one of the largest online advertising platforms in the world, right? Most people on the outside-looking-in have no idea how hard AMZN is going at Adwords for POS purchases. The largest shopping site in the world turning every seller into an advertiser just to get the same traffic they used to get for free.   


\---   


I don't disagree on your take with print as far as having a built-in model ready to monetize. Clearly, they're on top of it and GEICO is just the type of brand-dollar advertiser you want ""testing"" it out for millions of dollars. ",finlyn,wallstreetbets,2.0

and then the price moves in your favor and you want to protect your profits but can't sell your option OR want to see if you can squeeze more profit out of it, you open a spread by selling the next strike down (for puts) or next strike up (for calls)

here i sell the 12/14 AMZN 1570P for $21.5

5,2018-12-12,"I mean, that's simplifying it, but almost. There was this thing we used to do, called DD. It meant we studied individual stocks, because back in the before time the market didn't move as one. What would happen was you'd start to notice cycles. Some of the best meme stocks became that way, like V, MSFT, AAPL, and AMZN. Shit, even FB at one point. Once you figured out the cycle you wait for the entry point. You see entry point, you buy for 3 months out. Then you wait. 2 months in, you cash in for tendies. This was the extent of long term investing. For short term fun you pick a weekly FD or two and gamble on those, buying on Monday and selling on Thursday. More often than not the conversation on Fridays was around which one had earned the most, since they had all gone up in some way. It was an innocent time, and it made me believe that I was good at this. It turns out any idiot can be good at this when all it does is go up. Then February happened, and made a lot of people realize that this shit don't always go up. I learned some lessons then, but then we pretty much went back to business as usual. This feels different, because of the massive trading channel and the length of time. February was quick and violent, but then we started going up again.

9,2018-12-12,"AMZN isn't really a run of the mill tech company. They can use their massive cash flow to enter a new market, run at a loss for longer than the competition, once they're a monopoly they can charge whatever they want because any new market entrant can be crushed by merely dropping profitability to zero or negative plus they now have a de facto first-mover advantage.

So all that to say, yes, they'll have a billion percent per year profit forever--until the EU and DOJ step in...if they step in. Of course, they could just pull a Microsoft and save their competition like MSFT did to prevent AAPL from going to the dustbin of history. It would be wiser to just give them a very small share, though--maybe not build them into the world's largest company by enterprise value.

TL;DR AMZN is a marketing company instead of a tech company. Also, it's a massive tax scam which evades taxes for the ultra-wealthy because you're not bothered with dividends which are positively stupid from a value perspective and all the capital gains are stepped up to current basis on death which permits massive intergenerational wealth transfer which is exempt from estate taxes and federal taxes.",BikiniATroll,wallstreetbets,9.0

20,2018-12-11,"Hijacking this thread to tell one more fun little story. Warning! This is a cautionary tale.


In early October 2018, I had become more disillusioned with the stock market than ever before.  Money was becoming more and more abstract; It was becoming nothing more than a collection of numbers on a screen. Likewise, the market felt like a mythical beast that was toying with me for the sake of its own enjoyment. It laughed at my every move. I bought AMZN calls. The market went down one percent and the calls subsequently lost 70%. I bought the dip the for a good discount. 287 SPY calls would do the trick, I thought. The market went down another 1% the following day. Seeing my mistake, I sold those calls and went YOLO into SPY puts. $12,000 deep. $10,000 on SPY 287P 11/9. $2,000 on SPY 285P 10/19. The date of purchase was 10/08. Immediately after YOLOing the market reversed course. The beast was laughing at me once more. The puts lost 25% into close. $9,000 left. Monday evening felt bad. I had lost money on calls, changed to puts, and continued to lose money on puts. Perfectly wrong. The beast kept laughing. Tuesday rolled around and pretty much nothing happened. Wednesday. Wednesday…


I had 2 very lucid dreams on Tuesday night. I dreamt that I woke up, checked my phone, and saw the reckoning. 90% loss. Ouch. I knew it. You’re retarded. Of course that was going to happen, you idiot! Those were the thoughts that dream-state me had. I was distraught.


Moments later, I had another dream. I dreamt that I woke up, checked my phone, and saw the moonshot. My account was up 500%. $50,000! Wow I can’t believe it fucking worked! I smiled. The beast had been defeated!


I woke up, checked my phone, and my fingerprint reader wasn’t working. My hand was too sweaty in anticipation that my phone couldn’t unlock. Every attempt to dry my hands was to no avail. Fuck it! I’ll Google “spy stock” and see if I should even bother. The result came back with the SPY down nearly 2% and the trajectory was straight down to the fucking floor. A rush of adrenaline flowed over me. I had a massive bet on downies and the market was down! I was absolutely exalted. When my finger dried up, I saw the glory. +140%. Wow! The account was touching $20,000 again, swinging wildly back to $15,000, and then working its way back to $18,000. This was happening in a span of seconds. Thousands of dollars made and lost. In seconds. I sold. Decided to “not be greedy” and got the fuck out around $17,500. Phew! That was crazy, I thought. I’ll wait for the market to stabilize and plan my next move with hopefully a little less risk.


Midday rolled around and the market had flattened out. Okay, it looks like the panic has subsided. The beast had been weakened but he was not dead. Not by a long shot. AMZN calls were down 85%. Maybe we will see a bounce, I thought. $13,000 on AMZN uppies. So far in the money that the beast couldn’t possibly hurt them. The beast crawled deep into the cave where those poor uppies were sleeping and he fucking devoured them. The power hour market sell-off commenced. AMZN tanked into close. $17,500 became $6,000. I was embarrassed and also shell-shocked.


The next day, $6,000 was down to $1,500. And I was officially rekt. If my phone could never be unlocked to sell those puts… Worse yet, if I got into a random car accident and was hospitalized for 2 measly days… my account would have reached the promised land. Break-even, which would have been around $45,000 at the time. But then what would I have gambled on next?

800 down on AAPL

400 down on AMZN (this is a lotto ticket with 12/21 exp)

200 down on TWTR

400 down on NVDA

200 down on QQQ

Simplest thing is to use... *drum roll* options! But not to yolo. To actually hedge. If you're going long, get put protection. If you're going short, get a call to cover your ass.

It's typical to spend about 5-10% of a position on hedging. For example, a Dec 21 call contract on AMZN at $1625 costs around ~$6,000. That's a lot of money. But if you're shorting AMZN at around that number, you're talking about $160,000. So for 3.75% you can save your ass from being destroyed by unfavorable movements ",FireSail,wallstreetbets,45.0
