The variances among them are crazytown -- just as they are for all companies. Further, when you see low PEs is it a value? Literally no one knows. I've seen PEs of 5 go to 2 and sit there for years; I've seen PEs of 65 go to 90 in days; I've seen PEs of 120 go to 170 -- obviously that had to come down right? Wrong, fuck us, it shot up to 180 and sat for weeks...then, fuck us again, 210 for a few months.

Look at all the companies that operate at little to no profit. The free money spiggot will be turned off when rates rise and/or consumers stop spending due to recession, job losses.

But I picked Apple because it was cheap and historically big dips are good buying opportunities with them.  But more importantly if they don’t rally I am bag holding a decent company that probably won’t go much lower and I can hold for a few years and wait for 5g or something to move it back up over 200.

I can tell you that I’m actually thinking of long term gains and this year and the next is going to perfect for scooping cheap shares of companies like SQ, AAPL, NVDA, WMT, AMZN, MSFT, GOOG.

11,2019-02-05,"Same. Now, I'll usually buy just OTM, and if I play earnings it'll be spread on multiple companies instead of doing DDs on just one company, seems to spread the risk well. I've learned to accept that the market is random and not to have 'faith' in a company. So, roll the dice on 3 or 4 companies 1 month out slightly OTM, and it seems that maybe one or two will tank but if I'm lucky one will pump up 6%+ post-earnings and make up for it all. So far I've been lucky. INTC and MSFT were bad bets, and they seem to have mostly recovered. I also started riding pre-earning pumps, selling at close.

A lot of it was also learning to be able to close positions. It's so easy to bag a bunch of calls only to never lock in the profits.

Also, I gave up playing puts. It's just too hard, and they decline too quickly in value compared to calls. That really helped. With all this I now feel like I'm mostly in control out my portfolio and I don't feel like the next day I'm gonna lose it all on some stupid bet.

[GOOGL:](https://i.imgur.com/uOU2zNy.png) Pretty close to a bearish engulfing candle and closed below the 200 MA. Support in the 1106 range, look to short if it drops below. 

[AMZN:](https://i.imgur.com/CdiNHae.png) Looks extremely bearish. Bearish engulfing candle as well as a close below the uptrend line. Expecting a lot more selling tomorrow and see what it does with 1600 support. 

[And a recap of QQQ:](https://i.imgur.com/iOYUaGj.png) Daily chart isn't very telling, but today we actually saw some selling with volume (though volume was really anemic between lunch and the last minute before close, very weird). Opened near the 200 MA, got rejected hard and dropped to 170ish and bounced hard but made 3 lower highs.

Adderall is great for research, prep, making a gameplan and measuring your risk before the market starts.

But once it does you need to be in a calmer, more zen state. You have to be objective, flexible, and able to shift in and out between longer and shorter time frames. Adderall, once your adrenaline gets pumping, causes your lizard brain to overwhelm you. You take huge positional risks, get over confident or conversely get gripped by panic and fear. 

I'll give examples. At one point near the bottom of this market I loaded up and bought LEAPS calls on AMZN at $1400, MSFT $100, AAPL $155, and BA $300. Then a lil while later Tim Cook opened his mouth about upcoming earnings disappointments and I dumped everything. I was on adderall when I dumped and completely regretted it.

Another big problem is chasing. I was in on pot stocks earlier this year and adderall warped my view that things would keep going up forever. If a stock went down, I kept throwing more and more money at it hoping to average down and cash out big. I didn't. I got burnt.

I don't disagree that adderall makes it more fun but please for the love of Shkreli know your psychology before you trade on it.",FireSail,wallstreetbets,21.0

0,2019-02-10,"If you buy and sell within 30 days, you cannot deduct if net loss, it is instead incorporated into the p/l of later purchase of security. Easier to understand with an example: if you owned 100 shares of aapl and have say $1000 loss on it currently and you decide to sell all shares realizing the $1000 loss. The wash rule would apply if you repurchase aapl stock (or similar security ie aapl option) within 30 days of that initial sale. So if you bought 25 shares of aapl 20 days after realizing that $1000 loss, and decided to hold for a couple of years that initial $1000 loss would be incorporated into the p/l of that 25 share you bought; you would not be able to deduct the $1000 from the tax year it was realized. So if that lot of 25 shares netted $5,000 gain you would deduct the initial, $1,000 from the $5,000; paying taxes on a $4,000 gain. You avoid the wash rule by not buying aapl within 30 days of selling. Use this for tax purposes at end of year, and buy a stock that moves similarly to aapl (e.g., MSFT),  then repurchasing aapl once the 30 days has passed. Rule applies for options as well, trading on indices gives benefit of marked to market and avoids and wash rules. Hope this helps.",Elna_Fybbg,wallstreetbets,0.0

I found someone with a 75% rating overall (he is right about price/direction 3 of every 4 picks) with a $75/share price target  for MSFT at 12 months.

So I was curious and I looked into it.  As can be seen [here]( https://imgur.com/YCKTuzK) he recommended selling when MSFT was at $41/share back in 2015.  And again when it was at $50 6 months later.  And again and again, each time absolutely wrong at the 12 month range, often proven wrong within a week.  39 times in the last 4 years.

Fewer new sign-ups go to AWS, and more leave AWS for the others. That said, AWS is indeed the best in terms of capabilities (read: most offerings). Most who don't use AWS want some specific service that only MSFT or GOOG offer (e.g. ASP.NET or FireBase/FireStore).    
    
Lastly, transferring is easier than ever with things like Kubernetes, Docker, Bitnami, etc. Most companies I've worked with the last few years can switch with a few terminal commands.

There are more people that leave MSFT for Google GCP or AWS because MSFT Azure has issues with stability in production. 

Most companies settle with one of the main 3 cloud providers and won’t leave unless absolutely necessary. Transitioning to a new cloud takes a long time to make sure everything works. 

Most companies actually prefer to leverage multiple cloud providers to mitigate risk of service outages at a cloud provider / region. 

Of the three AWS is the most reliable followed closely by GCP and Azure is farther behind. Azure is known to release and push things out too quickly without testing. Documentation is poor and frequently outdated. 

Azure isn’t bad though. They’re still leagues ahead of other cloud providers outside the top 3. Oracle is just straight dumpster fire.

Find a company that has good potential or want fall off the face of the Earth (such as MSFT). Then, learn TA. Despite all of wsb shitting on it, if you do it with a company that has good fundamentals and do it for a short time, it can work.

I do this on MU, NOC, MSFT, V, PYPL and TSLA Its worked for me. The s&amp;p 500 is up 6% in the past six months. Using this (and admittedly options with TA), I've gotten 30% return so far.

In the business I work in, information can be classified as “this is how we do it” and “this is for reference only”.

If you’re doing a task that is repetitive and highly standardized, let’s say installing a part on an vehicle, you have a “this is how you do it” document.

Then let’s say you are doing something that isn’t perfectly defined, let’s say you’re trying to root cause a problem.  For this you have educational or guiding material, or what I would call “this is for reference only”.  This isn’t telling you what to do, just something to consider.

Sorefreshing posts are just that.  Showing you what to consider and how to play it.

When you open a position, it’s your responsibility, 100%.  The strikes, the expirations, the type of option(s), when you open, if you close it to prevent total lose, if you close to lock in gains.  It’s all on you.

People need to stop complaining about him, or he’s going to leave, and I wouldn’t blame him.  There are a couple users here I see “that was sorefreshing kiss of death lolol” come on.  He even said this week was a wild card.  If anyone told you AAPL would be sub $200 this week, or MSFT lower than pre-ER, or ROKU would be up 20%+ or any number of big movements we’ve seen you would’ve said no fucking way last week.

Earnings plays can be good but risky.  Consider buy-writes or spreads to collect premiums.

Depending on account size, you may have to do more than one stock and or strike/expiry or else you could be all of the open interest.

I wouldn't chase IV as it could go against you bigly and drop more than the premium you collect... especially with tariff man.

Regarding the security threat thing, modern telecom equipment is by it's nature a security threat. The only reason Huawei is getting hit for that is due to their history of aiding (and legal requirement to aid) the Chinese government in espionage.

\- Collect GME tendies ... maybe ... depending on price action heading into earnings. These are leaps I bought during low IV, so if my puts don't pump I'll hold until the market realizes this turd ain't pivoting.

\- Watch my X puts go ITM again when Trump undermines China narrative ( a man can dream).

\- Buy HEXO shares if it stabilizes, though the PE of weed stocks in general are slightly terrifying, especially given the saturated market. But hey, my micro account isn't for slow sustainable growth (YOLO). I'll buy enough to sell covered premium.

\- Maintain cash so I can re-buy SPY puts on this bounce ... don't fight the trend (and yet I continue to do it with LYFT).

0,2019-06-06,"To be honest, I am leaning towards Case 1 and 2 for this current situation. There is no denying that the market is bound to recover now (every market recovery starts with a random spike up), but here's my rationale for my opinion on this issue. FYI I am currently holding calls at this moment:

* **Mexico tariff goes into effect**

Yes, we have all heard it. Mexico will be paying for that damn wall and Trump will ensure that will happen. With re-elections coming in 2020 and with assurances to Trump that ""rates cut will be justified depending on circumstances"", it's extremely certain that Trump will be emboldened to continue with his aggressive trade policy with other countries in order to get what he wants. Feds dropping rates will help to wane off any temporary economic slowdown, and Trump needs the stock market and the economy on his side ASAP before he becomes another one-term president.

* **The market goes down,** ***but high volatility expected***

Now, this is where things get interesting. Mexican tariffs are expected, and this will probably cause a few red days before everything corrects itself. Those who have bought puts may count their blessings, although it will be extremely difficult to time this market and you risk losing your capital overall. However, the Feds will be inclined to take a more aggressive stance from here on out (they lost their patience stance in the previous episode) and everything will start to hail under Newton's Third Law of Motion.

China tariff committee will commence on June 17, Feds speech will be on June 19 and Trump meeting Xi at the G20 meeting summit is somewhere around late-end June. Tariff committee will likely list several hot industries to target (smartphones, laptops, technology and software) for the remaining $300B Chinese exports and this will ultimately see the downfall of numerous high-tech stocks (looking at ya, AAPL MSFT and NVDA). People might be inclined to hold puts then, but hold your horses - **you don't ever bet against the Feds**. 

* **Fed cuts rate**

Feds will likely announce a rate cut OR voice a more aggressive stance towards a rate cut (which admit it, this recession is over). Huge chaos will ensue once more (Fed talks v. China tariffs) just like now (Fed talks v. Mexico tariffs), but the market trend will still be upwards (technical rebound, fundamentals will change from here on out). This will be the final blow towards the recession, as Trump meeting Xi amidst the chaos to if not resolve the trade war, **at least propose to hold a meeting for further discussion**. This will be the icing on the cake, and even if Chinese talks stall - the Feds are bound to drop rates by then (July, 70%).

*So, what does this tell us?*

1. A bear market is not as strong as we perceived it to be. Trade wars will come, yes, but Trump is running out of time and it is apparently clear that China intends to stall talks if they don't have it their way.
2. Even if a trade war and a recession do happen (unlikely), the Feds will be prepared for this event and will take drastic and radical measures to help combat the economic slowdown.
3. The market has been oversold for a while now. Sales and profits are still driving this market and a SPY crash grows increasingly uncertain over time.
4. That being said, **do not go havoc and buy calls immediately**. This market has yet to recover, and while tough days are going to be no more, there are still a few traps that people may accidentally fall into. We have so many good days ahead of us.

0,2019-06-07,"Actually it is a lot more complex than just the futures. These big fund managers use future contracts as a ""hedge"" for the most part but the futures can also indicate general market sentiment before cash open. 

They buy or sell indexes like XLF(financials), SMH(Semiconductors), XLT(Technology) which are the three key indexes that directly affect price of SPY. Then they can also buy sell one of the monster constituents of SPY individually to affect SPY price. SPY has 500 stocks, but it is not equal weighted. BA, AMZN, AAPL, FB, MSFT, GOOGL are one of the biggest constituents by market cap. If someone wants to tank SPY, selling one or two of these stocks so they are down a lot for one day will directly affect SPY and prevent it from rallying, even causing it to go red. Same applies for financials XLF. In order for a perfect SPY rally to happen, financials techs and semis should all run. Then there is the whole bond market, example ETF would be TLT. If those rally, financials tank and thus SPY tanks. 

Market makers always hedge and have neutral positions so they make money on either case. Correct, options pricing does not fluctuate based on how many options contract are bought. Options pricing depends on the usual underlying stock's implied move (IV), stock price and expiry. But when market tanks, and volatility picks up it juices up the options pricing.",uninfinity,wallstreetbets,0.0

I think the smart thing to do is close today and see what happens this weekend and possibly buy back in Monday.  I might miss some gap up pre market, but MSFT usually only moves maybe 0.5% at most...

I mainly write MSFT covered calls with margin or do diagonal spreads.  The covered calls is what really makes my traded amount look large, but for long options it's probably no more than what you're doing.

My main spreads are MSFT and DIS.  I write weeklies to get a little more premium and to support the wsb community.

And the stocks I use these strategies on, well, I have what might be a slightly naive approach. I mostly do tech stocks which I know are good. In the sense, I first make sure their financials are healthy and/or they're consistently growing (PLAN was an example of this). Then I do something very subjective, I judge them based on my personal impression of what they produce. For example MSFT, PLAN, DATA etc are tech companies which I know are growing and make excellent products which are everywhere. TEAM fit into this group too, but O sadly never put money there. Slightly naive, but I'm hoping to learn to evaluate financials in a more sophisticated way and maybe, just maybe, study how to use technicals.

43,2019-07-08,"It’s a 2% tax on wealth you have over $50 million, and another 1% on wealth over $1 billion.  My guess is 1 or 2 of us here would be impacted (if the people are telling the truth, which to be honest I don’t really care if they are or not).

The most detailed proposal I saw exempted your primary residence (presuming up to a certain dollar value, but it didn’t specify) and your 401(k).

So if you had a TDA (or RH account) with over $50 million in AAPL or AMZN or MSFT or whatever, then each year you’d need to shell out $1 million a year.  Lately those companies have managed to do that, but you would need to sell shares, find cash elsewhere, or maybe write options against those shares to make sure you could cover it.

Supposedly it’s to help ensure that people with extreme wealth pay “fair” taxes.  We can argue fairness and equality on other subs, but from what I can see it would incentivize you to make sure that money makes decent returns… or to hide it even harder.

Compliance would likely be challenging overall, people would find ways to have homes/boats/planes/whatever by difficult to track entities, but trading accounts would be easy as they already report holdings/gains/losses to the government.

The proposals that would actually impact WSBers is the tax per transaction some senators have proposed.  Maybe 0.5% of the total value of each transaction.  Let’s say you buy $10k worth of call options expiring in a week because you think it’s going up big.  Then they drop to $1k a day later, you sell.  You pay $50 the first time, then $5 when you close the position.  Or you’re a baller and you buy $1,000,000 in shares, so that’s $5,000.  Then a year later shit went up like 1% and is now worth $1,010,000 but you’re tired of holding so you unload it, but that costs you $5,050.

33,2019-07-10,"&gt;1) You think that a short position on MSFT is solid, due in part to your view on their EOL software and how it is licensed.

Long dated, at least 2 years out, yeah. Depends on how the 2020 elections go.

And I wouldn't call it ""MSFT's licensing"" - it's more like the SC/Federal courts haven't ruled shit on the legality of EULAs. It's a billion dollar problem that's never been covered.

&gt;2) You cannot take this position however, because even though you work in a decent field for 15+ years, you're ""a poor.""

I *wouldn't*, even if I could, because there are better ways to spend my time and money. I would much rather do many other things with the funds. Probably get some vacation time.

&gt;You really could've gotten that out differently, my man. 

It's a deliberate strategy. Most people with your kind of post history (a lack of capitalization, memes, usually one sentence responses) double down, and then I block them and mark them down as ""cattle"", along with 8000+ other people on my blocklist.

&gt;4) The outcome of this conversation might be more important to you.

The strain of my particular autism is, well, stressful. I have a habit of going to the mat *really* fast when someone says something willfully ignorant or just plain fucking braindead. 

Couple this with the 10x as many lurkers as there are posters on reddit, and well, being inflammatory or at least taking a hardline approach gets to the core of people's character in 3 posts as compared to a 20 day 18 comment chain.

The side effect of being so enthusiastic about your beliefs is that writing long ass posts becomes relatively easy, so instead of me simply writing ""well MSFT's EULA is likely unenforcable"" and that's it, you get a few literal examples, my background, and all of a sudden I go from a random nobody with a one sentence piece of potentially obvious knowledge to someone that's got a thesis and supporting evidence. It makes particular people care about what you have to say, especially if they actually go through the trouble of reading the entire post, despite being offended or insulted.

2) You cannot take this position however, because even though you work in a decent field for 15+ years, you're ""a poor.""

You wrote, what, like 10 sentences, which all rehash the same point: ""nobody's going to sue MSFT if their Windows install that's EOL (according to MSFT), or if they DO sue, they'll lose"".

You have NO legal sources to back up your point. You have no case studies. You have no cited cases. You have no practical anecdotes of IT stories relating to hacks/open source projects. You have no historical context. You don't even have ""expert opinion"".

You're not submitting ""relevant information"", you're submitting your basic bitch random internet opinion without sources. You might as well be some crackhead with a penchant for reddit and the ability to type relatively well, as far as I can tell.

&gt; You're screaming about a tangent. 

No, the original fucking point about this was ""MSFT should open source their EOL shit because otherwise it's going to be fucking hacked"". 

I then gave at least 2, plausible, likely ***literal*** examples of ***exactly that happening***. That's not a ""tangent"", that's called ""explaining the point"". Not my fault your reading comprehension skills are worse than a 4th grader's.

&gt;How does all of what you said relate to the stock price? 

From the third sentence of my post:

&gt;All it takes is one Washington Post story of Microsoft refusing to support one Windows CE install on a Cali/NYC/major utility infrastructure that was then hacked by the Russians/Chinese/NK for the Dems to launch a congressional inquiry as to why Microsoft is braindead. 

And the sixth:

&gt;And then the stock dives 10% in a week. 

===============================

&gt; Which position have you taken on the stock?

I'd short them if I could. That should be fucking obvious. I can't, because I'm a poor. However, you've gone from arguing the point to moving the goalposts, and well, you've essentially conceded the argument because of it.

&gt; Do you honestly think that MSFT is one lawsuit from tumbling stock?

Considering that WSB fucking thinks Disney is headed for the moon when it went up 10% overnight, and that ""the end is near"" when SPY drops 3% in a day, yeah, I'd call that ""tumbling"".

17,2019-07-11,Open interest and option volume are all that matters when it comes to difficulty selling options. MSFT is a highly liquid stock and you will never have liquidity issues. Most options have more volume the closer they are to expiration.,Deathduck,wallstreetbets,17.0
18,2019-07-11,"Let's run through this.

If you bought a $4 LEAPS on MSFT, you're talking 19 June 2020 $160c for $4.40.

Now 5 days days to expiration if those are worth $4.50 a piece on 15 June 2020, MSFT share price would need to be about $162 (or so).  On a heavily traded stock like MSFT you will almost NEVER have issues with unloading an ITM option even the day of expiration.

Where you might have some liquidity issues (and wider bid/ask spread) is with a LEAPS is let's say in 3 months those options are ""worth"" $5.50.  Not because MSFT has gone up and they're ITM, but MSFT has gone up enough to cause them to be more valuable.  You might have some difficulty getting fair value for them (closer to the ASK price is what a seller would hope for as fair), but again in a stock as heavily traded for MSFT you'll still see sizable appreciation.",Gahvynn,wallstreetbets,18.0
19,2019-07-11,"Not really because if it's a popular stock like MSFT, volume will increase massively as it gets close to expiration if you're anywhere near the stock price.

Just look at July 12 or July 19 options on MSFT.  Sure if you buy those July 19's months in advance, there wouldn't be that much volume or open interest.

&amp;#x200B;

But as you get close to expiration there's tons of volume buying/selling.  Several thousand ATM contracts with near-term expirations trade hands every day for a big stock like MSFT.",zg44,wallstreetbets,19.0

If Adobe and Microsoft ATM calls both have deltas of 0.3, but if Adobe goes up 1%, that’s $3, or 3 more deltas and gammas of movement than ur MSFT goes up 1% which equates to only about $1.40, only about one delta.

I'm not saying it's a bad stock but I can't see weed stocks being the winner in a 2 week simulation. His best bet for highest returns will be calls and puts on the stocks that move a lot in a short time.

OP you should look into earnings reports this week and next week and maybe make some option plays on them to get some quick cash and if you run out of option plays you like then park the money in some safe growth stocks until the end so you don't waste any profits and you'll still grow your gains instead of leaving them idle. I would probably also suggest you maybe taking a portion of your starting cash and setting into a few good growth stocks incase your option plays don't go your way so you'll at least have some gains worst case.

If we are still bleeding tomorrow, time to double down and buy more. So long as (uh oh) the market recovers, it’s free money.

The danger is it doesn’t. If this is Bloody May all over again, or worse, Red October, then the above is just gonna hemorage money, so you don’t burn it all. Once the real fall happens, you hold your cash, dump the stuff that was speculative, and ready those bonds.

In awhile we hit bottom, then it’s buy in again. The time to buy is not in a bull, it’s in a bear. It’s free money. It’s just not FDs. You have to think long term.

If you imagine in this scenario that MSFT downtrends after it hits 160, one of the benefits of weeklies becomes clear.

You'd have sold the weekly because you'd have a high return, and it was about to expire anyway.

For  the long dated option the % return would be smaller, so you'd consider  waiting, only to watch your profits disappear until the next uptrend. In  this scenario, you're leaving profits on the table, and they were  smaller profits to begin with. Had you exited the position at the same  time as you would have the weekly, then you'd have paid more for the  same result.

In this respect,  weeklies allow you to take more full advantage of short term price  movement, which will often not be worth taking advantage of when holding  a long dated option.",roguesinthehouse,wallstreetbets,1.0

3,2019-08-03,"It's totally dependent on your strategy (and there are infinite strategies).   

I do weeklies, because I realized that holding long dated options was endlessly tying up my meager funds, and to little benefit. 

With weeklies, I get to the results of my plays faster (and more dramatically), freeing up my funds for the next week. The results will be more variable in the short term, but you're working with the same probabilities as you are in long dated options.   

&amp;#x200B;

For example, if I buy MSFT weeklies every week, then I am holding the equivalent of a long dated MSFT option that is ultra-leveraged.   

Another thing I like about weeklies is that I'm less tempted to hold losers that stay losers forever, or hold winners til they become losers.   

With long dated options I was just watching them go up and down endlessly for months, and I was like... why am I paying a premium, just to draw out this process? Might as well by cheap options that deliver instant results.   

The probabilities become more clear, the strategies become more focused, everything is simpler for me now, and I feel more confident in my strategy.",roguesinthehouse,wallstreetbets,3.0

That's why we're dropping so hard. Sure, we might rally a little one day this week, but we'll keep on dropping unless we get good news from the Fed (unlikely at this exact moment) or trade talks (even more unlikely). Plus, I think people are scared about how Trump will respond. This was a shot across the bow by China that they're not fucking around and Trump doesn't seem the type to easily capitulate.

2. MSFT call (just a solo call.. 137C 8/16). I will evaluate this at EOD monday.
3. DIS calls.. Holding them through earnings. If DIS drops, I will more.. Credit to a user who got banned here and posted somewhere else.
4. MCD calls: I hope these don't get affected heavily by futures.
5. CRON calls. Thinking of diversifying and buying some pot options. /u/RideTheWaveRW . This is looking good on the TA front too.
6. From stock swing trading, I am long on MCD and KL right now.

There's a reason why it dumped harderv recently and a reason why it lost top market cap crown this year.

They have zero chance at growth in the near term without china. 

Pretty much maxed out in US/EU. And hopeless in India. 

YoY declines in their most important lines of revenue. Profit numbers are only beats because of buybacks.

Hmm my moves tomorrow..

Well I was going to play LYFT earnings and had 2 contracts of 67.5 which I cashed out at close and didn't play LYFT earnings. So I am happy since they would have been IV crushed.

STMP: pretty much going to hold both options until expiry (30p and 70c). If they keep their gains, expect a squeeze on STMP.

MSFT calls: 137c fd, will take a call EOD tomorrow to cut or let it run through Friday.

\----------

w.r.t swinging stocks

Swinging AMZN since 1776 (ha tht worked out)

AMD (in at 28.88). Hoping these gains hold and Su Bae showers me with tendies.. might update stops to get the most out of this.

\----------------

No TA or anything: But have a feeling DIS is going to start moving up soon.. Might take 3-4 days.

\-----------------

Ok TIME for some TA... now please bear in mind that this is just TA and one news event or tweet will run this. But if no bad news etc happens..  VISA($V) and MSFT ($MSFT) are looking RIPE to move up after being oversold on many TA indicators (MACD,RSI,Full STO)

\------------------

CNBC broke out the yuan news flipping futures. Lets see what happens. Today's market red to green showed that the market was going through price discovery and might just rip up tomorrow.

\------------------

Some Risky but fun plays for tomorrow if you have a day trade ready and can buy 1-5min into open. Think about it as a MTCH sort of play

1. ROKU calls
2. AVLR calls.

54,2019-08-08,"MSFT ATM call, +1yr DTE (min 1yr). It’s called a leap. It’s a leveraged option, which is already leveraged. Go put it in a back tester.

5% movement in MSFT represented generally 10-20% movement in the leap. This works both up and down, but generally MSFT is growth stock.

Advantages: 
* If MSFT moves against you, you literally have a year for it to move back. 
* You don’t hold it for a year. Repeat after me DO NOT HOLD OPTIONS TO EXPIRY. My leaps last 2-3mths
* It’s leveraged as fuck. Small movements represent big gains, with relatively safe risk (see point 1)

Disadvantage:
* unlike stocks, if msft moves against you and you wait and wait, and it never recovers, you lose it all. See point 2 above. Do not hold it to expiration. Theta will murder you. Seriously, leaps are murdered by theta if you hold them too long. 
* big capital. A leap on MSFT is typically around $1.5k. You actually want to buy slightly ITM. But if you’re confident in the stock, then the risk is more buying power reduction. I typically go for $10k of leaps, but your portfolio will vary.
* Premiums matter, on a good day the leaps are expensive. Wait for a day when MSFT is going down.

Other notes:
* You can only do leaps on limited stocks and get good performance. It has to be well established, BYND even if it had chains that far out would be insane.
* Leaps are very much a set a limit and wait for a fill, do not chase an open and DO NOT DO A MARKET ORDER, FFS SAY NO TO MARKET ORDERS PEOPLE.
* It must be a growth stock (ok technically you could do it on a bear stock, but that’s risky)
* it must have volume. WM is awesome, but there just isn’t the movement. You’re not looking to carry the leap to expiration. You want in and out within a few months at most. Despite WMs growth, the needle just wouldn’t move.
* Be careful with volatile stocks. SPY is a growth stock, but it moves a lot. Way too much. 
* Backtest. If you have access to the tools, run a leap on a stock and see how it performed. That will show you that WM sucks despite growing well, and MSFT printed tendies. It’s also worth seeing how it does over a negative period. I carried leaps over May, they looked ugly as fuck during May, but in June they were clean and green.",NastyTrader,wallstreetbets,54.0

They already signed up 50 of Fortune 1000 companies just in the last quarter and since onboarding enterprises takes around 3-5 months lifecycle by 5 months from now this number could easily triple - all recurring sales along with 10%+ commission for them for every dollar spent by enterprises on hiring employees/freelancers.

They are primed to be acquired by Microsoft ($MSFT) any time soon as they are creating a perfect synergistic portal for LinkedIn for Enterprises to tap into for all their hiring needs whether short term or long term.

12,2019-09-05,"Vega is volatility. The long and short leg of the vertical spread are correspondingly long and short vega, and therefore movements in IV (Implied Volatility) have minimal effects on the position.

Gamma is the second order of Delta but I phrased that part incorrectly. Charm, or the change in Delta in respect to DTE (Days to Expiration), is the correct word to use. Naked calls have a decaying delta over time, which means that huge moves in the underlying have the greatest effect on the option price when you buy the call, and it decreases with every passing day.

https://www.optiontradingtips.com/images/option-charm.gif

On the other hand, vertical spreads have a very low delta far out from expiration, and as expiration approaches delta increases, which is a better tool for targeting specific future dates (cheaper to manage early on).

As for theta, spreads have positive theta as the price approaches and passes the short leg (which would be the upper bound price in a bull call spread). As you can imagine, if your max profit is at 150 and the underlying stock is currently at 160 with 20 DTE, then the position will gain value every day rather than lose value as it becomes more certain that the position will indeed close at max profit.

I can't answer your specific msft question as the msft call value depends on the share price and the strike of the call, which you didn't provide. If the call was close to expiry, then the fall in value was almost certainly theta erasing your extrinsic value in the call.

When you hold a naked call you own profit in every price level from your strike up to infinity. As you can imagine, as expiration approaches, the likelihood of the share price skyrocketing to levels far above your strike decreases at an ever accelerating rate. While there's a small chance for MSFT to hit 150 with 30DTE, there's an impossibly small chance for MSFT to jump to 150 with 2 days left. If your short leg for a bull call spread was at 140, then you never owned this outlandish possibility of profit in the first place and are not subject to its decay.

https://www.projectoption.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ATM_Decay_Curve.svg?x34254)

In general, it's a bad idea to hold naked calls under 30 DTE unless you're strictly looking to capitalize on a parabolic upswing and corresponding IV spike, or they're part of a larger position that has some longer term exposure as well. Sometimes they're also valuable if you think a huge pop will come sometime soon but don't quite know when, and want to ensure you fully capture this movement when it does occur.",mechtech,wallstreetbets,12.0

puts should be on NFLX, APPL,NVIDIA,MSFT,BA all these stonks that raise like bubble since 2016. I'm not talking about meme stonks like uber, snap, etc since they are building their own bubble within themselfs",tepmoc,wallstreetbets,22.0

1,2019-09-07,"&gt; It’s a cheaper alternative to MSFT Azure for CDN but also feels like an over saturated business. 

That's not really what people compare it to in the CDN world.

Cloudflare is great for small/medium websites because it's easy and fast to set up a CDN with SSL and some basic security features.

Microsoft Azure is a huge computing platform competing with AWS, not Cloudflare or AWS CloudFront specifically.

Compared to Akamai and Fastly, Cloudflare is small, for small websites. Akamai and Fastly power the Twitters of the world because they offer more content delivery options which are more advanced and expensive.

As for it being oversaturated, maybe. Every growth market is oversaturated though. Someone has to take a slice of each pie though and I think Cloudflare is the easiest to use if your needs aren't very advanced. 

That being said, I only use their free services and if I needed to pay, I'd go to Fastly and not Cloudflare.",UnhandledPromise,wallstreetbets,1.0

This isn't YouTube boys: Satya saw the vids and realized that Shkreli's autistic use of Excel could be the basis for a new revolutionary Excel function. 

In order to profit off of his genius without having to worry about any sort of poor man's copyright issues he told Sergey, his good old drinking buddy, that he needed a favor: wipe the Pharma Bro's free gifts to aut-mankind out of existence. In exchange, the SBFF would receive an infinitely renewable royalty on all future sales of office in all its variations in perpetuity.

If you want to stand tall for the Pharma Bro boycott XLOOKUP!! When Office tells you they have a new update: you reject that shit. 

Stand with, and for, the Legacy of Shkreli.

Mango tweet, Fox News, online...etc. Its hard to tell if it will work out like the watergate.

Sold 300 136/135 put credit spreads on MSFT over the past two days, averaged down to about 30 bucks a pop or thereabouts--these expire next Friday. Started selling them OTM on the Tuesday drop near 136.50, sold a bunch more for some nice premium ITM on Wednesday while VIX was sky-high and about shit myself on that drop this morning (down about 7k) if I'm being honest. Interestingly though, being on the sell-side of it made my iron hands stronger. I mean... the odds favor you. I've never been down in a single trade as much as I have been with these spreads, but there is a certain confidence that comes with knowing time and volatility are working for you. Works until it doesn't, etc.   


Right now, banking on IV contraction and a retrace to 293-295 to drop these fuckers' value so that I can close sooner than later. It's interesting because I usually go with wider spreads, if at all, but in this case, there was no use in risking more collateral for less return--started selling the OTM puts when it was a buck or two off the strike price. I think overall I have about 25k in collateral locked into this trade and plan on exiting at 25-50% gain, and admittedly, am down 1.6k total at the moment. Downside-wise, I have to get out by Weds. of next week, no matter what. Basically the nuclear option. Not willing to take more than a 8k loss on this overall, as that's what I've made overall with options since starting.   


Sure there is, at worst, some assignment risk, but I can't imagine this spread would be worth any more than it was today--probably hit its peak at the ISM miss--up until its expiration. And sure, Oct. 2019 could legit be bearmageddon and we hit 240, but if there's one thing I've learned trading, is that the contrarian thesis is probably the highest % return (even long term) *IF* you actually could time it properly--I mean, come on. What are the odds that a 5% drop is followed by another down day, even if it has anecdotally happened? (we have to accept that 2018 was an outlier for now). Yes, that sort of thinking wrecks motherfuckers, but you have to have some kind of trade thesis, otherwise you are guaranteed to lose long-term (you can still lose long-term) I guess I'm drunk as fuck right now, but the main idea is that theta gang can be a god damn rush too and while the risk and return ratios are literally inverted, there is safer money to be made on that snail trail. Or lost. Fuck if I know.",excadedecadedecada,wallstreetbets,4.0

It was a dumb thing to do since I’d initially wanted to have them called away to clear the $100k margin amount to own them. Lesson to everyone: stick to your plan!

I’m getting greedy looking at call premiums, so I’ll continue to sell close to the money calls until I’m called away (ideally), or I’ve made enough to cover the margin amount (which should only take.... 83 weeks by my reckoning...).

Or I’ll sell a really deep itm Oct 24 $70c for $71 or whatever and have that $70k to reduce my margin borrowing cost.

I started trading stocks in 2009 buying penny stocks. Made 900% on 2 days on my first trade. Thought I was a genius. Turns out I was just lucky. 

I started trading options in 2013 while drunk as shit. Bought a call and made 1,000% on that play. Thought I was brilliant. Tried it again and lost 100% on the next trade. 

Here’s my advice: get $10,000. Sell at the money cash-covered puts on MSFT and use the premium to buy FDs on whatever stock you like. Keep using “the wheel” strategy (google it if your unfamiliar) to collect premium, and use the proceeds for FDs. You’ll get rich with lower risk.

3,2019-11-02,"market is too irrational. watch it soar to new ATHs that only CNBC's talking heads can justify. any time it drops the fed comes in to save the day. Trump trade cycle is over. trade war was a distraction. so is the impeachment news that has taken front seat over the economic front, which will lead up to 2020 election. wtf is an inverted yield curve? wtf cares is what.

asset prices will continue to rise beyond reasonable means. largest US tech companies, AAPL, MSFT, etc. will continue with absurd stock valuations because this is the true economy in their minds -- the continued enrichment of the ultra wealthy and the elimination of the middle class, so long as the fed serves the mandate of full employment. it'll just keep printing money as the fuel and engine of the Trump economy. 

where it was once the norm for twenty-year-olds to buy housing and begin adult lives at adult ages, living with mom and dad has become normalized and will only get worse. they say they will move out when housing prices drop, when pay increases and real jobs can be had outside of almost pure influence. after inflation, the median US salary in the 50s - 70s is equal to something like $40 / hour today. the going wage (even when economy argues that wages are high) is $16 - $18? not factoring in the increased cost of living, asset prices, student loan obligations, etc. I don't see millinials moving out from their parents' houses any time soon, or reverting to previous norms. housing affordability is not limited to the US by any means. 

if all bubbles pop, what pops this obvious bubble -- the largest US economic expansion in history? This expansion also includes the largest homeless population in US history, which wasn't at all usual less than a decade ago. Now there are tent cities and skid rows in every major US city that people enjoy ignoring.

is the trump economy the last straw that leads to US socialism, from which we are already hearing the cries of? when debts can't be repaid and government doesn't have the money due to massive deficits and exhaustive fed money printing, the remaining idea is wealth redistribution from the ultra wealthy. is Bezos going to start handing out checks at no cost? he is currently working on bringing visions of establishing low orbit space colonies where people work and vacation as secondary ecosystems (blue origin mission). that's how much fucking money these people have.

21,2019-11-04,"Here is the biggest question on my mind, let me know if I'm stupid. Say he used this leveraged position to buy a much more \*likely\* option (E.g. a call that MSFT or GOOG would go up at least a $1 within 3 days). Would that be a relatively easy/less risky way to materialize the $50k glitch and cash out? Sure, this option isn't going to be worth a as much, but considering the fact that most the funds are not his to begin with, he can just exercise the call the moment the stock reaches the strike price and immediately find himself $50k richer, right? This is still a gamble of course, but to me it seems not nearly as much of a gamble as what he did. I figure why not fly under the radar with this glitch, cash out the position and move on.

RH still needs to fix this but he totally could have taken advantage of the glitch in a way that neither him nor RH lost and walk away with the winnings while they close that insane margin loophole, right? With this scenario, sure RH probably can't come after him for more than the federally allowed 25% or whatever it is.

This is literally gambling with extra steps. You'll have a much better time learning to play Poker. Bunch of Indian Casinos are 18+. The buy in to even have a good time playing options is at least 10x what you have saved up. You can afford at most two decent plays.

I remember being 18 and having no money. The idea of getting ""rich"" quick was very appealing but if it was so easy, everyone would be driving lambos. You are way better off going to the personalfinance sub which actually has good advice for someone in your current situation. All you have to do is start a vanguard account and just dump as much money as you can in some growth fund. Stonks literally only go up over time which you have a lot of. If you're feeling nuts just make your own memestock portfolio with TSLA MSFT DIS AMD AAPL. A few hundred bucks into those stocks a month.

4,2019-11-09,"Correct. I don't really do spreads, although on ROKU or TSLA it'd probably be mandatory. I wheel my way through ROKU and am in the hole all-time, but I rely on a constant stream of hopium to keep me going.

For DIS or MSFT I don't do spreads because they're generally slow enough and by the time I catch it, the most I would lose is a few hundred dollars. Most binary events for those are theoretically known (JEDI was assumed before December to one of the two, DIS+ stupidly ignored by everyone but Disney Kid).",soccergoon13,wallstreetbets,4.0
5,2019-11-09,"Slow blue chips (MSFT, DIS) and then go against trend. Both have frequent up-down cycles where it's pretty obvious how to play the channel.

Today was the first time I lost on MSFT calls, because it had the run up after noon (!?) that sent my 145c from .04 to .64.

I'm ok losing on puts of whatever because I am ok owning shares if need be.

ROKU is the most lucrative thing to play (probably TSLA or BYND also), but it's easy to lose on it because it has no predictable pattern",soccergoon13,wallstreetbets,5.0

2,2019-11-10,"As a paper boy I bought a bunch of random stocks during the early dot com hype days and never sold. I found a reciept recently for a stock trade of around $2000 of AAPL at a price between $20-30. I’ve never sold. Due to various stock splits during that time my investment webpage has my purchase price at ~$2. 

At the time of course AAPL was a basket case and I have no idea why I bought it. Perhaps I read some article about Steve Jobs coming back? I have no idea. My uncles who worked in tech both figured Apple was dead and I was an idiot.

For a long while I’ve resultantly had ~$100k in AAPL, though in the last short while that spiked to $140k. At some point I moved some shares to Canada’s new tax free savings account, and while I meant to diversify, not doing that turned out to be a happy accident. That USD$33k of AAPL is now up ~100% and worth CAD$ 90k.

I basically got ultra lucky with AAPL in particular but in general I picked good ones during that time, perhaps due to being a bit conservative since as a paper boy I didn’t have that much money, I stuck with the bigger companies instead of stuff like Pets.com. MSFT was another purchase around that late ‘90s time that paid off, as was EBay and Google (Tho I sold google at $600 whoops).",mukmuk64,wallstreetbets,2.0

I know we YOLO all our money here, but you really shouldn't YOLO more than 5% of your portfolio on a single trade if you want to unlock the green Robinhood app. I typically do weekly spreads for ER or a month out on news. And I like to do ATM. That way I break even, or maybe even earn a little, if the price is flat through expiration. I prefer put credit spreads. If you do OTM, you can lower the breakeven, so you can actually earn money even if it drops a little, but your max risk is higher and max profit is lower. You have to determine what's within your risk tolerance. After a couple botched spreads where I held too long, I take profit once I hit 60% or a loss at -50%.

All credit spreads. Mine are pretty much 50/50 and centered on binary events, which is risky as fuck but reward is huge. I wanna take on a less risky strategy so I can actually start making money.

2. Set a profit/loss limit and stick to it. I hit -20%, I sell and buy into the current trend. I hit +20%, I sell and roll up, locking in profits. Chances are slim youll time the top or bottom. The trend is your friend is a saying for a reason.

* What is a company's market cap and why is that more important than share value? Most people who start investing look at the price per share and think that is the indicator on a size of a company. But MSFT's stock is like $146 and AMZNs is $1780, and yet MSFT is worth $300 Billion more.

* What is an ETF and what is an Index Fund? If you don't want to pick specific companies to buy shares on, you can buy aggregate holdings of entire sectors. Such as Technology, or Finance, etc..

* What is Capital Gains and how is that taxed differently than Income, and what exactly do I pay taxes on when I make money on the stock market?

* What factors affect a stock's price? You'll start checking the news far more often after you start actively investing. [For instance, here is all the recent news about Microsoft that can actively affect its stock price](https://www.google.com/search?q=%24msft&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS845US845&amp;tbm=nws&amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNTrpnvhLYb2pFCxZYIbuIeMMfaRDw:1573585409812&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwionYC7ruXlAhWqrVkKHfLwCIAQ_AUIDygC&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=1007&amp;dpr=1)

&gt; Microsoft or Apple would be highly unlikely to go to zero for the foreseeable future

This is accurate, however, the risk to reward is pretty good in some of the cases OP mentioned.

Plus they are weeklies. Even these guys probably aren't going to $0 in 10 trading days, lol. 

For example, the $4 AUPH. Collect $0.9 premium in 2 weeks. I only lose if the stock hits pretty much its 52 week low. 

They aren't reporting earnings before that. They are supposed to report drug tests for clinical trials but that's by 12/31. So we are probably safe before 12/20.

These require very amounts of collateral cash compared to selling puts on MSFT.

0,2019-12-03,"Here's my opinion, for what it's worth: 

I re-read 10/30 earnings and analyst opinions and my initial reaction came back - meh. I was surprised it gapped and ran up close to $12 this past month. On a side note, every week when I talk to my father he asks me 'What do you think about GE?"" That tells me he bought some stock, but he's a buy and hold kinda guy. Shit, he's got MSFT since $25. So, based on him, I think long term it might be a buy, but I'm looking for a trade &amp; not looking long term with this right now.

Anyway, I've been waiting for a downturn in GE and think we're in the middle of it. I think the perfect time to have bought puts was last Wednesday, but I wasn't watching and missed it. However, I think there's still some meat on the bone and looking for a dip to $10.70.  Then, if it doesn't hold, $10.40 then $10. The delta on those puts results in high percentage gains on small drops. Very appealing.

So, there you have it, from a guy who has no fucking idea what he's talking about, but can talk shit just like everyone else. ;)",ennagizer,wallstreetbets,0.0

1,2019-12-09,"I disagree. It might go mid 140s, but probably more like high 140s. To get MSFT low 140s or lower would just be too good of a deal at tgis point, and the market doesn't give good deals unless something major happens. Tariffs on the 15th isn't something major, only if tariffs are raised to like 25% will the market collapse. Tariffs on the 15th are kind of expected. I think there are better plays on a market dip than MSFT because those stocks that people aren't so sure of are the ones that drop a lot when there's a dip.

Today, we’re up over 20% ytd, there will be loss selling but not as much. FAANG beat more or less across the board- MSFT and AAPL (the two heavy weights) are killing it. The Fed is expected to ease another 25 bps. China is more or less baked-in, given we’ve been trained not to expect a deal. Will the news hurt? Yeah, but not 900 point crash hurt. Finally economic data is killing it, especially employment claims which is a critical leading indicator.

So it all started in December of 2018. My mom (really) had been researching Marijuana treatments for MS and she decided to buy into a bunch of pot stocks. By the end of January she had gained nearly 50% (GWPH was a big influence on that). ACB was also skyrocketing, so I took $2000 and blasted it between ACB and a few others company’s I hardly even researched. Well, that $2000 is now worth $790... and I wish I had just spent the whole effing thing on MSFT stocks.

He is the comander in chief of the US military and this is a huge national defense contract, so he kinda does have a say in the matter, weather you or I agree with it or not.

I do think this is the case and it is not at all silly. It will be more difficult for them to access classified data from MSFT employees than AMZN employees.  Of course nothing is impossible and they, or others, may one day access such data.
