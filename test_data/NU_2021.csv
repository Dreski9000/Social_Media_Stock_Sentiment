As a grown young college kid now I thought Sbarro pizza was theeee NYC authentic pizza. It was the thing to do getting a giant slice from Times Square mind you. So my guppy now Texan ass stood in line waiting with my boys to get a big slice of pie. The guy in front of me left and I was politely waiting for this Puerto Rican chic to say “Next Please”. She dead stared at me in my eyes silent. I was silent. It got awkward. I was waiting for her to call me up because that’s what nice Texas customer service does. She kept staring. I kept staring. Felt like an eternity. Then she said. “ What do you want!?” I choked. My boys were crying. I had a heavy gulp in my throat. I squeaked out. “Um  ☝️pizza”. She looked at me like she was about to drop kick me. “Which one!?” I said. Cheese softly.  She screamed back “ 3 cheese pies!”  I paid what it felt like $42 and walked my ass out. My boy was like. Dog. What the fuck was that? I was like man! That was Nu Yoak fast life! They don’t know service here! Ain’t no body got time for that. Take it and leave it!

0,2021-06-09,"Can confirm.  I work at a large-scale machine shop as a cost estimator, we buy direct from mills like Nucor and Eaton Steel.   Our raw material prices have tripled, and we still can't keep up with demand.  **We are the largest North American buyer of bar stock**, and we are on allocation through at least October right now (meaning we cannot increase our orders more, we can only take what is allocated to us).   Our customers(think global hydraulic component mfrs) are continually increasing their orders and we cannot keep up.  Our lead times are months, not weeks.  I have learned that raw material prices (not just steel) are heavily dependent on gasoline demand.  The refining process for gasoline yields the byproducts used to make steel, plastic, batteries, polys, etc etc etc.   As well as transport (diesel is a byproduct of refining gasoline) When overall demand for gasoline is down (like it is now) the price of refinery byproduct goes up.  So the cost to make steel is rising. Transport costs go up because the less gas they refine, the less diesel is produced. Add that price increase to the global labor shortage and the fact that global production capacity is topped out, and steel prices are going nowhere but up for at least the next year.   Steel mills and ancillary businesses should be posting record profits these next few quarters in spite of these cost increases because they can basically name their price right now, and they are.  Our steel costs have tripled this year, and that is highly unusual. Normally steel prices are negotiated once a year. But prices are going up and our business is INCREASING.

“The pronunciations have come to English via other languages (French/Latin), which have exerted their own influence.”

Aka unlearned retards

“The pronunciations received from them went through the Great Vowel Shift, which probably explains the ""pee""-versus-""pie"" for ""pi"" aspect.”

Or, nu and ni 

“Also note that the pronunciation in English is not itself consistent: in my experience most UK speakers say ""beet-a"" for beta, whereas many US speakers pronounce the same letter as ""bate-a"".“

1,2021-12-02,"English is not trying to copy Ancient Greek. These alpha delta translations are approximations of foreigners trying to pronounce Greek, which can be traced back to Ancient Greek.

Some euro dudes a few hundred years ago tried to pronounce the Greek alphabet and the best they could do was alpha, delta, etc etc. Nu is not how the ancients pronounced it.

I'm not going back to catch up on the whole argument, as I recall it started with the fact that the main reason the English pronunciation of ""nu"" differs from the modern Greek name of the same letter is that English is trying to copy the Ancient Greek pronunciation (albeit imperfectly), while Greek has had gradual pronunciation shifts over the centuries like literally every language has since the paleolithic at least, which is almost entirely ignored by the English language.

2,2021-12-02,"But I wasn't asserting that. All I'm saying about νῦ is that when English pronounces it ""nu"", it doesn't derive from an attempt at pronouncing [ni], it derives from an attempt at pronouncing [nyː], which is the ancient pronunciation. English doesn't have the [y] sound, so it got approximated in English as [njuː] or [nu:]. Even that's probably an oversimplification. The point is simply that there's no need for modern Greek pronunciation to even be relevant when discussing ancient Greek terms in English. An equivalent scenario in reverse might be Greeks discussing Beowulf, and me, knowing very little about Old English, correcting everyone and calling myself an expert just because I'm English.

It's **okay** that the names of the Greek letters are pronounced differently by Greeks living in different millenia. It's okay not to be an expert on ancient Greek. You're allowed. It doesn't make you less Greek.",Unlearned_One,wallstreetbets,2.0

1,2021-12-09,"Had to go 5 posts down to find this one reasonable post. 

The greater powers of the world had 2 very simple choices at the onset of the pandemic:

1. Print like crazy and rack up debt spend to save the economy and lives. Then keep spending big with big inflation hoping that it would rev your economy coming out of the recession &amp; pandemic. (example: USA)

2. Don't do 1 or don't do it enough. See your people die, the people's discontent rise, lockdowns come and go, reopenings fails, economy staggers, and inflation hikes anyways because every other country is printing but your own fiat doesn't appreciate against them because fiat valuation is based on belief in power/economy/stability of the underlying issuer. (example: Brazil)

Inflation will impact you no matter which you chose. Might as well choose the one that pumps the economy and saves lives/businesses. There were 0 countries that chose NOT to spend during the pandemic, let their people die, and and came out stronger for it.

But now every country (that chose option 1 and didn't get BTFO) is saddled with a ton of debt from the spending and are left with simple choices:

1. Hike taxes and/or decrease spending during a period of global reopening hampering your own growth while pissing off your citizens.

2. Decrease the debt by letting inflation run hotter but not run away. That same inflation which would force higher taxes even if you don't rise rates, decrease the huge debt burden racked up before, AND keep interest on that debt low.

No matter which you chose, you're either paying that debt or getting fucked. Might as well lighten that load with higher inflation because it will boost growth and lighten the load.
