17,2021-01-01,So let’s say volatility is super low and QQQ goes up 30% this year and TQQQ goes up 100%. You could have just bought the 380/400 call spread I outlined in my other comment and made a 500% gain.,ImLennyBruce,wallstreetbets,17.0
18,2021-01-01,"If you are bullish on QQQ this year you and you are looking for 100% profit then you could simply open a bull call spread on QQQ. For example, at close yesterday a jan 2022 315/335c was selling for 9.63. Your breakeven would be 324. So as long as QQQ ends the year up about 3.5% you don’t lose money. If QQQ ends the year up just 7% you hit max profit of $1,037. You risk $963 (+ fees) to make $1,037.

If you think 7% is pussy shit you can go further OTM. For example, 380/400 would cost $332 with max profit $1,668 for a potential 500% gain. Betting on another 30% year for QQQ is a much riskier strategy. BUT compare that to TQQQ where QQQ would probably have to move 40% for you to get a 100% gain and it starts to look pretty good.

I would buy mostly close to the money with the idea that I could buy back the short leg if/when we get a market correction. That way I can take profit on the pullback and uncap my upside. This completely changes the risk profile so run the numbers for yourself before doing this.",ImLennyBruce,wallstreetbets,18.0

If that’s the case I suggest you simply by the QQQ which is a mire direct bet (bullish on the Nasdaq).  Plus it has cheaper internal expenses and more liquid.  But hey you do you.  

If playing with options and totally being honest and tying to help

1.  I wound’t play the meme stocks or at least not as often 

2. Try to avoid buying options which expire the same week (I know they are cheaper but thats for a reason harder to make money and easy to lose it all) 

3. Also try to buy as deep in the money as possible.  Again I know there are cheap contracts and again they are cheap for a reason. 

4 IV - Implied Volatility - that is literally the most important pice of data you need to know and understand if you trade options.  Tbt lover the IV the better.  If it’s over 100 I don’t touch it.  Making money w options is not really based on the price movement of the stock but depends a lot more on the volatility level.  If you buy a lower IV volatility contract which then spikes due to some news on the company that’s when you make money.  However if you buy a contract with a high IV which later on goes down you will bleed out even if the stock is moving in the direction of your bet.

Don't look at all of the people making huge gains, and turning $5k into a million. It is extraodinarily unlikely to happen to you. In fact, you will only lose money chasing that dream. Live as simple as possible, earn as much income as possible, save as much as possible, max your roth, dump everything into vtsax. If you must trade options, do so in a roth for tax free gains, and no worries of wash sales. Retire in under 10 to 15 years.  That's my advice. Also, don't quit your job to be a full time day trader, those people are dumb.  Today I made 2 months worth of salary. I made 30% gains in 2020. Guess what, I'm not quitting my job to day trade.

21,2021-01-08,"My daily PSA for QQQJ

If you're bullish on tech and you're also confident on 2021 being a recovery year for beaten-down stocks, then there is no easier and safer play than  QQQJ.

It is attractive because:

1.	⁠Unlike QQQ which is overweight in the big tech giants, QQQJ has tech but also has significant holdings in healthcare, consumer discretion and industrials.
2.	⁠If 2021 is indeed a recovery year, then there is more upside to QQQJ since it contains more beaten down stocks than QQQ.
3.	⁠For options, IV is still relatively low. Show me another ETF stock that has gone up 26% since November 1 with IV as low as 25-30%. Premiums on QQQJ are ridiculously cheap. ARKK, ICLN etc have all gone up higher since November but check their IV and option premiums.
4.	⁠It is fairly consistent. On deep red days, it doesn't tank too severely and on hulk-dick green days it doesn't rocket like ARKG or ICLN. It just reliably goes up calmly and gradually.

I predicted in December that QQQJ will hit $35 by end of February once its constituent companies reported blowout Q4 earnings and give super optimistic guidance for 2021. At this rate, it may even hit $35 by end of January!

Just something to consider as you chase meme stocks and ETFs with ludicrous IV and premiums.

46,2021-01-07,QQQ puts probably will work. Market never lets tech boom two days in a row,victorha1027,wallstreetbets,46.0
47,2021-01-07,"If you're bullish on tech and you're also bullish on a 2021 recovery for stocks still beaten down, then let me introduce you to **QQQJ**. It is attractive because:
1) Unlike QQQ which is overweight in the big tech giants, QQQJ has tech but also has significant holdings in healthcare, consumer discretion and industrials.
2) If 2021 is indeed a recovery year, then there is more upside to QQQJ since it contains more beaten down stocks than QQQ.
3) For options, IV is still relatively low. Show me another ETF stock that has gone up 26% since November 1 with IV as low as 25-30%. Premiums on QQQJ are ridiculously cheap. 
ARKK, ICLN etc have all gone up higher since November but check their IV and option premiums.
4) It is fairly consistent. On red days, it doesn't tank too severely and on green days it doesn't rocket like ARKG. It just goes up calmly and gradually. 

I predicted in December that QQQJ will hit $35 by end of February, once its constituent companies report blow out Q4 earnings and give super positive guidance for 2021. At this rate, it may even hit $35 by end of January! 

Just something to consider as you chase meme stocks and ETFs with ludicrous IV and premiums. Have a nice rest of the day and happy New Year!",LaPulgaAtomica87,wallstreetbets,47.0

---------------------------------------------------------

If you're bullish on tech and you're also confident on 2021 being a recovery year for beaten-down stocks, then there is no easier and safer play than  **QQQJ**. 

It is attractive because:
1) Unlike QQQ which is overweight in the big tech giants, QQQJ has tech but also has significant holdings in healthcare, consumer discretion and industrials.
2) If 2021 is indeed a recovery year, then there is more upside to QQQJ since it contains more beaten down stocks than QQQ.
3) For options, IV is still relatively low. Show me another ETF stock that has gone up 26% since November 1 with IV as low as 25-30%. Premiums on QQQJ are ridiculously cheap. 
ARKK, ICLN etc have all gone up higher since November but check their IV and option premiums.
4) It is fairly consistent. On deep red days, it doesn't tank too severely and on hulk-dick green days it doesn't rocket like ARKG or ICLN. It just reliably goes upl gradually. 

I predicted in December that QQQJ will hit $35 by end of February once its constituent companies report blowout Q4 earnings and give super optimistic guidance for 2021. However, at this rate, it may even hit $35 by end of January! 

Just something to consider as you chase meme stocks and ETFs with ludicrous IV and premiums.

I used to just buy QQQ, AAPL, MSFT calls a month or two out and they worked during the rally. Except when I got too close to expiration and didn't cash out and we had one of those nice ol' volatility dips that crushed my gains. Now, I have a strategy.

77,2021-02-01,"•             Amid the heavy de-grossing activity occurring street-wide, funds reduced short exposure significantly on single stocks with a focus on highly volatile equities and equities with high levels of short interest. However, short exposure on equity Index ETF’s was relatively flat to slightly higher as funds stayed in broader hedges (SPY and QQQ rose while IWM was net covered). Calls for shorting being “dead” may be overstated as many funds are actively watching the highly speculative names for signs of exhaustion and opportunities to put short positions back on.

•             Other ETF’s: We saw short interest increase on high yield and govt. debt ETF’s: HYG, IEF, AGG, and LQD. Metals - SLV (also heavily mentioned on retail blogs), GDX and GLD, are all being covered. ARKK SI has been rising as Cathie Woods ETF’s continue to see inflows. XRT borrow is in high demand as GME’s weighting ballooned recently. However, large redemptions has caused borrow liquidity to completely dry up.

•             Reddit names: GME short Interest declined by \~40% -60% on a share basis and remains in the range of 65% - 85% of the float. We are beginning to see an uptick in demand and intraday shorting activity. Borrow is available and rates are currently easing. AMC and BBBY are seeing a similar approach while shorts positions were added to BB and NOK. Any near term weakness on these high flyers may result in further buying pressure from remaining shorts.

•             Not everything was covered: DUK, WISH, TFC, APD, FIS, CCL, VIR, NOC, STZ, PLAN, DG and INTC all saw moderate shorting activity.

•             REIT’s – SI rising in this space – SUI, EXR, EQIX all saw material shorting.",SneakyQuant,wallstreetbets,77.0

We had the first two, but suddenly the DD and knowledge don't matter anymore when they don't align with the narrative being pushed here. DFV and others were on the money with GME being undervalued, the added value of Ryan Cohen, and short squeeze but when you claim the very people who you trusted for data when they said SI was high are now liars when they say its low, you're not a good trader. The #1 rule of trading is to not get blinded by emotions. Yes, what RH did on Thursday was fucked up, yes it's unfair, yes the game is rigged. But do you want to be morally right and stand your ground or do you want to make money? 

I really miss this sub 4-5 million subscribers ago. People knew when to get out, diamond hands was a joke/meme, and there wasn't so much cope when a play wasn't working out -- we just moved on to the next one. There are so many good fucking plays right now (CCIV, VXRT, the fucking QQQ/SPY rebound from all this GME stuff) that you're doing yourself a disservice if you keep your tunnel vision and keep throwing money away on GME. You're giving it to the hedgies at this point. I made money on the way up with shares and calls and on the way down with puts.  WSB style trading has never been about getting stuck on one ticker going in one direction, but about finding the next play. Before you downvote me to shit, think about it critically. This story is all over the mainstream media right now. If this had even the remote possibility of still being insanely profitable, why would the MSM be reporting on it? Why would Robinhood, who we know to be evil, increase the limit on buying shares? You can call me stupid, an idiot, a traitor, a paper hands-er, whatever, but all I know is I kept most of my gains and am making more gains using the profit from my GME gains.",redditforaction,wallstreetbets,46.0

Exchange Circuit Breakers
Stock exchanges can also take measures to ease panic selling by invoking Rule 48 and halting trading when markets have severe downside movements. Under 2012 rules, market-wide circuit breakers (or 'curbs') kick in when the S&amp;P 500 index drops 7% for Level 1; 13% for Level 2; and 20% for Level 3 from the prior day’s close. A market decline that triggers a Level 1 or 2 circuit breaker before 3:25 p.m. Eastern Time will halt trading for 15 minutes, but will not halt trading at or after 3:25 p.m.3﻿

Circuit breakers can also be imposed on single stocks as opposed to the whole market. Under current rules, a trading halt on an individual security is placed into effect if there is a 10% change in value of a security that is a member of the S&amp;P 500 Index, Russell 1000 Index or QQQ ETF within a 5-minute time frame, 30% change in value of a security whose price is equal or greater than $1 per share, and 50% change in value of a security whose price is less than $1 per share.4

I know people are upset about the current situation, and unhappy with the SEC, but lets try to think realistically here - hedge funds go through market makers who are directly tied into the NYSE. There hundreds of digital controls along the way. It's like saying a felon can walk into a grocery store and purchase a gun. Yeah, it's easy to get a gun the US, and yeah felons get guns sometimes, but I think you'll be disappointed to find out that rampant market fraud like this is actually much more tempered. I mean hell, almost every hedge fund lags the broader market. Yeah that's right, most would be better off if they literally just bought SPY and QQQ shares.

As for Citadel - you'll have to be more specific. We talking about *Citidel Securities* (a market maker) or *Citidel the hedge fund*? Market makers make money on the spread. It doesn't matter what direction the stock is going, they make money by providing liquidity and giving **you** the ability to buy and sell. More volume = more tendies for them.

If you're all in on GME shares then I'd say that makes you an investor, and if you're gonna invest then you might as well take the time to understand how some of these market mechanics work or else you will get burned 10/10 times regardless of any squeeze, squoze, or squizzle.

---------------------------------------------------------

If you're bullish on tech and you're also confident on 2021 being a recovery year for beaten-down stocks, then there is no easier and safer play than  **QQQJ**. 

It is attractive because:
1) Unlike QQQ which is overweight in the big tech giants, QQQJ has tech but also has significant holdings in healthcare, consumer discretion and industrials.
2) If 2021 is indeed a recovery year, then there is more upside to QQQJ since it contains more beaten down stocks than QQQ.
3) For options, IV is still relatively low. Show me another ETF stock that has gone up 26% since November 1 with IV as low as 25-30%. Premiums on QQQJ are ridiculously cheap. 
ARKK, ICLN etc have all gone up higher since November but check their IV and option premiums.
4) It is fairly consistent. On deep red days, it doesn't tank too severely and on hulk-dick green days it doesn't rocket like ARKG or ICLN. It just reliably goes up gradually. 

I predicted in December that QQQJ will hit $35 by end of March once its constituent companies reported blowout Q4 earnings and give optimistic guidance for 2021 (due to a vaccine being available and an actual competent administration). However, at this rate, it may even hit $35 before end of February! 

Just something to consider as you chase meme stocks and ETFs with ludicrous IV and premiums.

---------------------------------------------------------

If you're bullish on tech and you're also confident on 2021 being a recovery year for beaten-down stocks, then there is no easier and safer play than  **QQQJ**. 

It is attractive because:
1) Unlike QQQ which is overweight in the big tech giants, QQQJ has tech but also has significant holdings in healthcare, consumer discretion and industrials.
2) If 2021 is indeed a recovery year, then there is more upside to QQQJ since it contains more beaten down stocks than QQQ.
3) For options, IV is still relatively low. Show me another ETF stock that has gone up 26% since November 1 with IV as low as 25-30%. Premiums on QQQJ are ridiculously cheap. 
ARKK, ICLN etc have all gone up higher since November but check their IV and option premiums.
4) It is fairly consistent. On deep red days, it doesn't tank too severely and on hulk-dick green days it doesn't rocket like ARKG or ICLN. It just reliably goes up gradually. 

I predicted in December that QQQJ will hit $35 by end of March once its constituent companies reported blowout Q4 earnings and give optimistic guidance for 2021 (due to a vaccine being available and an actual competent administration). However, at this rate, it may even hit $35 before end of February! 

I'm unashamedly the biggest shill for QQQJ on wsb (check my post history) but for good reason because it hasn't let me down yet. If you want steady and consistent gains, you really can't go wrong with this one. Again, this isn't $100 to $1 million in a month play. It's more like $10,000 to $50-70k in 3 months play: slow and steady. Just something to consider as you chase meme stocks and ETFs with ludicrous IV and premiums.

I’d expect we start with what looks like a normal correction that continues down and ends with a crash which is sort of the pattern of previous crashes. So without first seeing a decent correction happening I don’t see a reason to position for a crash. I think most bears are correct in their outlook but get chewed up trying to time the exact top not realizing that the market has tons of fake drops before the final correction happens.

15,2021-02-11,Well I’m not selling gme till it’s 1k. It might take 100years. Prolly sell some sndl calls I have and start investing heavy in Tesla and qqq,CattleNaive6610,wallstreetbets,15.0
16,2021-02-11,"I'm actually thinking of getting puts on Nasdaq (QQQ) instead of SPY. This coming crash should hit tech/high-valuation companies the hardest. That said, SPY might not be a bad choice now given that Tesla's there now. The 50-day MA is sitting at 10.7k versus the current price which is 13.9k for nasdaq. Something I rarely see anyone talking about either is how the nasdaq nearly doubled in value in less than a year from the covid crash - that's truly retarded.

I've been putting together a few ranges that I think we might see it happen in:

* May-July 2021 if we keep going up and there is no sideways motion - note also that this is a period where people might start being able to go outside more and pandemic restrictions may start lifting (less money flowing into the markets to keep prices high). I think this is something that most people looking into how the pandemic is exacerbating the bubble forget about when they are trying to determine when the bubble might burst.
* Once the average valuation hits dotcom levels and I can't put a range on this yet. Best guess is around 1-2 years away. But that's basing on the rate of change of the dotcom bubble. It might be faster this time around because of how easy it is for anyone to trade.
* The third catalyst that I think would make this tumble is covid restrictions being completely lifted, QE ends, money printers stop, and people stop pouring money into the market. This is assuming it doesn't happen by this summer, so it would be about 1 year out IMO.",OkDog99,wallstreetbets,16.0

26,2021-02-12,"\*\*PSA for QQQJ\*\*

I know a lot of you have got burned chasing meme stocks (GME, PLTR, AMC and weed) and you're looking for something ""safer"" to play now. Well, look no further than call options on QQQJ. It is attractive because:

1) Unlike QQQ which is overweight in big Tech giants, QQQJ has tech but also has significant holdings in healthcare, consumer discretion and industrials.

2) If 2021 is indeed a recovery year, then there is more upside in QQQJ than QQQ since it contains more beaten down stocks than QQQ.

3) For options (the reason why 99% of you are reading this anyway), IV is still relatively low. Show me another ETF that has gone up 30% since November with IV in the 25-30% region. Premiums on QQQJ are ridiculously cheap. ARKK, ICLN, MJ etc have all gone up higher but check their IV and premiums.

4) My favorite reason for being in QQQJ: it is fairly consistent. On deep red days, it doesn't tank too much and on hulk-dick green days, it doesn't rocket like ARKK. It just reliably goes up gradually.  


I predicted in December than QQQJ will hit $35 by March and bought a lot of June $35c options. My thesis was that once the constituent companies in the ET reported good, in some cases blowout earnings and provide optimistic guidance for the upcoming year (due to the vaccine ramp up and an actual competent administration), it should rocket up. However, looking at its current trajectory, it will hit $35 and surpass it by next week!!

Just something to consider as you chase meme stocks and ETFs with ludicrous IV and premiums. Have a nice day and make lots of tendies, brothers and sisters!  


My recommendation: Get options expiring in June and September with strike price between $35 and $40. Park your money there, delete Robinhood and check back in 3 months.",LaPulgaAtomica87,wallstreetbets,26.0
27,2021-02-12,"Yeah it’s a sound, smart play, I’m just not sure this is the market environment to do so. It would be better to wait for a decent dip on spy instead of jumping in at ATHs. 

Obviously do whatever you think is best. I’m currently riding the more speculative stocks since they have higher growth potential than the indices. Small hedge on QQQ.

Buyers will come in...yields matter, but less for $AAPL and $MSFT than for small cap growth tech. Also, stocks can and will go up in a rising yield environment. Look at the dotcom era to see how crazy those valuations are. $SPY $QQQ
are NOT bubbles. The Fed has changed nothing with their monetary easing. The market just got temporarily spooked. Volatility is your friend here--people have money to spend and invest...they will keep buying. Buy this dip and any others in megacaps. And again, the indexes are FINE.

150,2021-03-09,"LONDON (Reuters) - Investors are estimated to have made billions of dollars from their bearish bets on Tesla and big tech stocks in the recent knee-jerk selloff triggered by a jump in U.S. Treasury yields, data from financial analytics firm Ortex showed on Tuesday.

Tesla was short-sellers' biggest win, giving them estimated profits of $4.2 billion so far in 2021, followed by more than $1 billion gains each on Zoom Video and Apple(AAPL), according to Ortex.

They were however burnt by betting against videogame maker Gamestop(GME). The company, which was at the heart of the so-called ""stonks"" retail trading mania, has jumped another 400% in the past two weeks as amateur investors have jumped back in.

GameStop's (GME) e-commerce strategy plans were seen driving this week's renewed gains in January's ""meme"" stocks, alongside speculation that small investors will use their upcoming stimulus checks to trade.

In other major bets, investors made about $1 billion from shorting QQQ, an ETF that tracks the performance of the Nasdaq 100. The tech-heavy benchmark hit correction territory on Monday, slipping more than 10% from record highs.

If you go back a year, you'll see qqq, spy fd's, and some discussion about futures and commodities contracts. You'll see people who found infinite money glitches on shitty trading apps. You'll occasionally see a comment about how to get into options and the comments are not endearing or handholding.

I feel like half my comments I end up deleting these days because the general populace of this sub is too stupid to understand the point, commentary, or humor in them.     

There was always sort of an unwritten rule on wsb that you knew the basics on puts/calls, and nomenclature of options (like what 03/19 30c means). So when we called each other retards, it was more like 'if my call is 2 weeks after earnings, will it bounce back from IV crush?'

11,2021-03-12,"For anyone wondering... I was laid off at the start of February, and took out almost all of my stocks thinking that would spend everything as a world traveler this year. The only stocks that kept in February/March were Chewy and Disney. I gave up on traveling and got a new remote job end of April, then started reinvesting everything. Went YOLO on Delta Airlines, S&amp;P and DOW. Bought 50 Shares of Boeing at $230/share when people thought it was going to recover, which (with other stocks combined) resulted in me losing $6000 in 1 day. kept buying the falling knife in Boeing for months, now at 100 shares bought ~$200/share avg. .

Disney was a loss for a short while, but now I've doubled on that and I'm selling Monday when it's finally LT. Chewy was a lucky one to keep for sure, I bought 250 shares at $22/share and sold it $109/share 1 month ago when I was finally LT. Now it's down to $80/share, so I had incredible luck quadrupling on Chewy. I used my Chewy earnings, about to use my Disney earnings, and $40K of my personal money, to invest in QQQ over the past few months avg $309/share.

Now my current plan is: hold flight stocks a few more months before they become LT gains, transfer them to S&amp;P, and gradually, conservatively invest S&amp;P &amp; QQQ every paycheck aside from that.",absentbrain,wallstreetbets,11.0

14,2021-04-02,"Not financial advice, I literally poopoo and peepee onto my crayon drawings for the thrill of the sport. 

I will explain to you what I wish someone explained to me when I first started trading stocks. Don't throw your money into the market without going to a brokerage like TD Ameritrade or Fidelity, and download their trading software (Thinkorswim for TD, or Active Trader for Fidelity) and look up tutorials. These softwares usually have ""paper trading"", or the ability to make trades without real money for the sake of practice. The bottom line, is to learn your respective software (which one really doesn't matter), and read as much as you can about the different styles people have for interacting with the market. Using paper money for a few years is the best bet, as you'll get to know your own trading strategy and observe the market's behavior over a long period of time. You'll quickly find that a trading strategy might work in a certain market condition, but will completely fall flat in another condition. This is because no matter what you read on Reddit, or Motley Fool, or Seeking Alpha, or even Finviz, ZERO PEOPLE other than the market makers on Wall Street that have access to the real-time order flows have any idea whether or not a stock will go up or down. This is why it's so important to do what another user said and download a balance sheet for a random company, since these numbers are part of the ""fundamentals"" of a company and are pretty much all you're going to get in determining how well their stock price will do. Even then, it's flirting with divination. 

If you really want to help your family, consider investing in an index fund (look up tickers $VTI, $VOO, $QQQ). Index funds (and ETFs) are baskets of stocks that are bought by an investment bank that track a certain index. They allow you to invest in a highly diversified collection of stocks that track a certain part of the market or even a particular industry. $VTI, for example, is an index fund that tracks the total stock market, and moves up or down with the general trends of the market (the general trend historically, of which, is up). It even pays a dividend, which is basically a quarterly/monthly payment YOU receive for holding a stock. Index funds, since they are tracking a large, diversified basket of stocks, allow you to reap the benefits of diversification, without the need to learn how to be a star stock-picker or applied portfolio management. In fact, the returns you will get from investing in an index fund, over long periods of time, will almost always (by a large margin) beat stock-picking. Active managers simply do not make better returns over long periods of time than the overall index. That said, a few grand tossed into just $TSLA a few years ago would've made you a millionaire. It's a crap shoot, so if you don't have the money to lose, focus on saving and investing in safe bets as you build up your war chest. Being fiscally responsible and productive will help those around you more than picking the next $GME.",DoctorWalnut,wallstreetbets,14.0

So what I do is purchase a 100 share lot's worth of LEAPS in SPY, QQQ, IWM, EEM, and XLE. All liquid macro names I want to buy and hold anyways. So instead of 100 shares of SPY, I buy 5 ATM 2023 calls and sell calls at .30, .25, .20, .15, .10 against that on a 7-15 days to exp basis. With the premium I buy the underlying shares. So I use leverage to build up the positions I would buy and hold and do covered calls on anyways, on a long enough timescale to survive a downturn. Then I also wheel some meme stocks like PLTR and WKHS to skim premium that way. Leaps on those aren't as good thanks to higher IV, but you could do the same strategy there.

32,2021-04-07,"&gt;I had 6-10k to begin with. Gave my friends back a total of $2500, even though I lost their money, then proceeded to lose more money. I'd rather them just be happy even if they don't do much for me besides play League of Legends with me here and there.  
&gt;  
&gt;I used to be addicted to drugs(Sober day 93, today!\~) - And the most I ever had on me at once before getting into investing(Nov. 2020) was $3400(Which I used for my streaming computer.) I'm 27 / Male.  
&gt;  
&gt;I basically lost all my money as of today, learning stuff like IV crush, being too optimistic, spreading myself too thin, learning interface / day-trade capabilities, how to share financial opinions, perhaps impatience, and tilt trying to make back all the money I lost on calls.  
&gt;  
&gt;I pray AMC or GME take off soon while I still have some contracts over them, netting me 10K-20k and redeeming myself completely. I'd be the happiest.  
&gt;  
&gt;Life could be worse. I'll save up 2k(minimum needed for margin/advanced options) learn spreads, etc. - strictly day-trade on active, less risky/expensive calls/puts(SPY/QQQ/RIOT), play my red contracts, not buy anymore(except for stocks(not options) and crip-toe), and salvage what I can from foreseen losing calls.  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm getting unemployment $(Never before last year, did I ever expect this) - don't live with my mom anymore(my grandparents instead) - and am not crippled in bed!\~  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm going to go workout, save-up, not tell anyone about my finances(Huge, and a lesson I learned as well.) Be patient, improve, and try my best. I'll make it all back.  
&gt;  
&gt;What's life, anyways? 40k, or $100. Not really enough to change my day-to-day - although, maybe it could have been and I still regret not saving 10-20k.

If 1 million is not enough, and you want to Hwang it, then ask your broker for 5x portfolio margin when you're over 100k.

GME is trading at 2.15 EV/Sales while GPS is trading at .8 EV/Sales.  If it's such a value play why is Gamestop trading at a higher value than the Gap?

They by definition make their money by servicing your order below market price.  Orders filled from NYSE are notoriously shit and I would much rather have several robots compete for my order rather than 3 exchanges.  Payment for order flow has done nothing but help the consumer.  Also if you trade on liquid underlyings like SPY QQQ etc then you can get nothing other than the perfect fill since the spreads on options are only a penny wide.

Wait a year and see what happens.  If you have a long horizon time is on your side.  The key to learning how to invest money is to develop a strategy.  Write the strategy down and invest a small percentage of your portfolio in it.  Wait 6 months and see if the strategy is a winner, if so invest more.  Track your winning strategies on a monthly basis and see they continue to be winners invest more.  If they become out of favor it’s time to sell and take profits.",Mike_Campbell,wallstreetbets,12.0
13,2021-05-06,A lot of it depends upon your horizon.  I would consider a stock like JMIA to be a great risk and would not invest a large percentage of my portfolio in that.  If you really believe in it don’t invest any more than 5% of your portfolio in it.

You get slippage because the good days with gains cannot overcome the bad days with losses when you apply leverage. *(the videos on youtube do a good job breaking it down better than i could in 4 minutes at 3am)

Sell them when GME starts to go back up or buy ITM calls on QQQ SPY and do the reverse. You can follow the charts and look at the times the peaks are in sync.

Take CLOV, for instance.  People in the industry are posting legit info about the CEO being a total bastard and the company having subpar products and unethical business practices (which they're being investigated for).   I absolutly bought in on Friday and cashed out this morning, leaving the  short bus holding the bag - but I never thought it was a good company or long term hold.  Lots of these pumps are being presented as LONG TERM and HODL plays when in fact any dufus with 8 seconds to think about it knows it's all trash.  Reckless spending on equities in hopes of a home run is classic bubble behavior and we're in for a hard crash when the music stops.  

I'm cashing out a huge amount of equities aside from stable holdings (VT, QQQ, SDIV, AMZN, BUD, KR, etc) in mid July and waiting for this entire thing to explode.

15,2021-07-05,"Hearing warren buffett say some shit like ""they aren't encouraging people to buy low cost index funds and hold for 50 years"" is hilarious because that's like the farthest thing from what he did and charlie munger did to accumulate their wealth. they are rich fucking hypocrites, what else is new. 

Buffett essentially picked companies he perceived as undervalued either relative to book value or other metrics, and used other peoples money to do it. When he first started investing he used a lot of friends/family money, essentially allowing him to invest far more money then he could've made himself, which catapulted his initial wealth and put him a leg up. In my opinion it's the reason why most of the main ways to get rich in America or other developed countries is not to work a 9-5 and buy SPY/QQQ, it's to invest with other people's money, whether that's real estate, stocks, options, whatever. Of course there are tremendous risks in doing so, but you don't get rich as fuck by working a 9-5, since 9-5's carry virtually zero risk to employees.",banditcleaner2,wallstreetbets,15.0

Shits also not transitory, wages are sticky, commodities are stickier then normal as everyone’s afraid to overproduce as Commodities are just coming out of worse demand year into best demand year. Housing will be stickier as people are putting more down and if the market drops 30% even people can afford to hang on better then 08. Chicken shortage, gas shortage.

1. Transport relative strength divergence against SPY. Usually indicates problem in the economy, things aren't going as hot as media says.

2. Bonds headed to the fucking moon. Big money is piling out of equities and into bonds. i.e flight to safety.

3. Market breadth dropping rapidly with FAANG leading. i.e flight to safety.

4. Oil hitting the massive 6 year $76 resistance and then instantly selling off. (part of this is OPEC bullshit though so.. grain of salt).

12,2021-07-11,"Here’s my take on this syndrome. 

The bag holding of losses wouldn’t be so real if it didn’t work so well sometimes. I bought AMD at like 93 and had a fat loss on it within days. Ended up just holding it for a few months and recently it made it back up. Never been so happy with a $140 gain in my life. LOL!

On SPY I used to do the same thing. “Take the gain, then miss the train.” 
I’ve started training myself to buy 100 share lots of everything so that when I’m nervous about it reversing my second option (see what I did there?) to selling is to buy a slightly OTM put instead and see how it goes. I’ll lose a little if it goes sideways but if it’s up I’m happy to pay the insurance since I’m gaining on the shares and if it’s down then I feel great and if it crashes I feel like a genius. I’ve been thinking this weekend about doing that for DIA, SPY, and QQQ going into Tuesday’s CPI and bank earnings. I don’t want to sell, but I don’t feel super comfy next week. You’re talking SPY options so holding the shares may or may not be an option. (Hah, that’s twice)

I’d like to add a third dimension to this, the “why am I terrible at buying in March/April 2020 and riding high on v shaped recoveries? Twice now I’ve witnessed a massive drop in the market and stood there terrified with my cash in hand. I’m still working on that one.

0,2021-08-02,"The only real market triggers I can think of right now are fed policy, inflation data, and delta variant.

Feds very recently confirmed their easy monetary policy and most analysts project tapering happening in September so I believe that should mostly be priced in. So for august I don’t think that’ll be a trigger

Inflation numbers (CPI) comes out on 11th and in my very unprofessional opinion I think it will be at or slightly lower than estimates because gdp numbers that just came out were lower than expected and I think the post covid boom inflation correlates to gdp growth. Nonetheless, lower inflation is bullish

Delta variant is obviously bearish. In the next couple weeks we’re going to have a day we’re the top headline will be something like “150k new daily covid cases”. Regardless of anyone’s opinions on the virus, that will obviously be a red day. However while the reopening stocks may lag as this fear is infested, the tech stocks will probably go up soon after as they did during pandemic and I think it means that the feds will continue easy monetary policy for longer which for tech, is definitely net bullish.

In short, go QQQ",steakandp1e,wallstreetbets,0.0
1,2021-08-02,"The only real triggers could be fed policy, inflation data, and delta variant. 

Feds very recently confirmed their easy monetary policy and most analysts project tapering happening in September so I believe that should mostly be priced in. So for august I don’t think that’ll be a trigger

Inflation numbers (CPI) comes out on 11th and in my very unprofessional opinion I think it will be at or slightly lower than estimates because gdp numbers that just came out were lower than expected and I think the post covid boom inflation correlates to gdp growth. Nonetheless, lower inflation is bullish

Delta variant is obviously bearish. In the next couple weeks we’re going to have a day we’re the top headline will be something like “150k new daily covid cases” and that will obviously be a red day. However while the reopening stocks may lag as this fear is infested, the tech stocks will probably go up soon after as they did during pandemic and I think it means that the feds will continue easy monetary policy for longer which for tech, is definitely net bullish.

In short, go QQQ",steakandp1e,wallstreetbets,1.0

When this portion of your portfolio eventually represents 20% of total assets, x2 shares. The rest of your account will be allotted to buying QQQ dips as follows.

	5% buying QQQ dips of 1% &gt;1week ATM debit spreads.

	15% of total portfolio allocated to buying QQQ dips of 2% which you buy 2-month debit spreads at support or ATM. 

	13% of total portfolio to buying QQQ dips of 3% dips which you buy 3 months debits spreads ATM.

	8.33% of total portfolio allocated to buying QQQ dips of 6% which you buy 1 year debit spreads ATM.

for everything else, sell the next time they rally above your cost basis DO NOT SELL NOW.  Then buy then at their next dip.  From now on if you miss a rally, realize you missed it.   Track the stocks that regularly swing bwtween swing highs and lows each quarter and buy them at their lows.   There are easy 20% gains (and I think even 80%) to be had each quarter.

You're where I was a couple quarters ago, I cut losses on 10k$ worth of facebook at 280 and look where it is now.   I did the same with several other stocks, even GME a week before its second pump.

The next quarter I had too high of a cost basis on what I had left and focused on selling everything at break even - turns out I sold a lot of things too early, but I got my money back, and at the end of June I had 80% cash and hadn't lost anything for a couple months (except the failed calls I let ride just in case)

July I bought a tonne of stuff as their swing lows approached..heck today, mvis and sklz both reached the point I've been waiting for for a long time - 12.50 and 13.50.  I'm convinced they will both swing back to 20+.  I have 4200 Palantir at 22.30 and am convinced it'll go back to 27+.   This time ill sell and buy back in at the low.

You want to stop losing money and start making it.  SQQQ goes down when QQQ goes up. QQQ is likely to continue to go up. 

Look at the chart for QQQ or SPY. Count all the times you wish you’d had bought it. Each time you didn’t buy it, you were wrong. Every stock in your portfolio is red.   You’re not making good buys.

Left only 10k in my webull active trade yolo account, down 5k in weeks from ill advised theta trades, finally made the 5k back just this week from AMD rally. I'm glad I only did dumb yolo trades with a small amount of my money.

The rest I put in a new TDA account and decided to invest wisely. Currently have roughly 100 SPY and a leap, still holding alot of cash waiting for a dip in QQQ, and saving some for the tax man next April. Also used a few grand to pay off my tuition",danielXKY,wallstreetbets,20.0

Also traded the VIX and am 4/4 currently

So basically I catch falling knifes. Part of this is trying to replicate what our Lord and Savior DFV preached. I'm not nearly as smart however because I constantly mistime my options buying and screw the trade up when I could of just bought shares. 

So looking for insider buying 
Low EV/EBITDA ratio's 
Healthy low IV options chain with reasonable bid and ask
Technical indicators that might Signal a bottom 
I use 
RSI 
Slow Stochastic
Volume profile 
Actual Fundamentals (I don't touch AMC,BB etc...)  

I started this journey in December (everyone's a genius in a bull market) I also use a basic confirmation bias of macro outlook crap to help guide my process/autism. For this reason I'm bullish Chinese equities and bearish American Equities in the short term. I have a 15k short position on the QQQ. 

I also ""INvEst"" out of a TFSA so a lot of my call options are naked short dated options and hence I get burned. 70 percent of all options expire worthless btw.

30,2021-08-03,"Contrarian investing is out again. We had a good six months lol. Institutional (Fed) money keeps flowing into SPY and QQQ and value is in a holding/declining pattern while we're all waiting endlessly for reopening (whether or not the company is a reopening play, COVID=volatility=value gets rekt).

Not everything is going to squeeze if 'we' push hard enough.

Also there is no 'we'.

And finally, yes, institutions are watching this sub very carefully now. When WSB jumps in on a stock, it attracts shorts like flies to SHLDQ. Whether or not certain players are seeding and promoting pump and dumps schemes here is in the realm of conspiracy. It may be true, it may not. Do your due diligence.

I saw some pushes in February and March that were downright suspicious...SKT for example, people pushed that stock up 20% in the premarket one day. I sold. That same stock squeezed in January, and it didn't hit that high again, so no short squeeze (or news, or improvement in fundamentals). Why did anyone think that was a good idea? Was it speculative market euphoria, or outright illegal manipulation?

Bottom line: yeah, institutions are trying to make money and all the information here is public. It has nothing to do with them losing money in January and everything to do with the fact that making money is their job. WSB is just an integral part of the stock market now, and we don't have any special power to supercharge our returns.",Solar_Nebula,wallstreetbets,30.0

*""While we don’t expect much from markets today, its possible things start to move next week as we highlight ~25% of SPY/QQQ gamma expiring (~13% of SPX).""*

*""We think that tail risk &amp; downside protection remains bid due to Jackson Hole and the Sep FOMC. This may be preventing a real “vol crush” and is part of what is keeping the lower bound of VIX at 17.   Its likely that August implied volatility gets sold hard with each and every volatility spike, but there isn’t much juice left – August ATM IV is a quiet 10.   As a result we can’t get enough of a “vanna lift” from whats left in August IV.""*

*""4450 remains our upside target into August expiration which is 2 weeks out.  We continue to think that the market is hedged to the downside which prevents a slide lower – particularly before Jackson Hole.""*

If you look, there’s been a few “psych outs” on finance breakthroughs and they basically all revolve around periods of inflation scares, because that would force the feds hand. 

There was even talk of deflation a few weeks ago that really sent finance tumbling. 

Not that I’m in to “technical” stuff, but QQQ is making RSI divergences at ATHs in a way that seems to be screaming correction, especially with earnings out of the way and most of the big tech names getting hit (ouch Amazon).

35,2021-08-12,"I was thinking about a possible uber bullish scenario on SPY especially seeing QQQ today and with OPEX tomorrow maybe giving us some volatility and the energy to get us unstuck from our current slow melt up.

I think running a test of the former break out area of 440.86 - 440.68. Also where the 10 MA is near on the daily.

1 it would give the bulls a good dip and maybe get some cash off the sidelines.

2 It would entice some bears just drooling at the chance to maul this down at these high prices and help rally us through a trendline going back months after getting us to 446.20 ish or the measured move. If you did get some contracts at 440.80ish Id take profit but hold a few for a possible blow off top.

With the tight consolidation the market is edging to blow its load IMO but not without a dip and bear trap to get us through. I would actually be shocked if we melt up there without it. Anyway just to keep in mind.

Nothing too fancy just wanted to buy the dip and make a quick fifty bucks or something. Well this morning it opened pretty strong and was up 100% twenty minutes after the bell. I got greedy though and didn't sell. It luckily didn't fall too far but floated around the +75% range til around noon. I decided $150 was pretty fucking good for a day and decided to cut it down. Sold it, took profits, and then was surprised to see it fall about an hour later. By close it was nearly back down to where it had began. Bought the same call for nearly the same price, but since I took the profits I'm playing with mostly house money now.

The S&amp;P 500 doesn't have as much overall growth and even taking the top 100 doesn't give as good returns as the NASDAQ 100. Probably because the QQQ has less stringent criteria for entry than the S&amp;P 500. Remember, if you held SPY for the last decade you missed out on most of TSLA's growth, while QQQ would've made you money on that growth.

Now 3x leverage that. I know there's arguments about decay and stuff, and I wouldn't own a 3x ETF long term unless it were for an index. Individual sectors have enough really bad days to destroy hopes of making profits long term. And people have said that if TQQQ existed in 2000 and you invested in it your original investment would only recently be getting back to break even after losing 99% in the dot com crash. However, the NASDAQ 100 now is a much better group of companies than it was in 2000.

The fact that we had so many jobs added in July with enhanced unemployed benefits still intact like you mentioned is part of the reason I've felt like they might not play much of a role overall, but I'm not an expert. The rent moratorium is one point that makes the bearish case stronger that I forgot to mention also.

5,2021-09-04,"No the premium is identical given the extra cost to cash secure the put. 100 x strike price - put premium = 100 x share price - call premium. 

For the example you gave the 24p is in the money (ITM) but 24 covered call (to give the identical position) is deep out of the money (OTM)

You are right that generally puts give more premium (but not always) but you are thinking a $5 OTM put vs a $5 OTM call. But the $24p you sold are ITM and again the 24c is OTM so the higher premium for puts argument doesn't apply here. You really should take the time to learn this stuff if you want to get serious about selling options. 

Now you may pull up something like SPY or QQQ and test the equation of strike - put premium vs share price - call premium and see the puts still have a slight edge, but that is because the dividend is priced in to the put premium so still, net net, the ITM short put is identical to a covered call at the same strike and same expiration.",bagtf3,wallstreetbets,5.0

You are talking about a bunch of intangibles here and assigning the worst case outcomes of those intangibles to not using SPY/QQQ. You aren't trying to value those into money, and they can be turned into money value, which is the correct measuring stick. Under that stick, this comparison isn't even in the same magnitude.

I've traded these contracts several tens of thousands of times. Their liquidity is acceptable if you are patient with limit orders except perhaps minutes before a close. They are easier to screw up, it's true. But if you know how to trade options, the penalty is small. I know the liquidity penalty is small compared to the tax benefit. And yes, if you lose on these, they are worse than SPY, but people trade to win with instruments they tend to win at.

SPY support at 421 and the next one at 411. QQQ next support is at 341 i guess. Position: I’ll buy some ATM puts with expiring end of the week just before 11am on QQQ and SPY.

This depends on your time horizon. If you dont need to touch this money for two or more years you can go more risky. Such as individual stocks or high vol or all stock ETF's. With individual stocks you can pick a sector you are interested in and look from there. Like tech, healthcare or financials ect.

If you want to limit your risk you can try larger index ETF such as SPY, QQQ or other mutual funds.

If you own 100 shares of a stock you can then sell a covered call on it to generate more income.

If you sell your shares under a year of ownership you will pay short term cap gains taxes.",rogue163,wallstreetbets,54.0

Covid is at the tail end. Shit ton of vaccines out, and the mutations are likely going to become less deadly. 

Draconian lockdowns and mandates? Where? 

Global shortages? It’s temporary because of shit logistics. 

Conflict with China and Taiwan? LMAO. Not going to happen anytime soon. 

Inflation? Temporary. Yield are barely 1.5%

Political tension in the US pales in comparison to what is was in the 1960s. 

Housing bubble? It’s being driven by low mortgage rates, which are FIXED for the majority of homebuyers. And the housing bubble isn’t everywhere, but hot markets will always stay hot. 

And after a “crash” guess which companies recover the fastest? 

High growth tech. 🤣

There is plenty of FUD in the market right now.

50,2021-10-06,"""Volatility decay can be defined as the effect that daily rebalanced leveraged ETFs will underperform the underlying during periods of volatility, even if the underlying rises. As a simplified example, if QQQ rises 10%, then falls 10%, and then rises 2%, QQQ would eek out a 1% overall gain. In contrast TQQQ would rise 30%, fall 30%, and then rise 6% for an overall loss of 3.5%. While this example may be exaggerated for simplicity, with smaller effects over a long period of time, this effect can really compound.

This means that investors who bet long term on TQQQ and correctly predict that QQQ will rise may still find themselves underperforming. It is not sufficient to predict an overall rise for QQQ but a non-volatile rise for QQQ.""

50,2021-10-07,"Lmao.

&gt;Covid is at the tail end. Shit ton of vaccines out, and the mutations are likely going to become less deadly.

Covid was at the tail end before delta showed up too wasn’t it ? Vaccines don’t work as expected, people still catching and passing the China flu, agree about mutations but that hasn’t helped make governments more rational in their handling of this. 

&gt;Draconian lockdowns and mandates? Where?

Mostly past tense. Still scattered around the world. Australia good example where they beat you for stepping outside maskless and entire blocks of businesses have permanently closed and businesses and people still not allowed to be open or go to work. Within the US we have places like NYC and LA where almost half the population isn’t allowed to patronize businesses because they’re unvaxxed particularly segments of the population like black people who remain 70% unvaxxed  

&gt;Global shortages? It’s temporary because of shit logistics.

How long can it last before the impacts of it are devastating? Why can’t grocery stores keep me stocked within the USA ? We don’t need shipping containers to get meat to grocery stores. Because trucker shortages ? Where’s the truckers ? Why’s it temporary? How long ?

&gt;Conflict with China and Taiwan? LMAO. Not going to happen anytime soon.

China flying into Taiwan air space regularly. Making threats regularly. Maybe it don’t happen but if it does what is America and the world gonna do to help our allies? Will we let China control the chips?

&gt;Inflation? Temporary. Yield are barely 1.5% 

Why ? Because if yellen and JPOW say the word “transitory” enough if it makes it true? CPI is highest it’s been in a long time, businesses are paying more for shit then they ever have, food and gas not factored in and up way larger percentages.  Wage inflation doesn’t tend to lower, wage inflation goes into permanent goods inflation. Adding money to the supply devalues the currency which causes non transitory inflation. 

&gt;Political tension in the US pales in comparison to what is was in the 1960s.

Bullshit. A year ago was far worse than the 60’s, I’d compare tensions closer to the 1860’s

&gt;Housing bubble? It’s being driven by low mortgage rates, which are FIXED for the majority of homebuyers. And the housing bubble isn’t everywhere, but hot markets will always stay hot.

Everything is being driven by low rates. As rates rise buying cools down, as buying is cooling down people aren’t working and their unemployment money is ending, how many homeowners haven’t got their ok’d job back yet or found an equivalent so they can make their mortgage? some renters haven’t paid rent in over a year have all the landlords been reimbursed? Have the landlords been paying their mortgages? How much Chinese money in US real estate will have to liquidate their properties when their evergrande investments go by by? 

&gt;And after a “crash” guess which companies recover the fastest?

&gt;High growth tech. 🤣

I agree. What happens if they can’t get chips in the near term? I haven’t been able to easily get a PS5 in like a year. How bad do you think Sony’s sales have been hurt?

&gt;There is plenty of FUD in the market right now.

A lot with good reason. 

&gt;The play was to sell end of august when Barron’s put that stupid megatech cover out.

Agree. I went 50% cash. And been buying dips as of this week. 

&gt;Prolly a little more dipping for the next two weeks and then back to ATH in QQQ and SPY.

I have no doubt at least SPY hits ATH’s again before end of year and before the crash but I also have no doubt a crash is coming sooner than later.

Another thing that she talks about it this extremely short article with not much information, is UWT, a crude oil **ETN** which reset its leverage monthly, not daily.  Therefore if crude would drop 33.4% in a single month, the ETN would go tits up.  It is much much much more likely for a month reset leveraged product to go down 33.4% in a month than a daily product to go down that much in a single day, especially with market circuit breakers in place.",Nikolai_Volkoff88,wallstreetbets,10.0
11,2021-10-12,"From the prospectus you so authoritatively linked:

""ProShares UltraPro QQQ® (the “Fund”) seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to **three times (3x) the return of the Nasdaq-100® Index (the “Index”)** for a single day, not for any other period.""

It does not deviate.  You are just unaware that daily returns and cumulative returns are two very different things. The relative price action of TQQQ and the Nasdaq 100  over periods longer than 1 day is irrelevant to what TQQQ is designed to do (amplify the returns of the Nasdaq 100 on a daily basis, every trading day, without fail).

Perhaps you should go read the prospectus?",HWDT66,wallstreetbets,11.0
12,2021-10-12,"They aren't amplifying the returns of an index. They are approximating the returns of 3x QQQ using options, futures, swaps etc. It is significantly different.

Since fund inception it has returned 55% while Nasdaq 100 is at 21.7% so it is about -8.7 off of 3x.

$31K from GME 1/22s, 1/29s, and 2/19s  in January.

28,2021-11-04,I don’t think anyone could actually change your mind but just remember that past success is not always a good argument for future success. GME could see some big gains but there were also a lot of people who bought GME back in January when it was in the 300s and either sold at a loss or are still waiting in hopes that it goes back up higher. Meanwhile if those people would have just thrown many in QQQ or (TQQQ if you’re feeling slightly riskier) they could have actually had gains so far. I think it’s likely GME rises and beats the market but I personally wouldn’t touch the stock right now. It’s so completely detached from actual fundamentals that it’s hard to know how things are going.,socialistrob,wallstreetbets,28.0

1 - First off is fee's, there is daily rebalancing that occurs with these types of funds, and they add up fast. It takes a lot of work to maintain these types of leverage

2 - Next is the leverage itself, movements compared to the benchmark are not one to one. This example is straight off Investopedia, which I would recommend you research into;   
Say the index loses 1% every day for four days in a row and then gains +4.1% on the fifth day, which allows it to recover all of its losses. How would a two-times leveraged ETF based on this index perform during this same period?

&amp;#x200B;

|Day|Index Open|Index Close|Index Return|ETF Open|ETF Close|ETF Return|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Monday|$100.00|$99.00|\-1.00%|$100.00|$98.00|\-2.00%|
|Tuesday|$99.00|$98.01|\-1.00%|$98.00|$96.04|\-2.00%|
|Wednesdy|$98.01|$97.03|\-1.00%|$96.04|$94.12|\-2.00%|
|Thursday|$97.03|$96.06|\-1.00%|$94.12|$92.24|\-2.00%|
|Friday|$96.06|$100.00|4.10%|$92.24|$99.80|8.20%|

By the end of the week, our index had returned to its starting point, but our leveraged ETF was still down slightly (0.2%).

3 - Volatility, and I cannot stress this enough when playing with options on these types of funds. It's called 'volatility decay'. This example is straight off The Street article linked;

Example: Say over the past week measured in trading days and not including today, the SPY fell 2.9%. Three times that number is 8.7%, but you will see the impact the daily resets have on performance as the 3x long (ProSh UltPro S&amp;P 500) will cause it to fall 10.85% while the 3x short (PS UltPro Sh S&amp;P 500) rose only 4.46%.

So why is that? [**Volatility decay.**](https://assets.website-files.com/617960145ff34f911afe7243/617960145ff34f0fcdfe79eb_5ed6befa9e2f6d4f2c1095c7_pic-3.png)

This is because the rate of decay of volatility is TRIPLE. Over time this will devour your options.

Over all, I would recommend reading into leveraged ETFs to day trade, they are valuable tools to use if you are patient and have some risk tolerance.

15,2021-11-05,"Be very careful playing with triple leveraged indexes. Over time, this will result in losses due to how these indexes are funded and calculate negative movement. For example say you put $100 in, QQQ moves up %5 then moves down 5%, because how it's leveraged this is actually 15%. This also compounds the volatility, so compare those movements to the VIX and how volatility is priced in. We know the VIX compared to realized volatility is off on excess of 7% to 11%. This means options prices are inflated, throw in triple leverage into the mix, this could blow up real fast. I personally would not YOLO or trade large sums for long periods of time.

0,2021-11-09,"You dont really ""buy"" or ""sell"" a futures contract, you enter the contract and post margin, what that margin is depends on the time of day, brokerage, and how much money is in your account and how it works with your intraday margin. 

12.5K is the initial margin to hold overnight for spy. (called /ES in future speak).

Intra-day it can be alot less depending on your broker.

My intra-day margin is 6K, 12.5K overnight. if i have over 25K in my account, its 4K intra-day. 

NQ is 16K-&gt;10K-6K. (this is QQQ)

RTY is like 7K-&gt;4K-&gt;800. (this is IWM)

CL (Oil) is 8K-&gt;4K-&gt;800 (there is no stock ticker version of this, this is a commodity directly, if you hold until expiration you are on the hook to take ownership of actual oil.) 

GC (gold) has similar margin to CL/Oil.


Your loss or gain on futures contracts determines how many points/ticks you were in profit for during the time you held it. The tick value changes based off product. 
 The tick value for ES is 12.5, with a total of 4 making 1 point, or 50 dollars. 10 points = 1 dollar of spy. so if you enter /ES at 4700, when Spy is 469 (the futures off-set usually by 1 dollar to their ETF equ.), and hold for 1 dollar spy move up, that will be a 10 point move on /ES. meaning 1 dollar of spy=500 dollars move. Thats with just 1 lot of ES.

Imagine holding 10 lots, with a 40K account using the lowest margin? thats 5K per dollar in spy. 

You guys think your 0dte are degen shit, you dont know degen shit, when .02% move on SPY could BTFO you.

I read an article from someone claiming that the best hedge is to just keep a portion of your position in QQQ. Then when the market turns back around, sell that off (at a loss to double down on TQQQ). Then slowly sell off TQQQ on the way up to restore your QQQ safety net.",SaneLad,wallstreetbets,19.0

The downside is that long term bear markets will hurt a lot and sideways markets will decay. IIRC if the dotcom crash happened while tqqq existed it still would not have broken even til recently.

Now some people are dumb, like in 99 and 08, and won't actually do the research to confirm that I'm literally 100% accurate in saying this is the most rejection at a price level we have seen since the rally started last March.

But everyone who's smart should realize that we are not only NOT going to $500, but we can't even hold above $470. Or in QQQs case $405.

Something will always cause either to drop.

Some examples starting small with recurring investments, I open accounts for my nieces and nephews and put in just $100 each holiday and birthday (inconsistently) and bought TQQQ, QQQ, IYY, SSO, or UPRO for them just whenever the day was, here are the results:

11 years old, $4k invested over 11 years, $10k gains
4 years old, $1k invested over 4 years, $3k gains
2 years old, $1k invested over 2 years, $1k gains

There are arguments against long term investing in leveraged ETFs which I’m obviously disregarding… again do your own due diligence to make your own decision on what’s good for you.

7,2021-12-08,"I should've been a little bit more specific, sorry.

I started out with 40k savings, and bought almost all AAPL/MSFT/QQQ shares in 2016 and held until now. A lot of those stocks have gotten 400%+ gains over the 5 years. Then every paycheck I got throughout the years, I kept putting money into stocks into a mixed ratio of safe stocks vs high-risk stocks. I would always make sure that I was allocating most of my portfolio into safe stocks, and a small portion into riskier option plays. I would never risk more than 5-10% of my portfolio on option plays / earnings plays / meme stocks / what have you. I made some big mistakes on options, and made some gains on options. In the end I think I only profited a little bit, and I still have a ways to go when it comes to learning how to be a better options trader. However, my ""long term"" stocks have mostly always gone up, and by safe I mean I was periodically buying AMD, TSLA, NVDA, HD, FB through the years on top of the FAANG that I already had and \*never\* selling. I misspoke when I said I turned 40K into 400K. It was more like I started with 40K, and kept adding money in (from my paychecks) and buying brand-name stocks until my portfolio rose to 400K. In the end I think out of the 400K total amount, almost 100k of it was my own capital from the money I saved from my paychecks from 2016-now (which includes the 40K I started with). The rest were gains. I know this goes against the entire WSB mantra of YOLO-ing everything but at the end of the day, long term stocks are rewarding with patience. The YOLO part is all fun but \*extremely\* high risk and may not be the best idea if you can't handle big losses. Hope that makes sense",AshamedEstate1974,wallstreetbets,7.0

I don’t play much with options for a few reasons. Mainly that 1 thing I know for sure is the market can stay irrational longer than I can stay viable. The market does what it does and it’s very difficult to predict. I played a few calls on QQQ a while back and it was the most stressful couple weeks of my recent “trading” attempts(for the most part I have held long term positions). I almost lost my whole investment of calls with a strike price in the money. It fought back and I cashed them out flat. My premise was right, however my timing was off a bit and that’s the o my reason I didn’t make money. All the loss and gain porn here is posted by those simply gambling fearlessly as most of which are playing with money they are not afraid to lose. I don’t have that luxury.

To do this, I’m gonna keep my $AAPL shares and either get another 100 shares to hold 300 shares outstanding or stay with 200 shares and one LEAPS. From here, I need to do some research on $INTC since my gut is saying they’ve been beaten down for far too long and start as 2 LEAPS and hope to gather enough premium and contract appreciation and turn them into 200 shares. Same strategy with $JPM, $AMD, $MSFT, and maybe even $COIN to be a bit spicy. $SPY and $QQQ will be going into my retirement accounts as LEAPS then to shares.

44,2021-12-08,"While QQQ ceiling is higher than SPYs, we likely won't even meet the ceiling again let alone past it, the tech consolidation by burned out investors running to ""safe"" stocks, like 5-6 of them, has made those stocks way to important to making QQQ move higher, and with them not really pushing high at all with iffy volume a lot of the time, there's nothing really there to get it to $403-405. Any major bounce would only be temporary and would crash back down quickly (like last time).

TSLA being one of those handful along with FB has done great damage, but even if you were to remove both of them the rest aren't really moving or have too low volume. 

This combined with SPY rejection at $470 pretty much confirms the top of the market. DIA is the only wild card but its heavily inconsistent compared to the other two. DIA also relied on many of the same stocks as the other two.

12,2021-12-10,"With 9 rejections in more than half a year at $470+ hopefully, finally you guys realise it's the ceiling for SPY

Volume is also not well, and 7-8 stocks have been the main driver of SPy and QQQ, the latter stopped leading consistently awhile ago, 4 of these stocks, including Tesla just are NOT getting enough push.

There's money bleeding out of these indexes and there's nothing coming in, not volume, to help push upward. You saw pump and dumps today but you didn't see any breaching of ceilings they just hung around under it the last two days.

Most of the Dow and SPY holdings are under the 50 day moving average for months, QQQ already had that issue early this year, driven by 5 sticks primarily.

Retail is also getting burned out, they aren't rushing in as much, the ones that are will only jump on what some call safe stocks not wanting to lose money on the volatility anymore.

Some just ran to bonds and real estate, or dropped out entirely.

Institutions have been selling more and more and so have company insiders and C suite level.

Rivian was the last major mainstream pump. That brought in a temporary increase in investors including those that were burned out, as did Dwac before it. Those were one and dones not likely to jump on anything else.

With no investors and iffy volume, how do you expect to break and hold above $470?

We have peaked gentlemen.

Of course some of you are stubborn and won't believe it, I guess you guys will need 9 more rejections before it's clear.

And for god sake put some of that into traditional stocks unless you actually want to lose everything.",yellow_gatorade,wallstreetbets,16.0
17,2021-12-11,"Selling puts pay out lower but is safer and more consistent. The biggest risk is if you sell puts at a ridiculous price like during a massive hype pump and on shitty companies that will never reach those levels again.

But selling puts on qqq spy or iwm is pretty safe. If u are using the broad market as a comparison, if they all tank 50%, sure the puts u sold is now tits up but so is everyone else who just buy and hold shares so not a big deal.

Buying puts is riskier because they can expire worthless. But payout can be bigger. Most ppl sell them before expiry to cash in on time and volatility. If you wait till expiry, u give up on them as they inch closer to just the intrinsic value of the stock",hellocopterz,wallstreetbets,17.0
