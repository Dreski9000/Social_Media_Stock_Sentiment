0,2018-05-11,"I've shorted TWTR very heavily in the past, and have both made, as well as lost, a butt ton of money doing so. I agree with your sentiment that it's a terrible social media platform. Cumbersome and unintuitive to use for the typical layman. No engagement factor for most people (how many people do you know who made a twitter account, made a small handful of posts then never return?). Slowing user growth. I think the reasons it's bounced so heavily is:

1. Tech beta as a whole - TWTR got battered down really heavily, and, when the rest of tech rallied super hard, TWTR looked severely undervalued in comparison.

2. TWTR as a news/media outlet - as opposed to being used as a social media platform, it does have very concentrated (but unique distribution) real uses as a breaking news platform or a media distribution platform (i.e. DIS content)

3. Improving financials - TWTR was able to turn a profit for the first quarter ever a few quarters back. The problem with this is that the profit wasn't birthed from growth, rather, from expense scale backs, i.e. layoffs, cost cutting, etc., which aren't sustainable and can actually be detrimental long term.

4. Acquisition potential - Every now and then rumors swirl up that TWTR would make a good acquisition target. A DIS/TWTR merger has been rumored on and off for years now, and, with the DIS video partnership, things like that make the possibility seem more feasible.",wellbespoke,wallstreetbets,0.0

Anyway, I bought some TWTR puts Friday EOD and this article gives me assurance.

Also, TWTR has an RSI of 83, it’s overbought. 

First paragraph of the article for those that don’t click:

“Options traders see shares of Twitter rising by about 14% to roughly $42 by expiration on January 18, 2019. The $37 strike price calls have an open interest that heavily outweighs that of the puts by nearly 15 to 1, with 85,000 open call contracts to roughly 5,700 open puts contracts. With the call options trading at a price of about $4.90, a buyer of the calls would need the price of Twitter's stock to rise to about $42 by expiration just for the options to break even. The dollar value of the open interest for the calls is a massive $41.6 million bet, a considerable sum given the length of time until expiration and the erosion of the options time value.”

They might as well just suspend the rest of twitter because Twitter's user base is literally like 80% bot accounts that people use for self advertisement and/or porn. I never understood why people ""invest"" in Twitter, the entire platform relies on fake accounts to be able to keep up with the constant flow on tweets to keep relevant. There's even apps on the Play Store / Apple Store that literally bot posts for you every hour if you want.

Facebook is the better social media platform, even if someone's mom has like 6 accounts because they forgot their password, there's still high amounts of daily (probably even minutely) use from literally a billion people.

SNAP specs 2 cost nothing to produce, they just recycled the excess supply of cameras from v1 and put them in better looking frames. that said, obviously still a PoS product.

&gt; Ad revenue pull back after Rhianna incident

lol really? you think advertisers give a fuck about that?

&gt; HUGE app redesign drove users away and away from using the right side of the app where all the ad stories are displayed

true. i think. i don't actually use snapchat.

&gt; Kardashian backlash about app redesign

no one cares

&gt; Snap merch store created in Feburary flopped

Snap merch was never supposed to be a major revenue source, it's just about building out the brand and brand recognition. just like the WSB merch store. people were making bootleg snapchat products anyway, SNAP might as well make something official.

&gt; Snap hardware executive Mark Randall left a few days ago

Good. Specs suck and they needed a changing of the guard.

&gt; Snap executive sold more bulk shares a few days ago

literally all executives do this all the time are you dumb?

&gt; Snap cash shutdown

??? so what??

&gt; office relocations = $$$$

pretty sure they cut back staff and moved to a smaller office so idk why you would think that.. plus they have a legit CFO now..

&gt; no one uses this shit anymore

not true, everyone i know under the age of 24 uses the shit daily because muh streaks. one guy I know missed a day on his streak and literally called snapchat with a made up sob story to get them to fix it for him. daily user engagement is not going anywhere but up.


**reasons to be bullish**

snapchat never had a bot problem, so there won't be the ""active"" user-drop FB/IG/TWTR saw

snapchat launched a programmatic ad platform this quarter that should cut their margins down significantly

snapchat launched their development platform so advertisers can easily create custom filters

snapchat is still young people's favorite messaging app and that's not changing..",just_quit__srsly,wallstreetbets,7.0

My question is, how would I short TWTR for such a long amount of time? My understanding is that if I use a regular short, I'll have to pay a lot of interest to my broker (how much, actually? I can't short on my current shitty broker). I could use a put option, but as far as I understand with such long term options - and I don't think I could even buy 5 yr expiry options - I would get cucked by time regardless of whether I'm right or wrong.

9,2018-09-05,"My shitty thinking, please critique:

APPL announcement next week, great time to buy calls for the impending runup. 

V, I think I may wait til EOD to buy calls. Historically it looks like when V drops it's a 2 day event before it rebounds, so may even wait until tomorrow.

SQ, it looks like a good time to buy rn, but I'm also hesitant because the stock has been so hot lately this might actually just be signifying the end of its run for a while.

IQ likes to sit around $28. It's at $27 now. A weekly ATM call could be a quick profit.

FB, Twitter, SNAP I'm staying away from these. SNAP seems like it should be lower than it is, I have trouble predicting TWTR movement, and FB is going to stay where it's at until the next ER, but in my opinion that's going to be a huge risk. All in all, there's too much uncertainty in social media with Russian meddling and an upcoming election for me to feel comfortable with these stocks.

MSFT seems like a good buy right now. But it also is coming off an all time high, so I'll probably wait a few days and then see. 

All in all: this dip seems like a good time to buy, but I'm going to wait a bit longer than normal to jump back in since many stocks are coming off all time highs or huge runups.",Travel_Places_n_Stuf,wallstreetbets,9.0

You know if there’d been $TWTR a hundred years ago Teddy Roosevelt would have totally shit posted memes. Plenty of other important people would have too. We live in the greatest time in the history of mankind and most of y’all behave as if everything is horrible and you’re supremely unhappy to boot. I think it’s a lack of truly understanding what life was like prior to this era. 

Y’all don’t grasp what your lives would have been like if you’d lived even just a hundred years ago. For starters you’d have probably died before the age of five, so there’s that. Women died in childbirth all the damn time and typically had ten to twelve children and were lucky if half of them made it to adulthood. And this in what was considered the “civilized” world. No one would have read what you wrote because you’d more than likely have been functionally illiterate with a third grade education (if that) and only rich people got their words published because paper was very expensive.

Also, I just watched $1.2k in TWTR puts expire worthless even though I had an opportunity to sell for $2k briefly and many other opportunities for close to break even.",muchtouch,wallstreetbets,2.0

0,2018-11-08,"Here's what I'm up to:

1. Positions:
   1. 17 x LUV 12/21 55C. Currently up 45% and plan to hold through November. I see a big pop coming due to cyclicality (Check the LUV chart mid-Nov through mid-January) and lower fuel prices.
   2. 3 x AAPL 12/21 $220C. Bought today and think there's huge upside through the rest of the year.
   3. A few other small positions in MSFT, AAPL and T.
2. Where am I after OCT? Up 20% this week with a $3k account balance that was at $8k the beginning of OCT. My low was about $1k. My breakeven at this point is $7k.
3. Lessons:
   1. HOLD LONG POSITIONS even in times of doubt. Example: I had Nov. calls on SBUX and Puts on GE that would have saved my account balance but I let them go for break even or a little more. My gut was to keep these but weak hands are weak hands.
   2. Don't react to day-to-day movements unless you're skilled, can afford the losses or focused on day trading. Noob emotions will ruin you fast. Your actual job is more important.
   3. Focus only on a small amount of positions/companies that you are confident about. At one point I think I had 30 open positions and most were garbage YOLO's. I fed into the FOMO.
   4. CLOSE SHORT TERM POSITIONS if you're closing in on expiry and losing or only slightly winning (unless you have insider knowledge or solid DD otherwise). Stop being greedy or overly optimistic. The best trades I see on here are big money positions that makes 10-25% quickly. Burn a day trade if you have to. Don't overextend yourself with FD's that trick you into holding. Example: One day a couple weeks ago I was up  80% to $1800 on TWTR calls. I held looking for more loot and they expired worthless.  I had multiple chances to pull the money at break-even or minor losses. I didn't want to be wrong. I was wrong.
   5. Gamble with money you're comfortable losing so that you don't feel suicidal.

Anyways, happy trading y'all! Keep it fun! Take all my advice with a grain of salt. I've only been doing this since August.",muchtouch,wallstreetbets,0.0
