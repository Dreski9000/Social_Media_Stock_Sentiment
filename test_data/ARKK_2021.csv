&gt;We're on the brink of a massive deflationary spiral, NOT inflation.

I never argued we're on the brink of inflation.

We pretty much entered a strongly deflationary period in March, and then the Fed stepped in flushing the market with cash. We are not in a deflationary period today mainly because of the Fed's actions, though sure I'd agree it's possible for deflation to set in again.

As soon as it appears deflation is actually setting in, which we'll all know here via a stock market correction, the Fed will ramp up the printing press again -- and a correction would only come in the event the Fed doesn't ramp it up again proactively and avoids it entirely, which seems plausible to me. And stocks will go up again.

Here are other metrics that support the fact that yield chasers are being incentivized to chase:

- [Falling high yield rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BAMLH0A0HYM2EY)
- [Rising margin at broker dealers](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BOGZ1FL663067003Q)

There's too many combinations to run through.

A few days later, Bloomberg ran an article about a JPM-concocted “structured YOLO” product in those exact funds, probably not a coincidence. The same trader is quoted in the [article.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-14/jpmorgan-offers-you-only-live-once-trade-to-bet-on-ark-etfs)

Because the stocks go up so much confidence is high in her and the wisdom of her investments as well as the fundamentals behind the companies held in the ETF. This causes more inflows which makes people more confident in the fundamentals behind the stocks, very few of which have demonstrated a lot of actual value in their markets. At the core there are companies that make little to no money with funds like ARK raising money to buy more shares which can work for a while but will eventually blow up.

I rode ARKK from $68,000-&gt;$200,000 in the span of 8 months in 2020, with most of those gains being attributed to the 9-10% Tesla exposure that ARKK holds. Had I instead put that into Tesla it would've been $68,000-&gt;$650,000.


Certainly i'm not going to cry myself to sleep, nor should anyone feel bad that I ""only"" made a 194% return. Just pointing out that I don't *personally* think this valuation model that they are trading on is completely correct. But clearly I have no clue... because I missed out on a lot of gains due to my beliefs. At least i'm not dumb enough to short it, I guess.",Messiah1934,wallstreetbets,78.0

28,2021-01-08,"My daily PSA for QQQJ

If you're bullish on tech and you're also confident on 2021 being a recovery year for beaten-down stocks, then there is no easier and safer play than  QQQJ.

It is attractive because:

1.	⁠Unlike QQQ which is overweight in the big tech giants, QQQJ has tech but also has significant holdings in healthcare, consumer discretion and industrials.
2.	⁠If 2021 is indeed a recovery year, then there is more upside to QQQJ since it contains more beaten down stocks than QQQ.
3.	⁠For options, IV is still relatively low. Show me another ETF stock that has gone up 26% since November 1 with IV as low as 25-30%. Premiums on QQQJ are ridiculously cheap. ARKK, ICLN etc have all gone up higher since November but check their IV and option premiums.
4.	⁠It is fairly consistent. On deep red days, it doesn't tank too severely and on hulk-dick green days it doesn't rocket like ARKG or ICLN. It just reliably goes up calmly and gradually.

I predicted in December that QQQJ will hit $35 by end of February once its constituent companies reported blowout Q4 earnings and give super optimistic guidance for 2021. At this rate, it may even hit $35 by end of January!

Just something to consider as you chase meme stocks and ETFs with ludicrous IV and premiums.

1) Unlike QQQ which is overweight in the big tech giants, QQQJ has tech but also has significant holdings in healthcare, consumer discretion and industrials.
2) If 2021 is indeed a recovery year, then there is more upside to QQQJ since it contains more beaten down stocks than QQQ.

With the zillion dollar stim Biden is proposing I'll likely buy up a few contracts again on Monday. With that said I want to buy into some contracts for summer/fall/(maybe?) next January. I won't bet against TSLA because that is just stupid. I also don't want to get my ass eaten. So I'm thinking to stay away from TSLA itself and make a longer play into ARKK some more since I'll still get some exposure with them being ~10 of holdings. Other thought is ARKG calls around the same expiration. I'm not a fan of TDOC too much (although Cathie knows better than I do) but CRSP I'm very much in to. Also ARCT's tank at the end of the year being their 5th largest holding makes it attractive. Long rant but thoughts are appreciated.

Even before when folks were saying this, the company wasn't actually ""overpriced"" - e.g., it was still trading within a reasonable range for a high growth company, and if you re-capitalized R&amp;D, it wasn't *too* insane. I was personally long then.

Now, we're looking at a company that is pricing 10+ years of optimistic growth. Sure it could go up, but if it does it's **entirely** due to multiple expansion (i.e., convincing a greater fool to pay a higher price).

Anybody who honestly believes Tesla should be worth $1tn right now is a bullshitter. Elon doesn't believe it, which is why they've been equity financing for the past year; I don't actually buy that Cathie believes it - she's too smart and has already made her money, but ARKK is locked in.

Seriously appreciate the time put into your response. Hadn't really considered ITM calls. I bought into arkk last year, averaged to $90. That's where this money comes from. Considering selling my arkk to do something like this with the proceeds. My goal for the year is to hit 150k, currently built up to 68k. ARKK and ICLN have been my best friends this past year, but I'm not sure if Keeping 78 shares of ARKK will allow me to reach my goal this year. It feels like the 11k could be utilized better on something else.

At the same time though I'm not sure how necessary it is to take on this risk. 11k loss would be a substantial setback being 20% of my holdings.

---------------------------------------------------------

If you're bullish on tech and you're also confident on 2021 being a recovery year for beaten-down stocks, then there is no easier and safer play than  **QQQJ**. 

It is attractive because:
1) Unlike QQQ which is overweight in the big tech giants, QQQJ has tech but also has significant holdings in healthcare, consumer discretion and industrials.
2) If 2021 is indeed a recovery year, then there is more upside to QQQJ since it contains more beaten down stocks than QQQ.
3) For options, IV is still relatively low. Show me another ETF stock that has gone up 26% since November 1 with IV as low as 25-30%. Premiums on QQQJ are ridiculously cheap. 
ARKK, ICLN etc have all gone up higher since November but check their IV and option premiums.
4) It is fairly consistent. On deep red days, it doesn't tank too severely and on hulk-dick green days it doesn't rocket like ARKG or ICLN. It just reliably goes upl gradually. 

I predicted in December that QQQJ will hit $35 by end of February once its constituent companies report blowout Q4 earnings and give super optimistic guidance for 2021. However, at this rate, it may even hit $35 by end of January! 

Just something to consider as you chase meme stocks and ETFs with ludicrous IV and premiums.

-----------------------------------------

If you're bullish on tech and you're also confident on 2021 being a recovery year for beaten-down stocks, then there is no easier and safer play than  **QQQJ**. 

It is attractive because:
1) Unlike QQQ which is overweight in the big tech giants, QQQJ has tech but also has significant holdings in healthcare, consumer discretion and industrials.
2) If 2021 is indeed a recovery year, then there is more upside to QQQJ since it contains more beaten down stocks than QQQ.
3) For options, IV is still relatively low. Show me another ETF stock that has gone up 26% since November 1 with IV as low as 25-30%. Premiums on QQQJ are ridiculously cheap. 
ARKK, ICLN etc have all gone up higher since November but check their IV and option premiums.
4) It is fairly consistent. On deep red days, it doesn't tank too severely and on hulk-dick green days it doesn't rocket like ARKG or ICLN. It just reliably goes up calmly and gradually. 

I predicted in December that QQQJ will hit $35 by end of February once its constituent companies reported blowout Q4 earnings and give super optimistic guidance for 2021. At this rate, it may even hit $35 by end of January! 

Just something to consider as you chase meme stocks and ETFs with ludicrous IV and premiums.

89,2021-01-12,"Thanks buddy, anyways incase if people are still interested in the TDLR,

The major catalysts in the next 100 days are:

2000 stimulus

Joe biden inauguration

Joe biden Investment into Green energy and sustainability

USA fixing things with China and Paris agreement

Major Oil and Gas firms transition to Clean energy

Traditional energy mutual and index funds transition from Oil and Gas to clean energy (E.G XLE)

If biden's plans rolls out smoothly we can easily see this transition within 100-365 days

Personally, I think ICLN is a better play than TAN, PBW and QCLN because while EV is a good investment, it doesn't reflect Clean energy very well and will not be part of the traditional Energy fund transition.

PBW and TAN are specific clean energy sector ETFS. While they are great, until biden declares an obvious winner, choosing ICLN which contains a basket of good clean energy ETFs are better. Similar to choosing ARKK over ARKG and ARKF.

76,2021-02-01,"•             Amid the heavy de-grossing activity occurring street-wide, funds reduced short exposure significantly on single stocks with a focus on highly volatile equities and equities with high levels of short interest. However, short exposure on equity Index ETF’s was relatively flat to slightly higher as funds stayed in broader hedges (SPY and QQQ rose while IWM was net covered). Calls for shorting being “dead” may be overstated as many funds are actively watching the highly speculative names for signs of exhaustion and opportunities to put short positions back on.

•             Other ETF’s: We saw short interest increase on high yield and govt. debt ETF’s: HYG, IEF, AGG, and LQD. Metals - SLV (also heavily mentioned on retail blogs), GDX and GLD, are all being covered. ARKK SI has been rising as Cathie Woods ETF’s continue to see inflows. XRT borrow is in high demand as GME’s weighting ballooned recently. However, large redemptions has caused borrow liquidity to completely dry up.

•             Reddit names: GME short Interest declined by \~40% -60% on a share basis and remains in the range of 65% - 85% of the float. We are beginning to see an uptick in demand and intraday shorting activity. Borrow is available and rates are currently easing. AMC and BBBY are seeing a similar approach while shorts positions were added to BB and NOK. Any near term weakness on these high flyers may result in further buying pressure from remaining shorts.

•             Not everything was covered: DUK, WISH, TFC, APD, FIS, CCL, VIR, NOC, STZ, PLAN, DG and INTC all saw moderate shorting activity.

•             REIT’s – SI rising in this space – SUI, EXR, EQIX all saw material shorting.",SneakyQuant,wallstreetbets,76.0

They have been gaybears (short SPY long Bonds/GC) for all of 2020 and have made peanuts on their GC/SLV positions last year (compared to SPY/ARKK).

Given this hype around wsb, they want to dump their position on my fellow autists and then get into equities (which as you know, are in a dip rn).

Proof: Here's the gaybear king Raoul Pal (Realvision CEO) shilling SLV on his twitter in wsb's name.

I started investing a couple of months ago, and with a deposit of 3.5k dollars, I was able to rise my portfolio to 6,615, dollars. Something that I was very proud of myself for doing. Investing in ARKK and SPCE paid off.

And then...

I saw this movement, trying to stick it to the man, to the street, to a society run by boomers, when it should be run by us.

So I invested most of my extra cash and sold (at a loss btw) all of my shares in stocks besides the two aforementioned.

And then, on Wednesday last week, I bought into 100 shares AMC, 14 GME, 100 NOK.

I know its not a lot, but its all I had.

Today I saw the meme stocks crash. But... I believe in the movement.

I sold all of my SPCE, ARKK, and any other stock I had (which were all in the green from when I bought in btw).

And I doubled down on GME, AMC, and NOK.

THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. But, lets stick together, it is our only hope.

There WILL, in my opinion, be a second short squeeze, one that is far more lucrative than the one on wednesday.

And it is coming, BUT, only if we hold, that is my opinion. Either way, even if I lose all of the money I personally had in my bank account, it was worth it.

I started investing a couple of months ago, and with a deposit of 3.5k dollars, I was able to rise my portfolio to 6,615, dollars. Something that I was very proud of myself for doing. Investing in ARKK and SPCE paid off.

And then...

I saw this movement, trying to stick it to the man, to the street, to a society run by boomers, when it should be run by us.

So I invested most of my extra cash and sold (at a loss btw) all of my shares in stocks besides the two aforementioned.

And then, on Wednesday last week, I bought into 100 shares AMC, 14 GME, 100 NOK.

Retail can hold all they want, they'll just end up holding bags. Because the institutions aren't apes. In fact, they are NOT allowed to be apes even if they wanted to.

- Risk tolerance restrictions. Same reason why Cathie Woods can't hold 100% Tesla stonks in her ARKK fund.

- If the shares did sky-rocket to $1k a share, SEC would literally force arbitration on these institutional holders to settle at a reasonable price with the shorts. This would cause long side institutions to lose more money than if they just sold it willingly at like $200-400.

---------------------------------------------------------

If you're bullish on tech and you're also confident on 2021 being a recovery year for beaten-down stocks, then there is no easier and safer play than  **QQQJ**. 

It is attractive because:
1) Unlike QQQ which is overweight in the big tech giants, QQQJ has tech but also has significant holdings in healthcare, consumer discretion and industrials.
2) If 2021 is indeed a recovery year, then there is more upside to QQQJ since it contains more beaten down stocks than QQQ.
3) For options, IV is still relatively low. Show me another ETF stock that has gone up 26% since November 1 with IV as low as 25-30%. Premiums on QQQJ are ridiculously cheap. 
ARKK, ICLN etc have all gone up higher since November but check their IV and option premiums.
4) It is fairly consistent. On deep red days, it doesn't tank too severely and on hulk-dick green days it doesn't rocket like ARKG or ICLN. It just reliably goes up gradually. 

I predicted in December that QQQJ will hit $35 by end of March once its constituent companies reported blowout Q4 earnings and give optimistic guidance for 2021 (due to a vaccine being available and an actual competent administration). However, at this rate, it may even hit $35 before end of February! 

Just something to consider as you chase meme stocks and ETFs with ludicrous IV and premiums.

52,2021-02-08,"**PSA for QQQJ**
---------------------------------------------------------

If you're bullish on tech and you're also confident on 2021 being a recovery year for beaten-down stocks, then there is no easier and safer play than  **QQQJ**. 

It is attractive because:
1) Unlike QQQ which is overweight in the big tech giants, QQQJ has tech but also has significant holdings in healthcare, consumer discretion and industrials.
2) If 2021 is indeed a recovery year, then there is more upside to QQQJ since it contains more beaten down stocks than QQQ.
3) For options, IV is still relatively low. Show me another ETF stock that has gone up 26% since November 1 with IV as low as 25-30%. Premiums on QQQJ are ridiculously cheap. 
ARKK, ICLN etc have all gone up higher since November but check their IV and option premiums.
4) It is fairly consistent. On deep red days, it doesn't tank too severely and on hulk-dick green days it doesn't rocket like ARKG or ICLN. It just reliably goes up gradually. 

I predicted in December that QQQJ will hit $35 by end of March once its constituent companies reported blowout Q4 earnings and give optimistic guidance for 2021 (due to a vaccine being available and an actual competent administration). However, at this rate, it may even hit $35 before end of February! 

I'm unashamedly the biggest shill for QQQJ on wsb (check my post history) but for good reason because it hasn't let me down yet. If you want steady and consistent gains, you really can't go wrong with this one. Again, this isn't $100 to $1 million in a month play. It's more like $10,000 to $50-70k in 3 months play: slow and steady. Just something to consider as you chase meme stocks and ETFs with ludicrous IV and premiums.

Look at Baba. Modest gains recently. I predict it will be $300 to $350 by eoy. When does it gain and how fast, no idea. Sometimes you have to get in a position and hold it for a while. Timing a big run that happens in a day or two is almost impossible. Knowing when to buy is half the battle, when to sell is the other half. Most the time I exit positions in stages. I sell 10 to 20% after good gains and then sell another 10 to 20% as it continues to increase. Hold maybe 20% if it is really running and have a mental stoploss of selling where I sold the last batch to fully exit.

37,2021-02-12,"\*\*PSA for QQQJ\*\*

I know a lot of you have got burned chasing meme stocks (GME, PLTR, AMC and weed) and you're looking for something ""safer"" to play now. Well, look no further than call options on QQQJ. It is attractive because:

1) Unlike QQQ which is overweight in big Tech giants, QQQJ has tech but also has significant holdings in healthcare, consumer discretion and industrials.

2) If 2021 is indeed a recovery year, then there is more upside in QQQJ than QQQ since it contains more beaten down stocks than QQQ.

3) For options (the reason why 99% of you are reading this anyway), IV is still relatively low. Show me another ETF that has gone up 30% since November with IV in the 25-30% region. Premiums on QQQJ are ridiculously cheap. ARKK, ICLN, MJ etc have all gone up higher but check their IV and premiums.

4) My favorite reason for being in QQQJ: it is fairly consistent. On deep red days, it doesn't tank too much and on hulk-dick green days, it doesn't rocket like ARKK. It just reliably goes up gradually.  


I predicted in December than QQQJ will hit $35 by March and bought a lot of June $35c options. My thesis was that once the constituent companies in the ET reported good, in some cases blowout earnings and provide optimistic guidance for the upcoming year (due to the vaccine ramp up and an actual competent administration), it should rocket up. However, looking at its current trajectory, it will hit $35 and surpass it by next week!!

Just something to consider as you chase meme stocks and ETFs with ludicrous IV and premiums. Have a nice day and make lots of tendies, brothers and sisters!

Short interest dropped like a rock from 9.5% 2/19 to 2.59% yesterday according to Ortex, and Aunt Cathie just added another 3.3M shares to ARKK. Goldman's strong upgrade and price target increase from $13 to $34 doesn't seem like it's been fully priced in yet (jumped from $25-29 after announcement on 2/17 but came right back down). Seems like everyone expects this to get back on the 🚀

There's been resistance at $28-30 forever but there was brief support at $31-32 when it was going nuts - I think 4/1 27c @ $1.61 could be a reasonable short term bet for some modest gains with the chance for significant upside if the hype train gets rolling again.

They did well in earnings and with $1400 about to hit Joe/Jane Sixpack’s bank account, consumer spending doesn’t seem like it will slow. The economic damage of the COVID pandemic did not really ravage DASH’s primary customer base, middle to upper middle class white collar workers. COVID, and the (overstated or not) panic about it is far from over. The media seems content to wind up the public about it until at least June. 

Then we get into the interest rate risk. Everyone is worried that at some point the Fed is going to have to slow the speed of money through the system by raising rates. This “we are fine with inflation above 2% for some time” is political pandering by JP. They run a couple of consecutive quarters above 2% and they’ll be back at the table. But that’s not necessarily bearish on DASH. You could buy puts on ARKK and better ride out all of tech getting seemingly getting punched in the face with a rate increase. 

Of course, one expects a dip when a lockup expires. I believe that the potential swing for DASH may be a bit overstated.

The move will be fueled by dumb money millennials with free money from the government putting it back into speculations like ARKK and Tesla without real fundementals trading on faith put forth by their idols named Elon, Cathie, and Chewy dude.

09:46 AM EST, 03/10/2021 (MT Newswires) -- GameStop(GME) and AMC Entertainment(AMC) , both higher in Wednesday's early regular session, continue to lead mention counts among the WallStreetBets Reddit crowd, but EV stocks led by Tesla (TSLA) and Nio (NIO) are seeing significant herd momentum on the upside.

Tesla and Nio both popped at the open followed by gains in Li Auto(LI) , Xpeng(XPEV) and Plug Power(PLUG) .

Elsewhere, volume interest has been spiking in the cannabis category, with Aphria(APHA) , Tilray(TLRY) and Aurora Cannabis(ACB) recording a jump in average share volume over the last day.

ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) is up about 1% early Wednesday after soaring more than 10% Tuesday.

Continue watching Palantir(PLTR) as its mention count and share volume interest has been growing.

Lots of halfway decent normal non-space things in it, DE, NFLX, but why not throw money into a boring non-space ETF if you want exposure to large caps in multiple sectors?  But if IV is halfway decent might be an ideal candidate to wheel due to price, write CSPs on it and if you get assigned write ATM CCs on it and hot potato it out.  Trying that on something with high IV and high share price like ARKK at 120-125 turns into a 12500 dollar commitment so ARKX might turn out to be better at a 20-25 share price and 2000-2500 commitment.

7,2021-04-08,"I had basically the same holdings (1800 shares @ $19, x14 32c 2023 leaps) so I'll lay it out for ya.

&amp;#x200B;

I started with 20k deposit into my TFSA in the fall of 2019. Covid hit, was down to like 17k, it recovered completely by june. All this time I was making regular deposits. Any extra cash I could find, the market hadn't completely bounced back yet.

&amp;#x200B;

BOOM the government announces covid support payments. I'm eligible for $8,000 over 4 months, fuck ya. So I got an advance on the government money from my father-in-law. Chucked it in the TFSA all at once. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point it was December, and I was balls deep reading GME DD for literally 12 hours a day, ignoring school, my wife, my kid, everything. It consumed the fuck out of me. I was convicted as ever, this was the play and I wasn't gonna pussy out like I did with TSLA. I had 20k ish left in contribution room, so I used my student loans to max out my TFSA for good right before christmas.

&amp;#x200B;

My TFSA balance had grown from 58kish to 75k. I sold off everything I had except for BB and ARKK. Had 11k USD worth of ARKK, 5k USD BB, and the rest was GME. The best decision I ever made, was to sell off my ARKK and roll the proceeds into GME leaps. The stock took off 2 days later. 

&amp;#x200B;

I sold most between 340-360/share in sell orders of 100-200 shares as it fluctuated. Then I dumped my leaps for like 330. Overall I cashed $1.17m to my bank account, and I'm still holding BB leaps and 200 shares of GME. Paid off all debt, bought an apartment and 21' M3LR for cash. I usually live life with zero regrets.....

&amp;#x200B;

But to be completely honest I wish I never pressed sell. I will never tell my family that as they are so proud of me... but I want my shares back. My glorious stack. Fuck.",chirkee,wallstreetbets,7.0

The fund is down by nearly 12% this week and is also setting the stage for its third straight weekly slump as one of the hottest investments on Wall Street unravels at a spectacular rate ahead of Wood's appearance on CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" on Friday at 3 p.m. Eastern Time.”

8,2021-05-13,"It's stranger than that -- that's how a mutual fund works but not an ETF. When you buy a share of ARKK, a market maker like Susquehanna or Jane Street or Citadel will naked short it to you. When you sell it, the same firm will buy it from you and hold it in their inventory. A lot of the orders cancel out but eventually the market maker builds up a decent-sized position -- let's say there are more sellers than buyers so it's a long position. Meanwhile they're hedging the risk on that position by selling short the securities that make up ARKK. When the position gets big enough, the market maker will *exchange in-kind* their ARKK shares for a basket of the underlying securities, which they use to cover their short position. This is how an outflow works; an inflow works the opposite way. So Cathie never gets cash (except from dividends I guess?); she gets baskets of securities.

Now for the chart. Notice how the chart says ""Average Short Interest""? Yea that's right, the chart takes the **average** of the short interests instead of the **weighted average.** Any time an ETF or Mutual fund is involved you use weighted averages be cause using non-weighted averages makes no sense whatsoever. Taking the real weighted average SI % we get 6.30%, a number which doesn't even appear on the original chart. Whoever made this chart clearly needed it to appear more extreme than it actually was so they cherry picked data.

Also, by using the non-weighted average the article was able to take greater advantage of a massive flaw in Bloomberg's short interest calculation of $SKLZ. The article claims that ""short interest in Skillz has skyrocketed to 60% of its entire float in recent weeks."" The 60% number is a flaw by Bloomberg. Bloomberg mis calculated the float  by subtracting shares that were already subtracted from the float. Both Capital IQ and FactSet show short interest numbers around 26%.

Investment Objectives: [The Short ARKK ETF] (the “Fund”) seeks to provide investment results that are approximately the inverse of, before fees and expenses, to the price and yield performance of the ARK Innovation ETF.

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIES: 

The Fund is an actively managed exchange traded fund that attempts to achieve the inverse (-1x) of the return of the ARK Innovation ETF (the “ETF”) for a single day, not for any other period, by entering into a swap agreement on the ETF. A “single day” is measured from the time the Fund calculates its net asset value (“NAV”) to the time of the Fund’s next NAV calculation.

 

The Fund will enter into one or more swap agreements with major global financial institutions for a specified period ranging from a day to more than one year whereby the Fund and the global financial institution will agree to exchange the return (or differentials in rates of return) earned or realized on the ETF. The gross return to be exchanged or “swapped” between the parties is calculated with respect to a “notional amount,” e.g., the return on or change in value of a particular dollar amount representing the ETF.",larrykeras,wallstreetbets,14.0

Who is really going to short the S&amp;P when it is going exponential and lost all relation to  normal valuations years ago? How far can it go? Burry was sitting on his insane short position for 3 years before the bubble popped, most people are going to keep fuelling the cycle because it is usually better to go with the herd than be contrarian. You could be forced to sell your short at a loss before the pay out anyway. And as with 2008, part of the reason that it didn't pop for a long time was Fed complicity, just like now with the money printers and years of 0% interest. The bond market is also insane for related reasons and any defusing of this situation could result in some violent correction.",Pawntoe,wallstreetbets,1.0

3,2021-09-07,"I think Airlines and O&amp;G are sort of tied hand in hand, and both will do well in 2022, but I can see why you think Airlines are ""priced in"". To be honest with you, Airlines are likely going to be the most volatile, but the bankruptcies or downsizing of numerous regional  airlines means that there is going to be larger revenue and earnings for the bigger airlines that will be able to pounce on that. 

Delta's annual EPS was 7.3 in 2019, and while there's been severe dilution, there is also no longer a quarterly dividend of .403 or 1.72 per year. Currently Delta sits at roughly 40.44, and analyst estimates for 2022 are 4.26 (which I think is a bit low), and 6.84 in 2023. That leaves a forward price to earnings ratio of under 10 (Which you are right in that it is roughly fairly valued, or even a touch over valued), but a forward price to earnings of 5.91 by EOY 2023. Under the efficient market hypothesis, therefore, the price is just right for 2022 earnings right now, but as we head into 2022 they'll become undervalued especially if there's a rotation to value.

As for the predatory lending sector, would you be referring to credit cards? That might be the case, but the big banks have strong tech to make sure write offs are minimized, and we're heading into a strong economy in 2022. Usually the write offs you mention would have happened during the pandemic, but government stimulus actually made it so people were paying off their credit card balances, dinging financial companies (But allowing them to release their reserves in recent quarter for soured loans and writeoffs).  I just looked at CACC, but if I was going to dealer financing, I'd look at Stellantis ([https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/stellantis-will-finally-get-its-own-finance-arm/ar-AAOcroM?ocid=uxbndlbing](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/stellantis-will-finally-get-its-own-finance-arm/ar-AAOcroM?ocid=uxbndlbing)) , Ford, or even GM which is looking to get an industrial bank license (rumored to be at least). 

As for Burry, the man's intelligent, and I do think that stocks like ARKK will underperform in a rising rate environment. When the 10YR treasury goes up, the cost of financing your debt if you have term loans/short term loans, and the cost to issue new debt like bonds goes up. That will mean interest payments will rise, and stunt the earnings growth of companies that are in hyper growth mode, while simultaneously increasing the debt to equity ratio of hyper growth companies if they want to maintain price to earnings growth that investors want. It's a bit of a catch 2022. Rising rates, and when the time comes, lower inflation will also mean that more conservative investors will start to purchase bonds once again for yield or at least high dividend yield stocks like UWMC, LYB/DOW, Citi, and other assorted stocks. After all, the value of a dollar now is higher than that of a dollar tomorrow is the logic. Hyper growth stocks will have to deal with higher bars in the form of needing to produce more expected cash flow/earnings, while simultaneously needing to pay more in interest payments when leveraging themselves in debt.",Hani95,wallstreetbets,3.0
4,2021-09-07,"I’d scratch airlines from that playbook just because “priced in”, and business travel will be limited Now that companys see how low they can get their travel budgets. Also look at the “other side” of the macro picture you paint. Higher rates means the predatory lending sector suffers more defaults. Some good short ops there, CACC for example. Like the emerging market plays. Commodities are a sure thing. I already slipped some solid winners into peoples DMs on this. One last comment…Burrey is short TLT and long puts on ARKK.

People think these guys burn money to get market shares.  But they achieved market leadership in most categories and view profitability as a state to state process rather then overall.

Usually risk management departments at brokerages would liquidate the options shortly before expiration when the account does not have sufficient funds to exercise, but I am not familiar with how vanguard does it. It's weird they didn't, but ultimately it's your fault for not monitoring your option into the close, and for not checking your account for several days afterward where you could have still sold the shares at breakeven or better.

Part of me thinks you were fully aware of what was happening and wanted the huge amount of extra leverage that came with owning these shares after liquidation, figuring you could sell for a big profit, and are only now complaining when it turned against you.

20,2021-12-12,"&gt; Because it's an ETF they have to sell off their winners in order to maintain balancing--but the whole point of investing in winners is to hold on to them.

ARKK had a 10% rule... then they changed that to 30%... and then removed it entirely.

29,2021-12-12,ARKK is unique.  Interesting strategy looking for disruptive technologies.  You have to figure that some of these companies will work and some fail.  The strategy is that if they work the return is going to be immense offsetting the failures.  I looked at what Amazon was trading at in 2000 - $20/share.  A fund with the same philosophy as ARKK has today would have been all over that stock and the massive return would have more than made up for picking some losers.  ARKK is designed to find the next Amazon.,Antique_Procedure387,wallstreetbets,29.0
