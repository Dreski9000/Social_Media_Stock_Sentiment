Whenever I open my Youtube feed, after watching one video of that hot Arkk chick (not the MILF), I get nothing but Mid 20-30's guys, a lot of them with an Australian accent, all making movies from their fing bedrooms, about why Tesla is worth whatever the price is, and that it should keep going up:  


\- ""It's not a car company""  


\- ""They will sell insurance and dominate that market cause Tesla will be 50% of the car market and obviously they will all buy Tesla insurance""  


\- ""Robo taxis""  


\- ""They will sell 8000$ 90% margin software packages to homeless people""  


\- ""Battery tech""  


These guys are just spouting the same crap Elon is saying, with no critical thinking skill and sucking in people so they can buy a share with their ad revenue, not seeing any risk / no challenge, as if it will just all happen:  


  
\- They are a car company. That's the only part of their business that generates income.  


\- Tesla's are too expensive atm for most people, so they won't be able to even buy additional option packs. 

\- They have no insurance business. Sure they can try it, but it's stupid to just price in ideas as if they are already reality. If Elon says they are thinking about using the onboard computer during Idle time to build a cloud computing network, doesn't make them more valuable that Microsoft/Google/Amazon combined.  


\- Yeah robo taxis..., cause that is legally / ethically / technologically easy to achieve, lets price that fully in already

&amp;#x200B;

\- It's just battery's like we have in cell phones. Other car makers have been closing that gap in the last couple years and are nearly there. Yeah, they're behind, but they have been spending the last couple years making billion dollar profits...  


VW alone spends tons more in R&amp;D then Tesla does, so by the time people actually buy these electric vehicles, that gap will be gone.

Yeah, there are only like a couple dozen funds you can choose from but I discovered (my company sure as shit never disclosed) a thing they have called Brokeragelink. I can buy whatever I want even options (though there is some language about ""excessive utilization of those). The annoying part is I have to get my payroll deductions funneled into one of their chosen funds and then transfer out to the self-directed part (I don't know maybe there's a way to do it more directly). So I get 75% in VINIX (Eh, low expense ratio) and the rest in another fund and just transfer some out. I don't go nuts as this is my core retirement (80%) and I use robinhood for the other 20% (options speculative stuff) but I have funds like ICLN and ARKK/ARKG, and stocks like Fedex, Facebook, Microsoft, TSM, Guardant Health - solid companies. And then some grandpa stocks like $UNP, Costco, Walmart. Beats the hell out of VINIX (which I do keep some $$ in) which they categorize as 4 out of 5 on the risk scale lol. Plus I save on my taxes every year until I retire and then take less of a hit when I withdraw as I'll be in a lower tax bracket then (I started too late and a divorce kicked my ass).

3,2020-11-04,"&gt;My thinking was this: if Tesla is currently trading high, then ARKK would be trading high

1) Likely, but not entirely due to Tesla, because Tesla is only a percentage of that portfolio. 

Basically ARKK is letting you (really us retail investors) invest in numerous (33-55) ""innovative"" companies without having to pay 7 figures.  

2) Who knows what ""high"" is for Tesla.  However I learned my lesson years ago when I thought $35 was to high and so I waited.

3) Buy and then keep it and don't panic sell.  If [xxxx] is elected and tech and Tesla go down, then wait (or buy more).

4) If you want to gamble/day trade/etc. set aside 5-10% of an account.  Or ideally put that 5-10% in a separate gambling account.  Don't mix investing and gambling.  Or do, but that's a lesson that hurts really bad to learn the hard way.",mbhudson1,wallstreetbets,3.0

In the future you can minority report illnesses before they happen by finding defective DNA. This company has achieved great things by scaling readings to a point where they are affordable to most consumers. If you can predict illnesses before they happen and your tests are cheap, you have a monster business model.

they stopped scaling down the cost of test and instead went for profits. I think the smart move is make tests even cheaper and unlocked a much larger market. to read a genome your basically run it through a scanner over and over to build a picture of the genome. There is a long version and a short version. to corner the market you want to have the capacity to do both and Illumina is really weak on short reads (or was it long?). they even tried to buy companies that could and got denied.

There are middle people who buy/sells the ETF shares will basically have a ratio (weight) of all the stocks in the ETF.  If the ETF is cheap compared to the sum of the stocks, the middle people will buy the ETF and sell the stocks.  If the ETF is more expensive compared to the sum of the stocks, the middle people will sell the ETF and buy the stocks.  But basically what this does intraday is keep the spread small and relatively equivalent to the underlying.

123,2020-12-08,"So i am planning on adding ark to my portfolio for both a short and longer play. 

The shorter play i hope to make profit and keep the initial investment while adding the profit into the longer ark position. 

I have 2 questions.

1.	which sector? Like arkk, arkw, arkg are of an interest so i can do my own dd to see if it aligns with my thoughts. Additionally if one might be better for the short versus another for the long.
2.	shares vs option ratios people think would be the medium risk play. I have mainly short term plays (anything from weeklies- january calls + 100 or more shares for 10+ positions) but i am looking to move into more medium risk positions so i can know i am not just playing right now but will benefit deep in 2021,22,23, ect.


I hope this isn‚Äôt dumb and i hope someone out there has some ideas for me. If there are other ideas on some longer plays let me know. Please and thank you. As well as i hope everyone has a great end of fucking year trading. It has been a pleasure being here with all of you i have learned a lot made a lot lost a lot over here on

Act of 1940, which means they may invest a high percentage of their assets in a limited number of issuers.

Still, based on Yahoo Finance, TSLA is only 10% of ARKK. So I think I missed something in their prospectus.

As for the TSLA sell off, she was probably acquiring shares. I found [the video](https://youtu.be/AWFjfYa28A0?t=593) where she mentions they buy TSLA on the down days.",pierifle,wallstreetbets,0.0

I lean toward G because I have a bio background and believe the next FAANGs will be genomics companies, but imo it the riskiest of the ARK's because there are a ton of biotech companies (hard to pick winners) and we've been waiting for decades for genomics to actually come through and deliver solutions.... still waiting. The advancements and solutions coming out now though convince me it's for real though in the next 5-15 years so I hold more in that then I do in W.

And, as for no mandate, yes that is interesting that they don't have a max %, that would make MUCH more sense for why they are doing so well.  I def. agree that is odd that its still showing Tesla at 10% of ARKK - maybe she recently sold some off some Tesla shares thinking that the S&amp;P inclusion is now fully priced in? I only started looking at the daily transactions today. Have you been following them for a while? If not, maybe someone who has monitored them the last few weeks can chime in if she sold Tesla shares recently?

Since it's subsidized I only have to pay interest when I graduate and even then loan rates are super low. These are the only few years I'm able to just pack my shit and go. So since I can't take a long vacation very easily once I start working, wouldn't it be a good idea to take a long road trip all the way to the grand canyon relatively soon? My body won't even be able to pretty soon. Money is less valuable when you get older and have a full time job compared to being a college kid.

8,2020-12-12,"There are definitely solid companies in the market that are valued highly but could definitely reach their potential in the future. However, there are also overwhelming numbers of companies that have less potential ipoing and getting insane valuations(doordash for example). The market is not going to crash as long as fed keep injecting cash into the marKet through buying assets, but that‚Äôs beside the point. If fed spending comes down then shit is gonna go down the drain and we should all become perma bears. I think the main thing that people are overlooking is that we are long due from a period of huge technological advancement. This is the primary reason why Cathy Wood and her arkk funds are investing in purely disruptive technology. In the end, this could be a bubble, but if the tech thesis comes true then this crazy valuation can definitely be justified. Just have to find the companies with the most potential and not some that can‚Äôt survive the harsh competition. If the bubble gets popped so what lol everyone is gonna get fucked in the ass and I rather be a hopeful optimist and try to bank of the insane tech advancement that we are gonna get in this lifetime.

SPY hits 450 as your 390Ps you bought at the bottom expire worthless. Student loan options traders pump dow to 40,000 off of loan forgiveness. You could have bought PLTR for $27. ARKK keeps breaking all time highs.

31,2020-12-12,"Cathie Wood, head of Ark Investment Management and manager of the wildly popular Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) -- which almost doubled this year -- is combating a move from Resolute Investment Managers to purchase a controlling stake in her company, according to a regulatory filing. Resolute, which helps distribute mutual funds and ETFs including Ark‚Äôs products, acquired a minority investment in Ark in July 2016 and the option to purchase a controlling voting and equity interest, which is exercisable in early 2021.

Wood is ‚Äúdisappointed‚Äù that Resolute and its private equity owner, Kelso &amp; Company, have issued this ‚Äúunwelcome notice that they intend to seize control of our business,‚Äù she said in a statement. ‚ÄúWe do not believe that equity ownership by a party tangential to our business is in the best interest of ARK‚Äôs stakeholders.‚Äù

However an astute autist may realize there are less expensive ETFs like ARKK which meet an autists' risk tolerance. There's also margin.
