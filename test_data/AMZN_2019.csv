Here are my thoughts. Friday has a catalyst event in JPow speaking. Since I still use RH and cannot open same day options, I’m going to buy 1/11s strangles on AMZN on Friday before he speaks( which I assume is 10:15AM EST).. I’ll close the winning leg by EOD and let the losing leg run till expiry. 

Let’s see how this plays out. Since I have 3 day trades left, I might also do a similar strat for Thursday for 1/4s on AMZN with +-$20 OTM positions at 2:45PM EST.  ",Ashes1984,wallstreetbets,3.0

Last time I set stop loss the stock dipped for 2 min and I was out of good position. It won't happen on widely held stocks like AMZN or MU but when you researched and think you found a gem with low intraday  volume that stop loss kick out is rather upsetting. 

Moreover, 'stop loss' is a terrible misnomer. It doesn't guarantee stop loss. It will only trigger sale at market price and if there was a bad news and price fall through really fast you will incur loss.  ",surrealskiller,wallstreetbets,5.0

1,2019-01-04,"For most part I don’t disagree with you.

I should have specified, for mega cap AMZN liquidity problems are substantially minimized as compared to other small cap stocks (while yes I concur that liquidity is always a problem during selloff).

I would argue that the “Fulfilled by Amazon” service offering is only as consumer dependent as is every business service anywhere. Businesses purchase the service and assume risk that it might benefit their effort to grow their business. If you’re going to step that far back then you could say that *every* economic activity is consumer dependent. Point is, the Amazon sellers assume the initial risk, even if they do not renew the service due to less than expected sales.

WMT is *the* contender, and their e-commerce platform and shipping has grown leaps and bounds, but you’re right *they are no Amazon*. Amazon uses its superior platform to compare similar items and recommend items - this benefits the Amazon shoppers. Contrast vs WMT which ultimately is trying to sell off its inventory and chooses to stock items that will provide them greatest margins while maintaining acceptable levels of product quality to avoid returns or upset customers. This is a tremendous difference. Also, Amazon can slash prices far lower than WMT because of less overhead, while scaling to far greater SKUs due to not being limited by brick-and-mortar store size.

Amazons strongest asset is its unparalleled technology. They *literally own the cloud* and have the most advanced AI and machine learning processes in place for over decade (this is method they use for clustering consumer behavior with respect to purchased items - how they able to recommend products on the fly for all products always - that’s classic example of machine learning and they are THE best at it. Also, they have robots that won’t get into.

My point, which you agree, is that since technology is ubiquitous in *every* industry, and Amazon clearly has superior technology capability, then combined with all other advantages they possess they can dethrone anybody.

It’s only cheap until it suddenly isn’t, and then the tendie ship has sailed and you continue to wait for it to come back down - but never does.

6,2019-01-04,"I agree with all of that. But, that doesn't mean PE is a good indicator of price movement. For example, your hints suggests you're shorting AMZN, others will see a PE of 86 and think, ""wow, what a discount!"" So, what's a reasonable PE for AMZN -- 65, 50, 35? Are your balls big enough to short it to it's historical median PE? How about GOOG, MSFT, TSLA, NVDA, MU, BAC, JPM, V, VZ, T, ...whatever? The variances among them are crazytown -- just as they are for all companies. Further, when you see low PEs is it a value? Literally no one knows. I've seen PEs of 5 go to 2 and sit there for years; I've seen PEs of 65 go to 90 in days; I've seen PEs of 120 go to 170 -- obviously that had to come down right? Wrong, fuck us, it shot up to 180 and sat for weeks...then, fuck us again, 210 for a few months. My point was only that if you look at PE and think ""I'll gamble based on that essentially arbitrary number."" then you probably belong here.",gizamo,wallstreetbets,6.0
7,2019-01-03,"All you have to do is take a look at 1998-2001 with the PE's that companies had, and then take a look after 2002 to understand that yes, while there are some exceptions, in the long run all companies will experience sobering of the prices and fundamentals once growth in a company slows down. AMZN can easily just as tank with 1 anti trust case (ie : see Microsoft). And actually if you look at your example, the PE ratios are rapidly droping for AMZN. During the 5 years prior, Amazon was funnelling all profits back into Capex investments (see better hardware) so the PE was sky high, the fact that their PE is around 90 is testament to my statement that investors are balance sheeting this company on a yearly basis and will continue to do so going forward. Nobody would accept a company PE of 90 (this represents 90 years for ROI) without astounding growth. What do you think happens when AMZN can not meet that growth (hint in a QT environment)? hint : see NVDA. No company will be immune from sky high PEs forever. None. There is no such thing as 90-100% growth forever (as long as we are on planet earth).  Thus you can conclude that no company can have high PE forever either.

I think it is massively positioned to disrupt almost any industry in the world. Best tech, incredible infrastructure, incredible funding, connections, leadership, etc.

I also like that they are so diversified within the single company (cloud, retail, WF, media, subscription/prime, marketing, logistics, robotics, healthcare, etc.).

That combined with their high share price (reducing the option entry price to drive out many retail investors) reduces option speculation and overall volatility (or so it would have seemed 3 months ago), to typically make AMZN a great long hold that will grow, is ‘diversified’, and less volatile than similar tech growth stocks.

* Cost: $555 for the call, $580 for the put, Total: $1135 ""investment""
* Closing Price: $219 for the call,$1048 for the put
* JPow please giveth and giveth both sides???
   * Jpow is hawkish: AMZN tanks to 1450 and that put will print tendies early in the AM, so I can cash out
   * Jpow is dovish:  AMZN skyrockets again to 1550 and hopefully that will print decent tendies on the call.
* If Market stays flat then its a bummer. Given that its Friday, I am planning to close them before 2:00PM.

6,2019-01-05,"To be honest. This is a good time for the dip to happen. Usually Jan-March are times where you get bonus plus RSUs assigned. So in case you are starting a new RSU cycle.. you will get more shares cause of this 20% drop across the board. Correct me if I’m wrong.

I can tell you that I’m actually thinking of long term gains and this year and the next is going to perfect for scooping cheap shares of companies like SQ, AAPL, NVDA, WMT, AMZN, MSFT, GOOG. 

Current entry point is not the bottom for these stocks as we have seen huge swings in both directions. 

Been thinking about this on my way home. Given the current swings, I’m not opening any long term positions except my 45$P Sq March puts.  
Going to do just weekly get in get out calls/puts based on trend and volume. 3 day trade a week on AMZN, QQQ should be fine.

There is nothing ""wrong"" with having more shares outstanding per se. But heavily diluting does a lot of things: reduces shareholder returns*, lowers insider ownership %, make further dilutions and capital raises harder, makes trading the stock worse (bid/ask spread  becomes a larger % of the price), etc.

*Generally when you dilute its to:

A - raise capital. Then the underwriters get warrants and extra benefits, which means shareholders lose out.

B - take over a company, where almost all takeovers involve overpaying for something, which once again makes current shareholders lose out.

ie, ACB has a higher market cap than in late 2017, yet the shareholders have seen a negative return over the same time frame.",seank11,wallstreetbets,2.0

So, AMZN ripping up constantly didn't change your mind? That's a red flag right there. If the market disagrees with you, it's your job to figure out why.

&gt;There is room for them to continue expanding beyond what amounts to mail order retail

So they can potential capture more market share, even though they are one of the biggest companies on the planet? That's actually a good thing. 

&gt;as a prime member I don't even go to the mall anymore

You want to short the company that completely transformed the way you personally shop, and by your own admission, isn't done growing? Okay

&gt;their deals of the day and 'prime day' look more and more like dollar store sales: Dog eye wipes, three packs of scissors, replacement casters for chairs, 500$ security systems.

So high margin items are going on sale more often? That's actually good for the company as well, regardless of your feelings towards them.

&gt;Staff are starting to seriously talk about walkouts and unionizing and I sincerely doubt the efficacy of the automated systems they're talking about implementing.

Systems automated by Amazon are at least x10000 more capable then a bunch of unionized morons skipping out on their paychecks. 

&gt;Prime TV is no where near as good as netflix IMO. 

So they also have potential for growth in the streaming business? Not bad

&gt;Walmart.com is cheaper on just about everything, even including the cost of shipping.

I wonder how that's working out for them. 

&gt;Going beyond that, the short interest is only at 1.5% which means that when it plunges, there's gonna be no short covering to stop the drop.

Maybe the short interest is low because shorting the company is a retarded idea? ",Goodbot9000,wallstreetbets,28.0

If they stay weak and open in a dump, they can pull down the rest of the market down. Of corse, if Citi releases a killer ER before open, we may get the juice needed to break through 260.

9,2019-01-12,"If AMZN goes down even just a small amount, the cost of having bought a put is less than the loss you incur from having sold the same dollar-value of shares.

Example:

AMZN is trading at $1640.56 per share today. You own 100 shares. You want to hedge against the price of AMZN falling. You can either

A) Buy a $1980 put expiring 2020/01/17 for $408.40 * 100 = $40,840.

B) Sell some of your shares.

It's January 17th, 2020 and AMZN is trading at $X. 

In Scenario A, the value of your investment is the value of the put minus its cost when you bought it. 100 * max($1980, $X) - $40,840. **Worst Case**: $157,160. **Best Case**: AMZN is trading above $1,980 and you are only out the $40k it cost to buy the put. [Plot A](https://i.imgur.com/9KT1K2q.png).

In Scenario B, the value of your investment is $X * (100 - C) + $40,840, where C is the number of shares you sold. Let's say you sold $40,840 worth of shares --- about 25 of them --- instead of buying the put. Your investment is worth $X * 75 + $40,840. **Worst Case**: $0. **Best Case**: $40,840 more than Scenario A. [Plot B](https://i.imgur.com/jGD8srY.png).

Looking at the value of your investment in Scenario A minus the value of your investment in Scenario B, you can clearly see that AMZN doesn't have to fall much at all before Scenario A is the winner. [Plot of A minus B](https://i.imgur.com/TqruAXr.png).",confbase,wallstreetbets,9.0

i woke up this morning to see CVX at 200% and amzn at -90%

i sold CVX contracts for $428 and sold amzn for a whopping $77 around 7:50am pst. 

i then instantly bought spy $269 2/6 put. 5 contracts for $475.

i sold 3 of them at 11:43 pst for $1.14 each ($342 total), sold another at 12:18 pst for 121 and held onto my last one

i then bought MU 38.5 2/8 put. 2 contracts at .48 cents ($96 total)

i then bought BP 40.5 put 2/8. 3 contracts at .34 cents (102 total) at 12:38pm pst

i then bought spy 269 call 2/4. 1 contract at $140 at 12:41pm pst.

spy call is currently +7.14%

(my last) spy put is currently +1.05% (one whole dollar! should've just sold earlier today)

my BP put is -2.94%

my MU put is +2.08%

i meant to buy some ON $20 2.15 puts but my limit order was never filled but i dont really care.

long story short, my portfolio took about a 90% loss, but with chevron and the puts i bought and sold later, i ended with only a 40% loss. I'm pretty happy about that

\- They hiked their Prime membership cost. I am sure a lot of people are going to cancel their membership. I have a Prime membership and I can afford it but I am tempted to cancel it because I don't really use it as much. If on an odd occasion I have to use Prime, I can just buy membership for the month and it will be cheaper for me.

MAGAs will soon fight for cloud dominance. So, whichever gets MU first will get DRAM, NAND and XPoint at cost, which would be a huge advantage if/when memory cycles back. For MAG, this would also cut costs for their devices (and mitigate the issue of Samsung messing with inventories and jacking prices around on them).

Another way to ensure cloud dominance is to snatch up big data players and keep or put them on your cloud.

Netflix would have to churn out quality content, daily, for 20 years to reach the income level of the Disney vault + StarWars + ESPN + Hulu.  NFLX would then have to get into the hospitality business.  It's impossible, especially when NFLX's board has pissed off every competitor so badly they're all in the streaming business (NBC, DIS, HBO, AMZN, FOX, FX, AMC, etc).  Now Disney is talking up ""bundles""...so time is a flat circle we're all back to cable prices essentially.

Tesla is even worse.  As are 90% of growth tech companies.  When the market shakes only profit stops the sell off &amp; tech has little to justify market caps outside the big 3.  We're literally in a dot com bubble rebirth except it's repackaged as ""apps"".

[MSFT:](https://i.imgur.com/aFxBOcp.png) This chart's like a TA wet dream. Broke out of the rising wedge and sold off to support, bounced back up to backtest the trend line today and failed. Expecting a move back down to test 101.50 and eventually 97.50 or lower. 

[GOOGL:](https://i.imgur.com/uOU2zNy.png) Pretty close to a bearish engulfing candle and closed below the 200 MA. Support in the 1106 range, look to short if it drops below. 

[AMZN:](https://i.imgur.com/CdiNHae.png) Looks extremely bearish. Bearish engulfing candle as well as a close below the uptrend line. Expecting a lot more selling tomorrow and see what it does with 1600 support. 

[And a recap of QQQ:](https://i.imgur.com/iOYUaGj.png) Daily chart isn't very telling, but today we actually saw some selling with volume (though volume was really anemic between lunch and the last minute before close, very weird). Opened near the 200 MA, got rejected hard and dropped to 170ish and bounced hard but made 3 lower highs.

Adderall is great for research, prep, making a gameplan and measuring your risk before the market starts.

But once it does you need to be in a calmer, more zen state. You have to be objective, flexible, and able to shift in and out between longer and shorter time frames. Adderall, once your adrenaline gets pumping, causes your lizard brain to overwhelm you. You take huge positional risks, get over confident or conversely get gripped by panic and fear. 

I'll give examples. At one point near the bottom of this market I loaded up and bought LEAPS calls on AMZN at $1400, MSFT $100, AAPL $155, and BA $300. Then a lil while later Tim Cook opened his mouth about upcoming earnings disappointments and I dumped everything. I was on adderall when I dumped and completely regretted it.

Another big problem is chasing. I was in on pot stocks earlier this year and adderall warped my view that things would keep going up forever. If a stock went down, I kept throwing more and more money at it hoping to average down and cash out big. I didn't. I got burnt.

23,2019-02-08,"So it sounds to me like the issue is a mixture of Robinhood fucking up and retardation. 

This guy entered a put credit spread on Amzn which means he is buying and selling put options to hedge his position. Yesterday it was announced that incredibly important insight on Bezos's ability to lead the company would be forthcoming in the form of dick pics, such news blindsided OPs perfectly constructed analysis and leaves him in a bad spot with his spread expiring today. This is where Robinhood fucks OP. The whole point of the spread is so that each side of the position (long and short) covers the other's liability. However when his short position got assigned and he is now required to purchase $170k worth of Amzn, Robinhood didn't automatically exit the puts he bought to cover the cost. So now he still has one side of his spread still up, and the underlying still moving with the chance to seriously fuck him over by exiting each side of his position at different prices. So in effect he was trading two naked positions. 

Here's where the retardation comes in. Instead of trying to immediately contact rh (I know contacting them is a big xd but they might make an exception since he is potentially burning through hundreds of thousands of their monopoly money) he makes comments to the effect of ""maybe rh and the US government won't notice if he doesn't post on reddit"" ??? And then posts anyways? Also the ""I'm going to give them $120 as a token of good will"" instead of getting the hell out of the rest of his spread. Idk how any of that is supposed to make sense.

Tldr: Robinhood fucked up exiting his spread, but then OP does extremely questionable things to solve the issue. I wouldn't start celebrating the second coming of 1R0NYMAN just yet as that $170k exercised against him will probably be covered by the puts he bought.

**Also before you accept this as a suitable answer, wait and see if someone responds telling me I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. Because OP is saying he needs Amzn to rally to dig himself out of the hole, but from my understanding if he has a put credit spread, he has puts he sold (which were assigned) and puts he bought (which he would want the price to further decrease). I'd like to be corrected if I'm wrong on those details but either way I'm pretty sure the rest is accurate. ",macdshifty,wallstreetbets,23.0

I think he did respond somewhere that he didn't want to pay for realtime quotes on the Etrade app or something of that nature but I can't find the post, can anyone search the post history on that to see the response?  I can't remember the exacts but it struck me as extraordinarily odd considering the millions in portfolio coupled with the fact that he had stated the options desk VP on speed dial at E-trade but not real time quotes on the app.  Someone with a 10+ million dollar portfolio with active multiple million $ options trades not having realtime quotes doesn't sound right to me.

Maybe he takes a mandatory waiting period of x days after a big L before making other trades from something he's learned in the past (maybe he's blown up accounts in the past revenge trading and has limits he follows now and has kept him in the game for so long with good success).  Possible this is nothing big to him at all (this could be a lunch money trade for him) or he could have more losses than we know of in other accounts.   Or x number of other variables that have nothing to do with anything here.   
2.  He's works with or is close with someone who has the actual portfolio but it isn't his money/he doesn't have any say in the portfolio decisions other than to simply look at it.  Ala his bosses/companies/family/neighbors portfolio who doesn't care if they screenshot their portfolio and show him the current trades when they are with him at lunch or whatever.  He fills in the rest of the story and adds his own persona and takes it from there to reddit to WSB.              
3.  It's a fake profile, WSB got catfished, lots of people ate it up and this story potentially gets super sad if it's actually a depressed 50 year old person living in a van down by the river with great wifi.

If you believe fundamentals have a short-term impact, then you have to come up with a story on why AMZN dropped 35% despite ramming earnings for the past year and having a rock hard future gushing new products on the faces of happy customers.

The limp, sad, cocked-to-the-side truth of the last dump is that money managers took profits on positions, reallocated capital, and then went to bed because they were tired and you're all sitting there imagining huge problems.

8,2019-02-11,"http://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/

This is a good calculator and should help explain different types of spreads to you. 

The reason brokerages let you sell cash-covered puts is because your maximum loss is the strike price x number of shares. This is also a good way to offset the cost of the shares if you want to buy them anyways. Even with naked puts, your maximum loss is limited.

The reason brokerages don’t allow most people to sell naked calls is because your maximum loss is UNLIMITED. Yes, most options expire worthless and most aren’t exercised early. But if they are exercised, you could very well fuck yourself deep into a hole. Let’s say you sell a naked FOTM AMZN 1900c. Let’s say Bezos announces himself emperor of the universe. Bam, Amazon to the moon, hits 2500. Your call gets exercised. You are now on the hook for buying 100 shares of AMZN at a rapidly rising market price in order to cover your call. You are shit out of luck for a minimum of a 60k loss because your broker will buy the shares at market. 

This is how we see accounts that are -4000%.

17,2019-03-05,"I think your simply wrong. Many Individual stocks often will follow their indices, such as SPY, but there are plenty of stocks that are weaker or stronger than SPY on a given day and have better opportunities to enter or exit. 

Look at FB, AMZN, TSLA and GS. FB and AMZN we’re significantly stronger than the rest of the market today. TSLA was much weaker than SPY. You did not see it mostly recover into close. GS largely mirrored SPY’s fall and recovery. Holding GS calls would’ve been basically the same as SPY calls. However, FB and AMZN calls would have retained much more of their value and mostly recovered into the close. 

AMZN fell some before bouncing strongly and ending up. FB fell some, but bounced and closed high. AMZN and FB did not go green to red like SPY and they did not close red for the day.

They also stopped using Visa in a lot of stores, I'm sure anyone who got through the line and went to pay just left it all there.  Who buys groceries with cash?!  But that's what? 2% KR saves without Visa if they make it through.  

Every Kroger I go in is always packed.  Even if it's trashy.  Every King Soopers I've seen is always packed.  

The new parking spots they have for people picking up and get their groceries delivered to their car haven't been full but there are people using it. KR gas is always pumping and is even competitive with Costco prices if you spend enough.

I think it's safe to say that you'd need more than level 0, so you'd have to request access with your broker. This generally involves having a decent account size and saying you ""a lot of experience"" trading stocks and options - whether that's verifiable or not has never been an issue, in my exp.

Google ""highest implied volatility options"" and you'll find some resources. In general, stocks that make big percentage moves daily (weed stocks, TSLA, etc.) will have juicier premiums. Premiums also get very high for expiration the week of earnings, but this is definitely not for beginners. I've never sold more than a week out. Mostly only several days out.

If you manage to get the correct options level access. I think it's very reasonable to sell 1 or 2 contracts of something just to get a feel for how everything works. Do this with a low to mid stock price (not AMZN lol).

3,2019-03-09,"So I ran over the [Dark Pool buying](https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix?) + [Smart Money Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_money_index) thing I posted [about earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ayv9hm/weekend_discussion_thread_march_810_2019/ei3jky9/). Here's an update with Friday's information. 

My process is this: I look over the list Squeeze Metrics puts out for subscribers that lists unusual dark pool buying or selling activity. If I see a name pop up a couple of times, I cross reference it with the Smart Money Index to see if the broader market confirms. 

I also sometimes check out particular names I'm interested in that don't necessarily pop up on that ""unusual acitvity"" list. SAP was one such catch. Next time I'm going to try and keep my personal/subjective picks on a separate list. 

**Lots of Dark Pool Buying + SMI trending or reversing upwards:**

1. ABB 
2. AMZN
3. BCS
4. C
5. **DWDP** (was on my previous list)
6. IVZ
7. JNUG
8. **MO** (was on my previous list)
8. MOMO (earnings this week)
9. NEM
10. **SAP** (was on my previous list)
10. SOGO
11. SRPT
12. WFC
13. **XOM** (was on my previous list)

Changes from previous list:

- Dark pool buying volume or proportion of buying for FOXA, ITUB, LLY, NKTR, NTNX, ORCL, and TSM dropped off considerably Friday. 

- RIO had an increase in dark pool selling Friday, but Thursday was also its ex-dividend date, so that may have played a role. 

**Lots of Dark Pool Selling + SMI trending or reversing downwards:**

1. BGS
2. DFEN
3. DUST
4. INGN
5. PRS
6. PRA

Notes on this list:

- CQQQ and KWEB have appeared on the ""unusual selling"" list but SMI isn't showing a confirmation. Similarly, INDL (the 3x leveraged India Bull ETF), EWW (Mexico ETF) have all had unusual selling this week, and YINN (3x China bull ETF) and EEM (Emerging Markets ETF) popped up yesterday but again the SMI isn't clear.  

- TSLA likewise has seen heavy dark pool selling these past few days but isn't being confirmed by the SMI. It's notable that before Musk's big announcement about the cheaper model 3, they were however doing lots of buying.

- IAU (gold ETF) has been on the unusual selling list a lot, but SMI isn't confirming and it seems odd that there'd be buying of gold miners and selling of miner bear ETFs at the same time. 

**Broad Sector/Index Notes:**

1. SPY: Increased dark pool buying each of the last three days
2. QQQ: Increased

Other notes:

- Last week/early this week saw lots of selling of small caps and biotech. Friday though saw heavy buying of TNA, the 3x small cap bull etf. IWM and XBI also seem to be trending upwards in regards to proportion (but not aggregate volume) of buying:selling.

- Thursday saw lots of buying in FB and selling of SQQQ. Friday reversed that, with FB seeing lots of dark pool selling and QQQ and TQQQ getting sold. 

- FANG names are mixed. AMZN, BABA, NFLX seem strong. BIDU, FB, NVDA, TSLA, and TWTR seem weak. AAPL and GOOG flat/holding steady. ",FireSail,wallstreetbets,3.0

&amp;#x200B;

AMZN is big dick option trading. But I follow SQ daily. Did you make money today?  


What's helped me is sticking to day trading, or EOD buying if I think there is a good chance for a gap. EX SQ trading down, and diverging from buying pressure in QQQ, I might look into calls (like yesterday) .  Also, when I'm in a follow 5-min price action of the underlying like a hawk, stick to hard mental stop losses.  Don't be afraid to take a loss, delta is at least on your side, so a gap against you won't hurt as much as a gap in your favor will help.  


If I see a good profit, I take it, and don't 'HOPE' for more unless there is hard evidence it will keep pumping, like if the whole market is surging.  Even still I'm watching 5-min candles for an exit or a top.  I cashed out 40% today and 25% yesterday from a call and a put, respectively, when I could have held for 100%+ in both cases.  But I'm happy and would do the same again because I stick to my style. 

&amp;#x200B;

Profit is profit, it is our job to take money away from the market, no matter how big or small.  All that matters is we hit sell and actually realize the gain before it vanishes into a loss and then expires to zero.

15,2019-05-03,"Oh hey dude it's you!  Didn't look at the name until now.

The reason is because I don't really need the collateral, it hasn't constrained me vs any trade I've wanted to make at all.  This is my active account, which is linked to my passive account, and that account is much bigger and provides a lot of margin.  I (up until Wednesday) was using considerable margin shorting volatility (250% short maintainance requirement), and now I'm using that margin writing naked puts on high-IV stocks.  I was always doing that, but I'm doing it more now.  I think for me, right now, considering the use of cash going long and paying interest, I would rather be short puts, collecting cash, having theta on my side, and having directionally bullish trades... that *seems to be* the best use of margin to me right now.

The AMZN spreads are big - I have 4 bull spreads at 1700/1740 (was a little early on that one) and 2 at 1600/1640.  So 16K maintenance + 8K.  Credits collected there were bigger than FB, total $13K.

AAPL I have some nice ones, 25 160/165, 10 180/185, and 10 195/200 for June 2019 I'm glad I didn't panic close.

NFLX it's the same shit, they're all pretty big trades (for me).

Unrealized I'm already up huge but I'll of course ride it out.  Think I'm up about $4-5K, some days these leaps don't trade so the prices can be stale at my broker.


I opened even bigger ones on AMZN, AAPL and a similar sized one on NFLX and SPY around the same time.  Total credit in was maybe $50K?  They are all in max profit position with a lot of breathing room.

20,2019-05-03,"Story:

I had sold a $1910 put and $2005 call for about $1110 total credit.

Closed the $2005 call and decided to move the short call down because AMZN was around $1890-1900 yesterday and my put was in trouble. Figured that I ""may as well collect credit"" if shit is gonna take a dump. Received $227 credit for the position (cost $8 to close/roll the $2005 to $1920). Since the put was ITM and losing, the plan was to roll the put to another week for a credit if it opened around that range, and eventually have it expire OTM while being ahead.

I did NOT expect stupid Buffett/Berkshire Hathaway to announce that they've been buying AMZN lately. 

The plan now is to close/roll the call higher, and hope AMZN stabilizes so that I can come out ahead eventually. Will also be selling another put for another week.

The $1920 call closed the day with a last trading price of $1.79. In the screenshot it is worth $43.19, so about a 24 bagger (for the person buying it).

3,2019-05-09,"Damn, sorry for your loss. I've sold naked puts on a stock that's moved 20% but never more than that.

Selling naked puts on a volitile stock around earnings isn't necessarily a bad idea, but you need to manage your risk properly. You normally want to sell OTM at least 2 times the expected move, and at least a month out. So in this case, if you sold the 45 puts in June, you would be still be sitting on a large paper loss, but the risk of assignment would be much lower.

Only problem is you wouldn't have been able to sell the June 45 puts anyways, since there were no bids and no open interest. Which leads me to my other word of advice; make sure there is plenty of liquidity on the options you're selling.

Don't let this stop you from selling options. I had a large drawdown on some SPX options I sold earlier this year. I took the L and moved on, but I've already made back a good chunk of that loss selling spreads on high IV stocks like TSLA and AMZN.",wafflerdeluxe,wallstreetbets,3.0

2,2019-05-10,"Ok, I know this is only to you at this point but I can break it down. It's one of many red flags.

First, look at the last bull run as two segments. Up to 3/4/19 which started a pullback and from the end of that to now. Volume is down on the second segment. Red flag #1. Generally, you need volume to continue an upward trend.

Volatility, had gone down steadily with regular small rises since the correction. Then after 3/25 volatility experiences a prolonged lull. As Bollinger says, low volatility leads to high volatility and vice versa. Seems completely obvious but it's easy to forget a simple things like that. Red flag #2. This helps you determine when to buy in on TVIX as well. When I said I went cash, I did keep TVIX as it's not a market play, but market volatility play. I began those positions the second week of April and averaged down some after that. Market weakness isn't necessary for this, just lack of volatility leading to volatility is inevitable.

Speaking of Bollinger, his bands are shrinking, normal for low volatility. Red flag #3 which helps confirm #2. SPY broke the band for the first time since Oct today actually. 

The up and down trends have shortened over the last few weeks. SPY was walking the Bollinger Bands before, now it's just happy to touch it and come back down. Shows weakness. Red flag #4

We finally make it all the way to where we started in Sept. and the price action gets very weak. Hits the now ATH and it just plummets. The second top doesn't even make it back up to the high. That is not strong in the least bit. If SPY had kept pushing right on up 2 or 3 more points then there would be some strength. Just breaking a high by .34% is not something to get excited about. Red flag #5. This occurs very often before large pullbacks or corrections. This one was quick, some happen over a few more days. 

The 10 year - 2 year plummets on the 5/1. Red flag #6 that really raises alarms when adding the above to it. You can use various methods to analyze treasury yields, the 10-2 just has some patterns I hone in on better.

The market has been weak since early April. Just because it still went up doesn't mean there is strength. I was tempted to stop mid April but the treasury yields were what finally signaled to me that it was close. Does China affect this? Of course, but we're also not here because of China, it is just one part of it. Literally everything I cited happened before the tweet. 

Oh, I forgot the biggest red flag. I bought AMZN bull debit spreads at the low on 4/30. Last time I bought AMZN before that was 10/1/18.",dunnoaboutthat,wallstreetbets,2.0

also buy dividend companies, small consistent profits every time adds up over 30-40 years. try to avoid dino companies like AT&amp;T and GME. it probably wont exist in 30 years.

0,2019-06-07,"Actually it is a lot more complex than just the futures. These big fund managers use future contracts as a ""hedge"" for the most part but the futures can also indicate general market sentiment before cash open. 

They buy or sell indexes like XLF(financials), SMH(Semiconductors), XLT(Technology) which are the three key indexes that directly affect price of SPY. Then they can also buy sell one of the monster constituents of SPY individually to affect SPY price. SPY has 500 stocks, but it is not equal weighted. BA, AMZN, AAPL, FB, MSFT, GOOGL are one of the biggest constituents by market cap. If someone wants to tank SPY, selling one or two of these stocks so they are down a lot for one day will directly affect SPY and prevent it from rallying, even causing it to go red. Same applies for financials XLF. In order for a perfect SPY rally to happen, financials techs and semis should all run. Then there is the whole bond market, example ETF would be TLT. If those rally, financials tank and thus SPY tanks. 

Market makers always hedge and have neutral positions so they make money on either case. Correct, options pricing does not fluctuate based on how many options contract are bought. Options pricing depends on the usual underlying stock's implied move (IV), stock price and expiry. But when market tanks, and volatility picks up it juices up the options pricing.",uninfinity,wallstreetbets,0.0
1,2019-06-07,"yeah one of the good random buy was PNRA as i mentioned. i had about 4k in those and i remember selling it at around 22k.

honestly only like a few worked out. everything else kind of stay stagnant and/or went bankrupt. USG was one of those dud.

one thing of note that are new to ""investing"" is that value investing is kinda dead (not that what i was doing was value investing). the growth from tech stock eclipse traditional companies and fundamental by leaps and bound. so really some of those traditional blue chips haven't really made any major move in quite awhile.

5,2019-06-07,"Super smart! 

You're still losing on theta decay overnight but is that amount somehow lower if you buy it right before close and do we have leeway the next morning before theta decay goes into effect?

+15 from the current trading price of AMZN ($1749) is 0.8576% so now I understand why you favor AMZN for this strategy :)

My strategy was similar to yours but I wanted to sell OTM credit spreads that expires the next day for just few % profit. Both I think is a very interesting play using short expiration date to our advantage! Yours might be little riskier because you're buying calls that expires the next day so you need it to not go down or trade sideways to make money whereas I would make money as long as it doesn't end over my shortest call credit spread leg.

Will definitely try both to see and compare! :)",Loudinside2,wallstreetbets,5.0

Got it paid off eventually and bought C, LVS, F, and AMZN.

I will wait until ATM options are around $400. Then I'll make a decision on which way the trend could go and buy and ATM call or put (You could also go riskier with up to .30 delta or even buy a straddle but then you need bigger moves). Gamma is so high ATM on expiry day that the price will whipsaw with any small movements on the price.

If you own the stock already you will just sell those shares, but it sounds like you did not own AMZN so you would sell shares you don’t have (sell short). You would see $180,000 in cash in your account as well as -100 AMZN shares. The risk being AMZN moving up a lot before you can close the short and you’re out some cash.

I suppose this depends on your account size and broker, it’s also possible your broker wouldn’t allow you to have that size of a short position and would essentially do it all for you at once.

If you had a call it would be the scenario you described where you buy the shares and in that case you’d have $180,000 less cash in your account and 100 AMZN shares.

Dark pool stuff operates on a longer time line, it's used as a way for institutions to quietly accumulate or distribute shares without moving bid/ask spreads and forcing the price in a certain direction. So maybe if we see another week or two of sustained selling it's more bearish. I personally just keep it in the back of my mind within the greater context of things.

We have three gap fills above, indicated by shaded boxes. The bottoms and tops of the boxes are resistance levels, which I've labeled with prices. Key resistance above: 1815, 1836, 1850, 1873ish. And gap fill way up at 1908 and 1917. 

I think AMZN will staircase its way up all the way to 1872/3/4ish area and then pull back 1836 on 6/18, where it will bounce and continue its trend back up.

Ok kids. gather around papa! Time to preach

FOMC is next week. The market is trying to price in a rate cut as we speak based on the choppy action you have seen in the past 2 days.

It would be advisable to stop taking risks on mega caps, large caps and the index options as we navigate these choppy waters. Search for niche companies which do not follow the trend of the index. That might be BYND, TSLA, TLRY etc etc.. So you get the message, ya meme stocks basically. 

This FOMC is going to be a huge huge catalyst event. How to play it Papa???? Well Papa Ashes is going to have a \~40$ strangle FDS on AMZN before FOMC. 

1. Rate cut: Market will instantly spike up. Have a day trade available but do not hastily close the losing position. Let the market digest the news. Once direction is clear those amzns fds will be worth 5-10x their original price and you will recover cost of your strangle too.
2. Rate steady and they say we will think next fomc: Market will crash like nothing else and we likely will see 272-275 before we ever see 294 on SPY. Again AMZN fds will be 5-10x if not more if you hold them from Wednesday-Friday or even Thursday mid day.

&amp;#x200B;

Bonus freebie from Papa because WSB LOVES TA so much. 

The stock that I am most interested in aside from AMZN as a play beyond FOMC is Facebook (FB)

/u/yolosense : There is cup and handle formation on the weekly for FB.

[Facebook Weekly Chart with C&amp;H](https://imgur.com/rYQhocH)

Again how to play this, if rates are cut, there is huge huge upside to FB because of economic events + C&amp;H formation. Calls on this once event is completed. Massive upside with ATH target.

If rates are not cut, this formation will obviously break and the handle will be an avalanche fall back to base of the cup of even further. So puts on this.

Yes there might privacy issues and red taping for FB in the future, but as option traders our job is to get in and get out within 2-3days and this works best. Advice is to preserve capital till FOMC.

7,2019-06-12,"I base my short term investments and option plays on fake news. I've found that the most reliable. Latest example: antitrust case on FB, GOOG, AMZN. That day everything dropped. So it was obviously a fake drop to companies not associated with the cases, so buy companies that have nothing to do with the news. I chose cloud companies. They all recovered to near all time highs. Another one was TWLO making more shares available. It was 750m worth. Nothing in grand scheme. Drop was fake. I don't blindly buy on news like this. I look at charts and if it dropped substantially below its trading range over the last month or so, it's a good bet it'll recover. My most recent one (the one I'm in now) is CRMs drop from 167 to currently 151. It's from the acquisition of a company that'll make it a lot better. In this case a drop is warranted due to earnings changes and some share dillution. With that said, it hasn't been in 140s forever so unlikely any way but up. Its normal trading range during bad news month in may was 155.

Anyway, to me news and events are best way to get safe bets on stocks. TA works, but I'm not entirely sure there's any basis for it to work. I think the only reason it might work is because it's a self fulfilling prophecy. It's like if TA shows a breakout point is 103.5, then the stock goes higher than 103.5 and it shoots up to 120 in 10minutes. Why do you think that happened? Probably because all the algos and all the TA analysts, and all the news articles written for dumb people said that if price goes above 103.5 then it's a buypoint. So what does everyone do? They buy. So this stuff only works because everyone believes it works. Just my opinion.

As for indicators I use. Mostly volume. Some 50d and 200d moving averages. And I know they say past performance is not indicator of previous performance, but I don't buy that. I look at the last 1-3 months to see how it's been trading, and as long as no different company specific news comes out and earnings aren't soon then it's likely going to trade in a range so I buy low end of range. I almost never buy a stock that hasn't been above my buy price on multiple occasions recently.",Zer033x,wallstreetbets,7.0

19,2019-07-08,"It’s a 2% tax on wealth you have over $50 million, and another 1% on wealth over $1 billion.  My guess is 1 or 2 of us here would be impacted (if the people are telling the truth, which to be honest I don’t really care if they are or not).

The most detailed proposal I saw exempted your primary residence (presuming up to a certain dollar value, but it didn’t specify) and your 401(k).

So if you had a TDA (or RH account) with over $50 million in AAPL or AMZN or MSFT or whatever, then each year you’d need to shell out $1 million a year.  Lately those companies have managed to do that, but you would need to sell shares, find cash elsewhere, or maybe write options against those shares to make sure you could cover it.

Supposedly it’s to help ensure that people with extreme wealth pay “fair” taxes.  We can argue fairness and equality on other subs, but from what I can see it would incentivize you to make sure that money makes decent returns… or to hide it even harder.

Compliance would likely be challenging overall, people would find ways to have homes/boats/planes/whatever by difficult to track entities, but trading accounts would be easy as they already report holdings/gains/losses to the government.

The proposals that would actually impact WSBers is the tax per transaction some senators have proposed.  Maybe 0.5% of the total value of each transaction.  Let’s say you buy $10k worth of call options expiring in a week because you think it’s going up big.  Then they drop to $1k a day later, you sell.  You pay $50 the first time, then $5 when you close the position.  Or you’re a baller and you buy $1,000,000 in shares, so that’s $5,000.  Then a year later shit went up like 1% and is now worth $1,010,000 but you’re tired of holding so you unload it, but that costs you $5,050.

•Amazon's margin expansion trajectory will probably be uneven at times, given its global logistics requirements, content investments, increased competition, and physical store/healthcare initiatives.

•International expansion brings unique challenges such as local e-commerce regulations, fulfillment infrastructure investments, and incumbent competition in several markets.

•Certain AWS offerings face competition from well-capitalized peers like Microsoft Azure and Google, possibly exposing it to more aggressive price competition and longer-term margin expansion constraints.

37,2019-07-09,"1. if your theory is true... sell puts on AMZN.. its free money. Its not true btw. AMZN will tank with the rest of the market when we get no rate cut.  

2. Do more research into public cloud space. You'll find AMZN is overpriced and getting picked apart by competitors.

3. Is this point in regard to having a cheaper ecommerce web/app presence? It really doesnt take much money to spin up an online shop, but name brand and shipping logistics network would be AMZNs real advantage here.

4 and 5. Anti-trust cases are focusing more on GOOGL and FB more than AMZN for a split up.

17,2019-07-11,"I don't think there is actual a bear gang. I think cautious has been misrepresented as bearish. I am not bullish just because job data is good and rate cuts initially only help the market for a short while. That being said like I said I am not bearish yet. You got to just respect the charts imo even though I am not a TA guy.

So as someone who is cautious I still trade many high growth stocks on the long side but in my investment portfolio I mainly have cash/bonds/gold/few utility stocks and 1-2 \*safe equities like MACD/DIS.  

Every time I think the market is too high I do buy a bit of protection on the side. Like yesterday I had AMZN/GOOGL/AMD calls, some which I sold and some I kept but I also bought some SQQQ calls that were RIDICULOUSLY cheap.

There is lots of uncertainty right now in the global economic system so you have to be a bit cautious just incase shit hits the fan like in 07-08.

The contract-award process for the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure program, known as JEDI, had been marred by conflict-of-interest allegations.

8,2019-08-03,"But that's misleading.   Amazon didnt pay income tax largely because it reinvested the 11b in profits instead of realizing the gains, and carrying over losses from previous years.  
  
Amazon has spent $160B since 2011 investing in its distribution network, planes, drones, technology, cloud, analytics, warehouses, robots, wind/solar farms etc etc etc.   

Companies can also deduct depreciable properties at once (like the new warehouses it built) to reduce their taxable income.  

Politicians cry foul during campaigns,  but the current corporate tax system was designed *BY CONGRESS* to encourage investment and research and development (which will eventually pay dividends in taxable income) and let companies realize losses when they become profitable.  I.e. amazon is profitable now, but its carrying over deductions from when it was losing money.  Amazon generated losses and tax credits faster that it generated taxable income and liability.  It's still rolling over billions of dollars in credits.  

I feel like its intentionally oversimplified to be misleading.  The average joe (and politician) doesnt know shit about the tax code, let alone taxes on a multi billion dollar global corporation.   

It seems like fuckery, but restricted stock grants can write off more than what was actually granted (if the stock is doing well...like amzn).   The deduction isnt set until the grant vests.  The company can write off the expense of giving the employee the grant.  For example, company x issues 1 stock grant at the current share price of $100.   They paid $100 so they should be able to deduct $100. BUT, If the stock price rises before the grant is realized to $200, the company can take a $200 deduction even though they only spent $100 (bc that's what the grant is worth)   

This isn't amazon playing fuckery.   Amazon stock just happened to go up a fuckin lot over the last few years, so this was very lucrative for both parties (employee and company). 


It also doesnt take into consideration the amount of payroll taxes, income taxes, state and local taxes, sales tax etc that amazon generated.   

Tl;dr there arent enough companies and rich people to raise taxes on to pay for ""free shit 2020"".  Increasing taxes on corporations means less investment, fewer jobs etc which lower future tax contributions.",chefandy,wallstreetbets,8.0

Hmm my moves tomorrow..

Well I was going to play LYFT earnings and had 2 contracts of 67.5 which I cashed out at close and didn't play LYFT earnings. So I am happy since they would have been IV crushed.

STMP: pretty much going to hold both options until expiry (30p and 70c). If they keep their gains, expect a squeeze on STMP.

MSFT calls: 137c fd, will take a call EOD tomorrow to cut or let it run through Friday.

w.r.t swinging stocks

Swinging AMZN since 1776 (ha tht worked out)

AMD (in at 28.88). Hoping these gains hold and Su Bae showers me with tendies.. might update stops to get the most out of this.

\----------------

No TA or anything: But have a feeling DIS is going to start moving up soon.. Might take 3-4 days.

\-----------------

Ok TIME for some TA... now please bear in mind that this is just TA and one news event or tweet will run this. But if no bad news etc happens..  VISA($V) and MSFT ($MSFT) are looking RIPE to move up after being oversold on many TA indicators (MACD,RSI,Full STO)

CNBC broke out the yuan news flipping futures. Lets see what happens. Today's market red to green showed that the market was going through price discovery and might just rip up tomorrow.

Tesla is the short everyone keeps waiting on but never happens.

20,2019-09-03,"I got some DD on ULTA from a former member of the BECKY class who's moved on to bigger and better things. ULTA caters not to THOTS but rather women who want quality makeup at a decent price. It's not Maybelline or Cover Girl or whatever but shit from the Macy's counter without the markup. I asked specifically about ULTA providing some sort of quality experience and she clearly said no that wasn't their game and that she would gladly order from AMZN once they move into this space full throttle. A not insignificant number of ULTA shoppers are experienced as fuck and already know what they want and therefore don't need to be catered to or upsold in any way. The fly in the ointment for ULTA is that if AMZN pulls the trigger in a big way and say partners with influencers or whatever, a big chunk of these kinds of shoppers need not ever step foot in an ULTA ever again.

LULU on the other hand is fashion and strictly that, no matter how much of a lifestyle they try to attach to it. Ride that train for now bc hypebeasts gonna hype but the energy they have behind them surely seems like it could be replaced by the next big thing at any time.

Lost a ""significant amount"" the other week and wasn't feeling too great (95k). Took a break from shitposting in order to concentrate and focus on making money even though I still modded around here. Have made about 75-80% of the losses back and am within striking distance of my ATH. Am still trying to improve as a trader. Losses were mostly from futures because I have a hard time taking small losses, and my position size was too large. Today I plan to take profits and go short if /ES goes to the 2935-2940 range. I have contracts on all the indices and will close out all and focus on scalping ES afterwards. If /ES doesn't reach my profit taking zone, I may close out above my stop loss and enter short if that seems to be the direction it's going. Other than futures, I am still playing with AMZN, TSLA, NDX, and SPX. Short calls on AMZN are in trouble if the market continues up. Short call strikes of 1815, 1835, and 1850 for this week.

Few other ones includes:

QQQintheass: Bets apple will go down. Apple goes up and he lost I think 40k. Posts about it and says he is going to sell. Later in the day or the next day, trump tweets about china and everything goes down. The same tweet actually got analman famous.

&amp;#x200B;

Beautifulname: Her story is a sad one and I will provide a very short summary. While in China, her dad died and she received either workers compensation or life insurance money. She wanted to leave China tho and fought her family in court for her share of the money. Also, her dad's boss was sexual harassing her. When she got the money, she applied at a college in NY and left. She then used the money she got to pay tutions and the remaining went straight into AMZN calls. As it was declining, she added more and more money into buying calls. Anywho, she lost everything she put in and was suicidal. She planned to kill herself as she didn't have the funds for next semester and didn't want to go back to her family obviously. I think she is still alive, I reached to her a while back and don't know how she is doing now.

&amp;#x200B;

YY kid: This 13 year old got the most upvoted post on this sub.

&amp;#x200B;

That amex guy: A month ago, someone borrowed money from Amex and his plays didn't work out.

&amp;#x200B;

That oil guy: A banned user decided to make a new user account to participate in this sub. He then makes a post predicting the price of oil and if it was correct, well he made money. He then makes another post stating he was right and was obviously excited. No proof tho, we just had to take his word. Mods ask for proof in the dms and he sends out this very long ass comment as why he won't and is taking an ethical stand and how he is going to be banned again. TBH I didn't even read that shit and who would? all the mods asked was pictures. But the mods accept his reasoning and let the post stay. The comments were talking about how much he made etc.. when this dumbass replies to one of the comments and sends a picture. Now this picture is obliviously altered and everyone noticed the calculations (from his account) didn't add up. It was the same thread as the mod who asked for pictures. Cant make this shit up, Lmao he got ban within seconds and the post is locked.

Why does everyone think people just have a handful of really expensive options?  Sure, you buy 1 AMZN call for $10k, or you can also buy 100 AMD calls for $10k.  If you deal with cheap stocks, that $1.30 to open &amp; close adds up.",mis-Hap,wallstreetbets,0.0

Strangles work well *most* of the times (GOOG, AMZN, SQ, TWTR etc..), but in the rare case (e.g TSLA's last earnings), an IC would be the only way to protect you and strangles could wipe out all the gains you made in the past few months and then some..

----------
Edit: Just incase OP deletes this post I have it save: 

For all you autists out there this is the method for the all new, Robinhood Infinite Money Glitch! What you have to do is find a company that offers high payouts for short term, low risk iron condors. For example you can buy two out of the money calls and two in the money puts and still get offered $30 for every $100 you spend, or an even better amount like I’ve been finding, example $50 for every $100 I spend, (and buy $100 I mean 1 iron condor and for $30 and $50 I mean the min credit you’d be receiving for buying 1 iron condor) and since these calls and puts are always very far away from the actual stock price you have a very low chance of the iron condor actually failing you if the stock goes up or down.

I’ve been doing this to FB, TTWO, GOOGL, and AMZN. For example this iron condor is on TTWO (take two interactive), for the iron condor, I’m selling a 130 call, buying a 131 call, selling a 117 put, and buying a 116 put all expiring 12/6, and the price of TTWO is now $121. (LOOK AT THE PICTURES) The limit price for this trade is .03 but with the crazy bid ask spread price that happens after hours, Robinhood will ask you to put in your own limit price of .95 specifically for this trade, you’ll put that in the limit price section, then you will make $95 instead of $3 with an $100 collateral, and once Friday comes along you will have made $195 off of a $100 trade!

(Next few sentences is pretty much what I just said but these sentences go for any stock and not just TTWO) Then what you do is buy however many iron condors of this trade you want. When you accept everything on the order page of the iron condor, it will ask you credit or debit, choose credit, then it will say this iron condor has a special bid ask spread and it will ask you to choose a limit price. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT! Right then and there you have to choose the special bid ask spread in the limit price section. In my example it gave me a .95 limit price giving me $95 for every $100 iron condor. Then you place the order and it will get placed when the market opens (or by the end of the market day).

If the order doesn’t get placed because the limit price is too high, try lowering it by .10, if you can’t completely double your money with this iron condor this method will still work as long as you gain 50% of what the colateral cost is, so if you’re lucky and can find a regular iron condor offering 50% of what the colateral cost is, then you don’t even have to mess around with the limit price and that will insure the order gets placed! And yes you need someone to actually sell you the iron condor too and that’s what makes this glitch awesome as it gets filled with this ridiculous limit price.

IF YOU’RE CONFUSED LOOK AT THE PICTURES AT THE END OF THIS POST AND THAT WILL HELP EXPLAIN EVERYTHING! Yes this does seem to be a somewhat weird iron condor trade so far but here’s the thing, you’re doubling the money your investing using margin so margin will also double the total amount of money it can lend to you, this will lead to unlimited gains/money! Then you keep on doing this method until this glitch gets patched and then we can all buy out google, we’ll all run the board and then we can take out assets and throw one huge damn party!!!!!

See you all on Bloomberg, CNBC, CNN, Market Watch, Buisness Insider and Fox! By the way I can’t figure out a way to show my margin doubling so the picture is of GUH instead! I love you all wallstreetbets! Promise too bail me out of prison if the SEC finds me! GUH’s speed to all of you degenerates! PICTURES OF HOW TO DO THIS EXPLOIT PROOF I’M GOING ALL IN

Edit 1: and when I say you receive $195 I mean that’s how much money you’ll get back that margin will double! GUH’s speed to all of you degenerates!

Edit 2 (3:54PM December 1st 2019): Jartek (creator of WSB) has stickied my post to the top of WSB and proved my credibility that this method does in fact work. I will not post any pictures of the specific past trades I have done even to prove credibility because if I do that I I’ll in fact get caught and probably get in trouble. Though I did send those pictures to Jartek to prove my credibility to him. Also I added paragraphs for you autist degenerates who don’t know how to read a big chuck of writing.

&gt;Yes this does seem to be a somewhat weird iron condor trade so far but here’s the thing, you’re doubling the money your investing using margin so margin will also double the total amount of money it can lend to you, this will lead to unlimited gains/money! Then you keep on doing this method until this glitch gets patched and then we can all buy out google, we’ll all run the board and then we can take out assets and throw one huge damn party!!!!!   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;See you all on Bloomberg, CNBC, CNN, Market Watch, Buisness Insider and Fox! By the way I can’t figure out a way to show my margin doubling so the picture is of GUH instead!

2,2019-12-04,"ROBINHOOD INFINITE MONEY GLITCH STEP BY STEP TUTORIAL

For all you autists out there this is the method for the all new, Robinhood Infinite Money Glitch! What you have to do is find a company that offers high payouts for short term, low risk iron condors. For example you can buy two out of the money calls and two in the money puts and still get offered $30 for every $100 you spend, or an even better amount like I’ve been finding, example $50 for every $100 I spend, (and buy $100 I mean 1 iron condor and for $30 and $50 I mean the min credit you’d be receiving for buying 1 iron condor) and since these calls and puts are always very far away from the actual stock price you have a very low chance of the iron condor actually failing you if the stock goes up or down. 
  
I’ve been doing this to FB, TTWO, GOOGL, and AMZN. For example this iron condor is on TTWO (take two interactive), for the iron condor, I’m selling a 130 call, buying a 131 call, selling a 117 put, and buying a 116 put all expiring 12/6, and the price of TTWO is now $121. (LOOK AT THE PICTURES) The limit price for this trade is .03 but with the crazy bid ask spread price that happens after hours, Robinhood will ask you to put in your own limit price of .95 specifically for this trade, you’ll put that in the limit price section, then you will make $95 instead of $3 with an $100 collateral, and once Friday comes along you will have made $195 off of a $100 trade!
 
 (Next few sentences is pretty much what I just said but these sentences go for any stock and not just TTWO) Then what you do is buy however many iron condors of this trade you want. When you accept everything on the order page of the iron condor, it will ask you credit or debit, choose credit, then it will say this iron condor has a special bid ask spread and it will ask you to choose a limit price. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT! Right then and there you have to choose the special bid ask spread in the limit price section. In my example it gave me a .95 limit price giving me $95 for every $100 iron condor. Then you place the order and it will get placed when the market opens (or by the end of the market day). 
  
If the order doesn’t get placed because the limit price is too high, try lowering it by .10, if you can’t completely double your money with this iron condor this method will still work as long as you gain 50% of what the colateral cost is, so if you’re lucky and can find a regular iron condor offering 50% of what the colateral cost is, then you don’t even have to mess around with the limit price and that will insure the order gets placed! And yes you need someone to actually sell you the iron condor too and that’s what makes this glitch awesome as it gets filled with this ridiculous limit price. 
  
IF YOU’RE CONFUSED LOOK AT THE PICTURES AT THE END OF THIS POST AND THAT WILL HELP EXPLAIN EVERYTHING! Yes this does seem to be a somewhat weird iron condor trade so far but here’s the thing, you’re doubling the money your investing using margin so margin will also double the total amount of money it can lend to you, this will lead to unlimited gains/money! Then you keep on doing this method until this glitch gets patched and then we can all buy out google, we’ll all run the board and then we can take out assets and throw one huge damn party!!!!!

Edit 2 (3:54PM December 1st 2019): Jartek (creator of WSB) has stickied my post to the top of WSB and proved my credibility that this method does in fact work. I will not post any pictures of the specific past trades I have done even to prove credibility because if I do that I I’ll in fact get caught and probably get in trouble. Though I did send those pictures to Jartek to prove my credibility to him. Also I added paragraphs for you autist degenerates who don’t know how to read a big chuck of writing.

More recently, it was rejected again last week at 1825 and currently weekly candle looks like ass. Cyber Monday + Black Friday hype probably helped push it up last week but it again failed to break out.

He is the comander in chief of the US military and this is a huge national defense contract, so he kinda does have a say in the matter, weather you or I agree with it or not. 

&amp;#x200B;

Orange man bad.

&gt; Do you think these reporters wouldn't have the same access to MSFT employees as they may with Amazon employees? That is silly. 

I do think this is the case and it is not at all silly. It will be more difficult for them to access classified data from MSFT employees than AMZN employees.

32,2019-12-12,"Nothing in securities markets would have anything resembling this kind of payoff from a single event.  The absolute highest potential return would be a put option on a very expensive stock like AMZN.  A $1600 put expiring in a day for example theoretically has a 160,000 for 1 payout if the stock goes to zero overnight.  Obviously that's impossible, but that's just to demonstrate how you'll never get a million to one bet, let alone 100 mil to 1.

So to make it work it has to be a series of 3 or more crazy unlikely bets that hit sequentially.  If you had to do it, I'd probably buy a super far OTM SPY put, and then on the off chance it hits repeat as many times as necessary.  However on the last time you'd already have something like 100k-1 million in hand so you would have to be really crazy to go for the 100 mil instead of stopping there.",moltress,wallstreetbets,32.0
