1,2021-01-04,"I actually don't think PLTR are bad people and I probably wouldn't invest if I did. I don't hold or trade or entertain any positions in defense. Same is true for oil.

PLTR works with both of those industries, likely because they are some of the most historically bloated industries in the world. Decades of no bid contracts, anti competition, govt subsidies, and political protections have enabled wasteful spending &amp; gluttonous dividends. These habits protect complacency within hiring and management hierarchies and created a near perfect entry for papa Thiel and Alex Karp.

PLTR is just an enterprise data OS, but they get a bad wrap because of the aforementioned terry hunting and outspoken usage of big data. MSFT &amp; GOOG &amp; AAPL all do similar stuff with data, but they aren't ""mysterious"" systems explicitly linked to profiting from killing terrys. They are simply more understood by the average consumer, and create the illusion of data privacy protections between systems.

I think PLTR is a good platform because at the core it's an efficiency platform. Yes it has fancy tech and software but it seems to do three things very well:

\- simplify the software stack

\- create business intelligence analysts from workforces with low technical skills

\- deploy engineers who enable rapid setup and user onboarding",LN-beanzo,wallstreetbets,1.0

It's the holy grail of tech and anyone who thinks the time and safety benefits, for consumer and logistical use, aren't already worth trillions of dollars has their head up their ass. Think about what percentage of time modern civilization spends driving, the loss of life involved, the amount of money circulating in logistics.

Only one company is finding success with a version of FSD that will ever be usable outside of the most meticulously mapped and updated major cities. Machine learning isn't something that's easy to rip off or replicate, it takes years and years of meticulous training and programming. This one company has also gone all-in on full vertical integration and ownership of all components of its products, making the most outlandish and bullish bet on the aforementioned multi-trillion dollar market that doesn't exist yet. They use highest grade marketing materials and an emphasis on perfect UI design like the current most valuable company in the world. The hardware doesn't need to be great to have sky high profit margins and shit all over competitors just like Apple does to Google.

Tesla is going to multiply several times over in the next five years and still be undervalued. It's like if Henry Ford had been poised to dominate the oil, shipping, and consumer transportation industries in one go. All bears can talk about is retarded QC issues from a company that was desperately trying to stay alive against massive political machinations, short sellers, and competition from the most valuable tech companies in the world. That company can now raise $5B at a time, blip their holders' share price 1%, and nobody gives a singular fuck.

I'm not saying Tesla can't be the winner at the end. I'm just saying a lot of people are looking at Tesla with blinders on and can't imagine an alternative / different picture, which is a dangerous way to trade

Also, I would argue that while there are a lot of Tesla fanatics out there - question is how many of them can actually buy / afford a Tesla today?

And, why to sell, well, that comes to the fact that GME was a particularly egregious fuck up on their part. It exposed all the counterfeit (permanently shorted / naked) shares held by institutions. 

The more research I have done, the more I find stocks where institutions report owning more than 100% of the total shares issued.

Which, while I will accept there is a time lag, so reporting could be an issue, it isn't sufficient to accept seeing it everywhere. Even 120% ownership in a name brand store.

14,2021-02-11," ""NLST is making that slow steady powerful rise up the charts in recent months that speaks of big things coming on the horizon. The stock is quickly becoming a leader in small caps regularly trading $3 million plus in daily dollar volume and attracting legions of new shareholders who continue to bid the stock higher. Many naysayers suggested the stock would drop off its July highs after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board’s decision upholding the validity of Netlist’s U.S. 7,619,912 (‘912) patent that applies to DDR server memory modules. While NLST did give back some gains at the time the stock has been moving up steadily with power ever since. Microcapdaily suggested in July that there were way too many good things happening here for Netlist not to keep rising.  


Netlist is easily among the most exciting stories in small caps; the big story picked up in July after the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board’s decision upholding the validity of Netlist’s U.S. 7,619,912 (‘912) patent that applies to DDR server memory modules. The decision is final and binding on future cases and represents a resounding win for Netlist. The (‘912) patent is a seminal patent; an invention so impactful that it creates or shifts the technology space. This ruling has much larger implications than just GOOG which will more than likely set the tone for other settlements long overdue here. Netlist holds a portfolio of patents including over 130 issued and pending U.S. and foreign patents, many seminal, in the areas of hybrid memory, storage class memory, rank multiplication and load reduction, among others. The Company’s sales are on a steep rise; Net sales for the third quarter ended September 26, 2020 were $10.2 million, compared to net sales of $6.1 million for the quarter ended September 28, 2019.""

Here is the reality of decriminalization...  It has nothing to do with law enforcement, it's about banking.  

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, all cannabis business is cash or hard money lenders...  Once the MORE Act passes, the cannabis industry gets access to the world credit system.  They get to be like normal businesses and apply for SBA loans etc etc.  They can  get leases without extreme deposits, insurance, regular business banking services. Decriminalizing means access to the worlds financial networks; to date large institutions couldn't touch them because of the federal criminal statute... that'll be gone with the MORE Act. Then GS, BAC, all the big money regulated funds will be able to invest...  That's alot of sideline money that has been waiting to get into a currently all cash market...

&amp;#x200B;

That's a great meal, but what about the sides... on the side?  Well... How about taxes...?  The government just gave away 6 trillion, and shut down all the businesses that PAY for that 6 trillion.  Dems are in charge... they love dope and taxes.

6,2021-03-08,"March 8 (Reuters) - The Dow climbed on Monday, led by stocks poised to benefit the most from an economic rebound as the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill awaited a final Congressional vote this week, and heavyweight tech-related stocks swung between gains and losses.

After the legislation won U.S. Senate approval on Saturday, President Joe Biden said he hoped for a quick passage of the revised coronavirus relief package by the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives so he could sign it and send $1,400 direct payments to Americans.

Prospects of more government spending and faster economic growth have stoked fears of a spike in inflation, sending the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield to near one-year highs.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, however, said on Monday the package would fuel a ""very strong"" U.S. recovery and she did not expect the economy to run too hot because of the increased spending.

The Dow hit a new record intraday high and was trading above its Feb. 24 record close. In the S&amp;P 500, the financial sector was the biggest boost, hitting a record as higher interest rates and a steeper yield curve helped banks. Industrials were right behind, also reaching a record high, while the materials sector neared an all-time peak. The technology sector was deepest in the red.

""This is an ideal traders' market with certain sectors and individual stocks performing better than the wider market, as investors pick and choose individual stocks that will perform better as the economy reopens,"" said Anthony Denier, chief executive officer of trading platform Webull.

A slide in the big tech stocks that have driven the rally in equities since pandemic-induced lows of last March continued, with Apple Inc(AAPL), Nvidia Corp(NVDA), Tesla Inc(TSLA) and Alphabet Inc's(GOOG) Google leading declining shares on Nasdaq.

Tech stocks are particularly sensitive to rising yields because their value rests heavily on earnings in the future, which are discounted more deeply when bond returns go up.

The divergence between the tech stocks and non-tech stocks explains trading today, said Joe Saluzzi, partner and co-founder of Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.

""The stimulus package will be certainly helping the bigger cap names,"" Saluzzi said, referring to non-tech stocks. ""The get-out and non-stay at home stocks are doing better now,"" he said.

By 3:09 p.m. ET (2009 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 416.64 points, or 1.32%, to 31,912.94, the S&amp;P 500 lost 3.83 points, or 0.10%, to 3,838.11 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 259.71 points, or 2.01%, to 12,660.44.

Banks added about 1.7% as the yield on the benchmark 10-year note stood near a 13-month high, while airlines jumped about 5%.

Walt Disney Co (DIS) jumped about 5.8% as California health officials set new rules that would allow Disneyland and other theme parks, stadiums and outdoor entertainment venues to reopen as early as April 1.

GameStop Corp (GME) surged about 33% after the company said it had tapped shareholder Ryan Cohen to lead a transition to an e-commerce business.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.68-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.28-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&amp;P 500 posted 124 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 390 new highs and 21 new lows.

That's a big WHAT IF for the morons playing Intel and selling AMD, I see no up side potential on the Intel side while AMD is down 20% from highs.  


So imma blow your mind ... what if AMD keeps their foot on the pedal and Intel never catches up? To me that's just as likely except prices are right for buying AMD right now. AMD makes up \~3% of the datacenter market, with their Zen 3 datacenter CPU coming out next week and TSMC investing 30 billion in production and building a fab in the US, it's still Intel's market share to lose and AMD's to win. Michael Cohen rated AMD as his #2 stock pick behind GOOG. It's a #1 BUY on Cramer's Action Alerts Club. Average price target is $103, high is $161. Stock is way below that.

24,2021-04-05,"**TL;DR:** TSLA short interest is not 5% as reported, but 26% due to float contraction &amp; options bets, making the stock susceptible to a short squeeze.

DD:

----

- The 5.5% TSLA equity short interest of 44m shares [1] is only part of the ""true"", effective TSLA short interest: there's 2.6 million put option contracts open right now [2], a significant part of which are in the money, which, on a ~20% rally due to record Q1 results, combined with 2.6 million open calls, have the delta hedging effect equivalent to another ~100m shares short covered ...
- The pro-forma float of TSLA is 771m shares [2] - but at least ~130m of that is locked up by S&amp;P 500 index funds, ~90m by options market makers for current delta hedging requirements: 220m shares or 28% of the float is already locked up today - effective float is 551m shares or lower.
- Due to TSLA's +1,000% rally in 2020 options market makers are net long TSLA by tens of millions of shares - so the delta hedging effect of put contracts doesn't show up in the regular short interest as it normally does for other names. Much of the effective short interest is ""hidden"" by this temporary artifact.
- So if we plug these numbers in: with TSLA starting at $661 if we have a major rally due to the Q1 results (TSLA already up +7% today) then we have 44m shares equity short and market makers lock up another ~100m shares during the rally just to delta-hedge the millions of puts and millions of calls.
- The delta hedging by market makers is anti-dilutive, just like short covering: it removes shares from the effective float. Anti-dilutive buy-to-cover is much stronger buying pressure than the typical trader-to-trader buying, because it contracts the float. 
- So should most Tesla shorts want to cover (not all: some are price insensitive hedges), they have to compete with the delta hedging of market makers (and regular bullish buyers): there's a combined buying of 144m shares on a 20% move, against an effective float of 551m shares. **That's an effective short interest of 26%.**
- A short interest of 26% for a low-float megacap like TSLA is excessively high compared to other megacaps: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT and GOOG short interest is all below 1%, and their options open interests are an order of magnitude smaller than that of TSLA. [4]  [5]


I.e. the Tesla shorting that drive the price down from the $900 ATH to the current $661 is an ***excessively*** overcrowded short trade, with over $30b value at risk - which they'd want to cover much faster than any GME short position.

So a significant TSLA ""synthetic short squeeze"" is possible IMO, driven in part by excessive short options bets.

Should after the record quarter TSLA rally beyond $900 price levels to new ATHs, then all bets are off.

AWS has Route53 and Cloudfront and have been taking lots of marketshare from cloudflare of late.  I can anecdotally confirm from my tech peers.  Also many large companies prefer one vendor and AWS is also cheaper to boot.

As you know Managers/Execs aren't often tech-savvy and many wouldn't even understand the benefits of Fastly and simply go with AWS.

0,2021-05-08,"It feels a lot like Feb 2000, when the dot com bubble was about to burst. I was in the thick of it... I was running a startup hoping to IPO, and I had dozens of friends who were paper millionaires with their stock options, and most wound up worthless. I started with $5k in 1998, and by 2000, I had over $200k in my Schwab account. I thought I had cracked the code, and I was feeling pretty invincible.

In Feb 2000, I shorted some tech stocks, then bailed when they kept going up and took my losses. As the bubble started to burst, I put all my money in ""safe"" profitable tech stocks (Cisco, Oracle, Network Solutions and Intel). A month later the bottom fell out. It was a roller coaster ride, with enough ups to make you think it was coming back. My ""safe"" stocks lost a bundle. I rode two companies into the ground, and lost 90% on others. 

Today, Cisco and Oracle are worth less than they were 21 years ago. Despite consistent earnings increases, they never grew into those valuations. (Yes, I wish I had put everything in AAPL, GOOG and AMZN instead).This market feels ""frothy"" (to quote someone smarter than I am).

It’s hard to know which funds have which companies in their group but if you look at how some move together you can make a good guess.

If you are trying to gamble your positions are awful because you're basically playing roulette and betting on green when the payout is 0.2 to 1 if it hits. If you literally pick all WSB stock picks you are actually a retard chasing after the train after it's already left the station, or going to your local palm reader for financial advise.

My suggestion, throw a decent portion of your portfolio (25%-50%) at FAANG (FB, AAPL, AMZN, NFLX, GOOG) or similar stable high growth stocks in long-term (5 to 35 year holdings) long positions and you can play with the rest IF you are legit trying to invest. If you're trying to gamble use options so at least you can feel like you're in Vegas and lose just as much money twice as fast, my suggestion is starting with ITM call spreads for bullish and ITM put spreads for bearish until you get a feel for market trends, press releases, earnings reports, etc. I would almost always suggest to NEVER do OTM weeklies unless you know damn well what you're doing since that is normally just throwing money at the wind. But if you want to be a true WSB autist this is the way, everyone goes through that phase and some of us never leave and just eat -100% every friday.

People don't see the full idea behind Michael Burry's TSLA short. Every single article is about how he tweeted at papa Musk and how he thinks that the company is the worst thing since he dropped his glass eye into his cat's litter box.

He doesn't think that Tesla will implode. He doesn't think it's a failing company. He just sees the reality, which is that all of their profits/revenues are way in the future.

Let's just say you win a time-delayed lottery and get $1,000,000 in 15 years. Not bad! Now let's say you won the same lottery in Venezuela in 2005. It's not even worth cashing the ticket.

It's the same deal with companies. Growth companies, however promising, have most of their expected profits in the future. Those profits have to be discounted by the **interest rate** to be turned into todays dollars. In other words, it doesn't matter how much money Tesla is going to make in the future if interest rates surge today. Well... it does matter... it's just worth a lot less.

So how does this relate to the Burry bet? You just have to scroll down a few lines on his 13F filing.

Burry has almost as many GOOG/FB calls as he does TSLA puts. Around \~$330MM of them. Why does this matter? These are big tech companies that are actually printing out metric shit-tons of profit today.

Interest rates stay the same but big tech goes up? Break even. Big tech goes down? Break even. Interest rates rise? Burry makes more money in a year than all of your wives boyfriends combined.

I understand your bull/bear analysis.

The bull case is the chip shortage.

3,2021-10-04,"Just feels like we need to see a much bigger pullback for things to seem like they're priced reasonably, but who knows whether that will happen.

Our last major pullback was of course 12 months ago... at SPY 355-360.

We just topped around SPY 450-455 a month ago.  Just an unreal 25+% run over the past 12 months.

I'd feel really good about buying if we dip into the sub-400 range, but it'll probably require us to see an actual debt default in 2-3 weeks to reach that level (who knows whether that will happen, those types of ""debt ceiling"" events have always been overhyped, but maybe not this time).

More importantly than that, a lot of high growth stocks have been consolidating all year and if that happens to big tech for an extended period of time, we could see a bigger 6-12 month sideways range (like we saw from mid-2015 to mid-2016 during that taper tantrum/interest rate hike/debt ceiling episode where S&amp;P 500 didn't have a new high for almost a year).  Probably worth at least considering how we should trade if that comes to pass.

How would you trade if MSFT/AAPL/GOOG/FB/AMZN are basically range bound for 12 months and then maybe only banks and some re-opening plays and smaller value caps are moving up.

It's worth at least planning for a ""sideways"" year like that as markets absorb tapering + interest rate hike expectations to come.  Going back and looking at stocks in 2015-2016 and how they traded is a worthwhile idea.",zg44,wallstreetbets,3.0

Google stopping ad cookies for others increases value of their user base. Apple making ad tracking harder on iOS does the same. If you have solid user network you’re good. If you don’t you’re worse off. Fb does but kind of suffers both. Does hurt from appl and goog moves but doesn’t hurt as bad because they have their own internal data sets.

6,2021-11-03,"There's way more possibilities than what you are describing.  Personally I see a very common pattern with growth companies:

* Hype, global domination, etc. dream phase.  Some never even make it past this.  It's incredibly speculative and volative.
* Those that survive enter the ""actually making money"" and ""promise might be real"" stage.  There's typically a ""validation"" of bulls here and a huge rally.  IMO TSLA is here.  However, the future becomes more clear which can be good and bad.
* Final stage is mature and either monopolistic or semi-monopolistic company like AAPL, GOOG with an extraordinary strong barriers to entry, extreme margins WITH growth.  That's the dream destination.

IMO TSLA is not GOOG.  100 years of history in the auto industry doesn't change when you swap out a ICE for a battery.  It's basically impossible to establish a sustainable moat and capture insane margins for any prolonged period.",mediumrarestonks,wallstreetbets,6.0

0,2021-12-10,"Only thing that would make me nervous if you're bullish right now is that the S&amp;P 500 had to use up an entire breakout cycle run from AAPL and hardware/semi tech just to hold up back to 470 and overcome P/E and P/S compression.

So we really need a blowoff type move on those names or rotation to some stressed names to drive the next move.  Of course we just saw GOOG and MSFT go straight up for a year so it is possible for AAPL to melt up to 200.

It's just worth thinking about those types of things when you consider how bullish or bearish you are.

If you look at AAPL's run the past month, AAPL only really has had a much bigger run one time and that was right after the pandemic started during the massive tech melt up in the middle of 2020.

You'd be surprised, but actually the number of users between DBX and MSFT/GOOG/AAPL doesn't differ that much. Dropbox has 700mln+, Google Drive reached 1bln last Nov so it's probably around 1.1bln now and I couldn't find user stats for MSFT. iCloud is obviously targeting Apple users. I think they had 620mln users in 2020 (Source: [https://www.businessofapps.com/data/apple-statistics/](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/apple-statistics/)) although this says they had 850 mln in 2018 so I'm not sure about the correct latest number (Source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/11/apple-could-sell-icloud-for-the-enterprise-barclays-says.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/11/apple-could-sell-icloud-for-the-enterprise-barclays-says.html)). BOX only has 77mln so they're the little fish in the big pond. My point is that Dropbox actually has a comparable number of users to the likes of Google, Microsoft and Apple. Box is lagging behind massively especially given the fact they've been around since 2005, even before Dropbox which was founded in 2007.

Google and Microsoft seem to target businesses more, whereas DBX is focused on individuals, small businesses, creators, self-employed people, etc. It's a different target market and that's pretty much it. The cloud storage market size is big enough for all of these. It's easy to dismiss DBX, but looking at the details draws a different picture.

I think this next week will likely be the ""beginning of the end"" of that kind of move as the Fed tips its hand on rate hikes next year (dot plot) and moves to bring tapering to a fast end.  That's the final ""shock"" that the market needs to absorb.

AAPL is in a similar situation to where TSLA was at the end of October, when TSLA was passing $1000 in the final part of its blowoff move to $1200.

I would not be loading puts on AAPL until we see volume slow and and there isn't the massive firehose of money flying into the stock for safety.
