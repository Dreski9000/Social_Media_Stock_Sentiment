0,2019-02-07,"I think it'll be corporate debt that's the catalyst to this short term bubble.  For instance Netflix has a higher market cap off ""growth"" than fucking Disney...that's truly autistic.  

Netflix would have to churn out quality content, daily, for 20 years to reach the income level of the Disney vault + StarWars + ESPN + Hulu.  NFLX would then have to get into the hospitality business.  It's impossible, especially when NFLX's board has pissed off every competitor so badly they're all in the streaming business (NBC, DIS, HBO, AMZN, FOX, FX, AMC, etc).  Now Disney is talking up ""bundles""...so time is a flat circle we're all back to cable prices essentially.

Tesla is even worse.  As are 90% of growth tech companies.  When the market shakes only profit stops the sell off &amp; tech has little to justify market caps outside the big 3.  We're literally in a dot com bubble rebirth except it's repackaged as ""apps"".

The big thing analysts will be interested in during the call is the long term prospects of A-List. It isis dilutive margin wise over 2.45 times a month; Q1 came down a bit from last year to 2.6 visits per month.

The thing analysts want to see is if theses visits per month can get below this 2.45 level in the long run (if it does, it is an accretive revenue source and will also help smooth out rough periods for the broader box office); but, on the other hand, if these 750k A-list members went and saw Avengers 3 times (this is in Q2, however), they're gonna have a bit of margin compression. 

Essentially, AMC is receiving a fixed revenue stream and paying out a variable 50% margin cost to studios (based on actual ticket prices); they have the benefit of having a 83% margin concession product (\~$4.6 per attendee), but the A-list product is so new that we need to see some more data before the unit economics make more sense.",joeyrb,wallstreetbets,14.0

It's possible that small businesses using Shopify are stronger or smarter on average, but regardless, I think their revenue base is the most at risk of facing a crunch.

2) Bed, Bath, and Beyond and other retail like it (Gamestop, Office Depot) are also probably going to finally get killed in the next recession unless they go full on zombie-mode like Sears.

3) AMC and other movie theater chains (iPic, Imax, Cinemark, Cineworld) are probably also going to face significant upheaval because I don't see how they finance their massive debt loads with their declining business models, the first thing families will cut in a recession is those bloated $20+ subscriptions they're selling.",zg44,wallstreetbets,3.0
