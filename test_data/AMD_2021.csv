5,2021-01-01,"Lol I'm guess I'm one of the few people who was -90% this year (20k -&gt; 30k -&gt; 2.5k). Fortunately this is all play money on the side, so I'm not too pissed about losing this much. I am also new to trading, and I decided that, hell I'm a smart person, let me jump into options.... Never was I so wrong on so many things in one time period in my life. (E.g. getting into Apple calls September, BBY calls November, Apple puts December literally days before they announce an Apple car that's as realistic as NKLA). Literally the only wins I had this year were in March, when I knew the market was going to tank, and NKLA puts, seeing that their tech made 0 sense. Every other trade I made, even AMD calls turned out to be a loss.

My new strategy is to only get contracts with +35dte and purchase primarily spreads (Vertical or diagonal) to mitigate risk. Here's to making making my money back in 2021.

TL;DR I thought I was smart. Turns out, I am retarded -90%",gumbyismyidol,wallstreetbets,5.0

33,2021-01-02,"I didn't say we're never going to experience a cool off. I said it is highly unlikely we go back to ""normal levels"", by which I've assumed you are talking about 2016-2017 levels with Tesla at 180 and AMD at $9.

  


Because to go back to that ""normal"", you would need a 40% drop in sp500, which is on par with the Great Financial crisis.

  


To put that in perspective, think about how unprecedentedly awful the covid crash was - and ultimately it was ""only"" 30%. And covid was by all circumstances a 1 in 100 year black swan event, multiplied by China trade tensions and American election uncertainty. All that and it was -30% only. 

  


To hit GFC levels of a crash, you would also need the fed to never re-consider more QE. You would need millions of investors to suddenly not want to invest. You would need all banking regulations specifically put in place since the GFC to prevent another financial meltdown, to fail. In other words, you would need a WW3 global event. And that is already what covid actually is (literally a **global pandemic**). 

  


Point is: what is the chance of this ""cooling off"" being anymore than a regular -10% correction? If so, why wouldn't you just stay invested in solid stocks (FAGMAN for example) anyway and you're probably going to be up way more than 10% in the coming 1-2 years?

  


&gt;Even most people in the industry say prices are overvalued.

  


Most people in the (finance) industry are fucking clueless as anyone else. They were shitting on both Tesla and AMD during those years and pushing fossil fuel boomer stocks as ""dividend aristocrats"". I would sooner bet on WSB meme stocks than on Wall Street analysts who only know how to run DCF models based on recurring cash flows. They all have no actual industry or business knowledge and have been proven wrong again and again.

  


Finally, let's be real. When some other black swan/disaster event happens in 2021 onwards, if you weren't the type to jump in march 2020, you're not gonna jump in on the next bloodbath because you'll probably come up with a reason why the sky will fall further.

  


Btw I'm not being rude/personal, just seeing the same wordings from many friends who have been giving 1001 reasons why there's ""going to be a market retracement"". 5/10/15 years later, they haven't done a single investment because there is ALWAYS something to fear on the horizon.

47,2021-01-03,Yes I know they have issues but the stock was at a point where I feel it couldn‚Äôt go lower. That‚Äôs the only reason I bought not because they‚Äôre better then AMD and figured out their shit but just because it‚Äôs the right time.,micmck,wallstreetbets,47.0

Supply constraints introduce secondary and tertiary headwinds in addition the the primary issue of just not being able to meet demand.

Still, a bit of a gold plated problem. I expect both AMD and NVDA to take off again post-CES. Right behind MU and TSMC, which are already beginning to pop off.

7,2021-01-05,"It's true that Intel hasn't spent much on desktop x86 R&amp;D since Sandy Bridge and it's now finally biting them in the ass, almost a decade later. However...

* Microsoft tried ARM; remember surface RT? It was an absolute failure. I doubt Windows is going to try to utilize ARM CPU's again any time soon.

* Demand for x86 CPU's in general is dropping because people are keeping their PCs for longer now than ever. Any CPU made in the last 10 years is powerful enough for most people (Web browsing, microsoft word, porn)

* Intel will likely beat AMD to DDR5, at least in the consumer space, and their big.little arch might work out.

* While I think the demand for gaming CPU's is growing thanks to the limited availability of next gen consoles and people getting sick of how consoles are structured in general, it's a tough road ahead because Intel can still compete quite well in that space

* They're also diversified a lot more than AMD. Even if they lose the x86 desktop segment they'll still survive.

AMD and NVDA have been competitors for years. And [Nvidia is the one leading the charge in terms of Ray Tracing](https://www.tomshardware.com/features/amd-vs-nvidia-gpus) - which most will agree is the future. 

Also, [for the past 15 years Apple has exclusively used Intel CPUs in their notebooks and desktops](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/10/why-apple-is-breaking-a-15-year-partnership-with-intel-on-its-macs-.html). Which is a relatively small blow to Intel's overall sales, but it impacts AMD even less. Now if Apple were to start making CPUs for retail consumers as a standalone product, then AMD might be in some trouble. But that seems extremely unlikely as one of the main reasons Apple wants to make their own SoCs is so that they can move away from x86 to ARM architecture. 

Nvidia has said they plan to purchase Arm from Softbank for $40 billion. The beauty of this acquisition for Nvidia is that Arm licenses out their CPU architecture to companies like Apple, Qualcomm, and Samsung.

TL DR; Nvidia will be here for a while.",Geoffs_Review_Corner,wallstreetbets,62.0

46,2021-01-10,"Delta is how much the option's premium may change if the underlying price changes 1 dollar. So let's say you purchase 1 call option of AMD for $1,000 and it has a delta of 0.50. For every point that AMD's stock price changes, the premium or worth of your call option will change by $50. So if AMD's stock goes up 10 points, your call option will now be worth $1,500. 

Delta can also be viewed as the probability that your option will expire in the money. So a delta of 0.50 would be a 50% chance. 

Theta is essentially an estimate of how much value your options contract will lose each day. Basically the price you pay each day just for owning that contract. So if your option has a theta of -0.05, it's estimated that you'll lose $5 each day just for owning that contract. 

I'm sure these are far from perfect definitions, but they should give you the gist.

People are saying the stock is overdue for a move, today was good evidence to support that, but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôll move much. MS, AMZN both were well due, and they both beat earnings, and they both tanked last earnings after staying level for months.

Horizontal spread is same strike, different expirations. In my case, 2/12 and 2/19 540C.

A vertical spread is same expiration, different strike (i.e TSLA 2/5 800C/850C). 

Motivations are all the same, get lambo rich. If you think TSLA is going 800+ but not 850+ you can sell an 850C to lower your cost basis (I.E it's $5 for the 800C,$4 for the 850C, net result being you pay $5 for the call, sell the other for $4, pay $1 net.).

Anything beyond ""Calls are up Puts are down"" is above the average user's pay grade, but there's lots of value in using complex options strategies.

73,2021-02-02,"Idealism will get you all killed. The squeeze‚Äôs peak was when it hit $500. That killed the Melvin. Good shit. The short interest prior to S3‚Äôs revised ~30% when they said it was 80+ was when NEW funds jumped in at shorted at 400-500. Now those funds have closed out which is why the new short figures are around 30%. 


They‚Äôve already profited from the peak to the $200 levels - a 50%+ gain at probably near 60 million shares (&gt;12B made)


That 30% that‚Äôs now left short are their yolos. Could a squeeze happen? Yes, but there‚Äôs a huge thing you retards are all forgetting.


These shorts are initiated at $400. There is no mechanism for retail to push the price back up to $400 without shorts covering - and they have no fucking need to cover. The daily interest is laughable when they made over 10b in their recent short. So the only way you get an actual squeeze is if retail BUYS up to 400 again WITHOUT a squeeze. Diamond handing will do literally nothing. Holding out will get you nowhere except bagsville. You fuckers need to buy, and without any squeeze momentum, retail doesn‚Äôt have the stomach for volume buying. 


All their shady shit was indeed shady shit, but it‚Äôs worked. The risk to HFs right now is extremely limited. You‚Äôre all going to get fucked, but at least we‚Äôll have the old wsb back. 


Y‚Äôall are probably gonna kill DFV when he learns that his diamond handing has caused a rope shortage in wsb.

This isn't a biotech company announcing drug results, it's an established name in gaming/tech and is unlikely to blow people's minds.

If you are wondering if the markets are being manipulated against the retail investor of GameStop. I'll offer this. Below are two links, one for GameStop, and one for AMD. They represent the latest trade prices of their shares on the NASDAQ. With all the hype around GameStop you would expect some day traders to get in on the action and maybe cause some odd numbers. Take a look at the last ten pages of each stock. If you find it odd that most of the trading happeing with GameStop is divisible by 10 you are not alone. Hedge Funds are trading stock to artificially bring the price of GameStop down. in an attempt to cover some losses. Any thoughts on this situation? Arguments?

That being said, I was in a similar spot several years back with AMD, where their stock was sitting at $5/share and now its over $80 a share because of the success they've had with their Zen microarchitecture.

292,2021-02-01,"I'm so tired of people's posts getting downvoted to oblivion on this sub for asking a reasonable question. IMO, this is a reasonable take, and of course it gets downvoted. If you look at any other stock, MSFT, APPL, AMD, TSLA, AMC, etc., you will see the same pattern of 5 or so trades at 100 shares at a time. So, are they all being manipulated with a short ladder attack, too?

My personal opinion is that people frequently trade 100 shares because it is a nice, round number, and depending on the stock, 100 shares is usually within the reach of most retail investors. I seriously doubt this is proof of a short ladder attack. 

Regardless of anyone's position on GME's outlook, it is still worth hearing out the other side of the argument and making an informed decision, weighing the risk and trading according to your tolerance. I don't get why there isn't room for discussion.

Full disclosure, I own shares of GME and I am by no means a financial expert, nor am I giving financial advice. Don't just blindly follow the advice of random internet strangers.

119,2021-02-02,"Thanks. That is some bad DD.

It's true that AMD has a full ARM license (they can develop CPUs with any ARM IP they want), and has been in development of an ARM CPU for a while now. But I think the fact that they haven't switched to ARM yet says a lot about the architecture and the current state of the market. Other companies have more of an incentive to push ARM because that's all they can develop on (since x86 is closed and unable to be licensed/used outside of about 4 companies). 

That said, AMD can develop on it whenever they please, and I'm sure if they did it'd be just as killer as any other ARM device, maybe even more so. AMD is also doing research in the direction of ISA-agnostic computing by putting FPGA-like cores inside their CPUs. 

But development doesn't = a product. And straight-out saying AMD is coming out with and ARM product in January goes against everything in their current roadmap. It would've been a nice surprise, but the likelihood of that was definitely a lot smaller than that DD would lead you to believe.",marakeshmode,wallstreetbets,119.0

Intel shareholders were desperate to find a silver lining in the stock, and Pat G was that silver lining.

The silver crash today showed strong sell OBV... For instance, AMD when it tanked last week showed weak OBV selling and now its recovering.... I do believe, GME will recover because the OBV is very weak. I think historically during major sell offs with low OBV, it suggests a potential recovery, as mainly only a small amount of volume has tanked the price, and the price can easily go back up.

Hey mate, sorry doe hijacking your post. I'm a complete n00b at this and have been using Revolut to just play with stocks the last couple months. Jumped on GME late and have &lt;1 stock - but feck it sure I'm holding!

Problem is two fold; first off I'm on my phone which is half broken as a windows update absolutely bricked my computer yesterday. Still working on fixing it but my google-fu is a bit limited as a result.

Main reason I'm posting; Revolut just sent an email saying they can't allow people to buy GME or AMD anymore. I can sell, but I can't buy.

Obviously can't just google ""Where to buy stock"" because it's going to recommend arsemaggots like Robinhood. What service would you recommend I use?

Also since it apparently was a liquidity problem why after raising 3.4 billion at this point would be their excuse to not open up buy option on stocks fully? 

I don't see how robinhood survives this. I know I'm pulling out when this is said and done and I'm pretty sure millions of others will.

I grew up with a high level broker for a father who had me reading stocks as I learned to read. He was very conservative and didn‚Äôt like to risk other people‚Äôs money. So I‚Äôve been playing the market the same way.

378,2021-02-02,"I'm going to level with everyone here. I'm not an investor. I took $120 two years ago, bought $AMD stock because I liked the stock and had a hunch their 3rd gen Ryzen, Epyc, and Radeon GPU's would help them continue to steal Intel/Nvidia market share.

I was right and that $120 turned into $386 after 18 months. That stock has been pretty stagnant compared to the gains I was getting (I'm now reading $AMD might be getting shorted which is the reason it's growth has halted, but don't get distracted, $GME is all we like right now), but I was still ahead. I heard about the $GME hype from my brother-in-law who, sadly, bought at about $30/share and sold when it hit $90. A great return, but man if he could have held. He's back in now, but at a much higher cost.

I don't go to the casino that often, but when I do, about $100 is the most I'm willing to lose, and I do *play to lose*. Gambling is entertainment, not a business (unless you own the house). My husband and I make comfortable money for the area we live in. If I can make that $100 last me 1 or 2 hours, I consider that a major win, and the loss just means a little less goes into savings that month, or maybe I don't buy the special edition game and just get the base edition.

So, despite *wanting* to make bank, if $GME does keep dropping and the short squeeze really is over like the news outlets want us to believe (it's not), well, that's $120 of gambling money I made last two years. That's a win in my book. The fact that there is this giant community that will experience the same thing as me just makes the whole effort worth it in my book.

TL;DR, if I can make a huge profit, I'm going to sell. If I lose it all, which I understand is far, far less then what many people have in (1 share at $350.11), I'll consider the two years of gambling with the same $120 totally worth it.

For anyone curious, my current investment, which once peaked at a 222.17% increase over 18 months, has dropped to a 14.94% increase over the same time period since cashing out $AMD and buying $GME. But I'm having fun and the ticket price is well worth the ride.",gucknbuck,wallstreetbets,378.0

For some retard reason  I didn't sell because I had few positions on \~80/120 and few on \~300 and figured out... Well...Drop to 200 won't kill me so... It's like 150% of current price. No way. And then the drop to 118 occured ;p So... After this I was like... Okey. I don't know what's going on, I don't understand why it's going on, the trade is banned, politics are all over it, I'm out. For me, this was not about stock anymore. I guess I  was grabbed by the hype, which caused me to miscalculate what is actually going on. It was fun tho... Lot of money and wild ride. Just not enough self-awareness on selling-point (and standing by it).  


As for investments, I'm not very experienced trader, but... Here are my thoughts long-term investments:   


1)  NOKIA (I think in \~5 years 5G tech can help them pivot a little bit, besides... 20B cap market and \~5$ shares seems extremely undervalued) .  


2) AMD - I think it will go up and their tech is solid, although... Apple and new M1 chips (Apple Silicon) makes me doubt, about if Apple will use AMD in the future and if not - that might be a nice dip possibility to buy in.

3) Rolls-Royce, which is like 0.9$ a share now. It's really low and I figured... They are making Jet Engines right? Wouldn't they prosper a little better in next 3-5 years? But more research is needed in this one for me.  I'm Software Engineer so... Nokia and AMD is something, that I understand and see potential. As for this - I'm not really sure. More of a guess.  


Overall, I still don't know what is my view point on stock market in 2021.  After crazy 2020, I thought that some slight correction of 10-15% on the whole market is possible, so... I try to be very cautious with investments now (don't count GME :D).  If it will happen... Then I'm all in :P But will it? I don't know.",Barmin93,wallstreetbets,462.0

FORGET HOLD; instead, BUY THE DIP. Here's why:

GameStop just went through a massive undershoot and it's about to cycle back up or at least reach equilibrium with higher potential growth. 

Back in October, Microsoft announced a partnership with GameStop (this is important because of the XBOX market as prices for consoles start to return to normal with increased production of both the units and competitive GPUs by AMD and NVIDIA. 

Then there's GME's new executive appointments with a Chief Officer from Amazon AWS; this is in addition to their campaign for an E-Commerce transformation. 

And now onto technicals of the stock, Robinhood's class action lawsuits are coming together, short position volume is dying out, and we just saw the first green moves after that corrupt scam by Wall Street. 

Talking about indicators, RSI is low as hell, Schaff is on the verge of breaking 25, Ichimoku and short and long SMAs and EMAs are catching up, and MACD is converging for a cross at its bottom out level, so the room for growth is incredible and the push is around the corner. 

All it needs is one burst of buy orders in the next couple days without Wall Street's short volume and the 8.4 million degenerates WSB can be in control again. This is without even mentioning social media influence now that everyone's eyes are on the stock.

The owners would be making a large profit while minimizing the loss of the borrowers and presenting a united Wall St front against us peasants. There very well may be a reason this cannot happen, but I'm an ignorant ape. Please, someone explain.

\---------------  


PLTR 

Bull, Earnings coming up 11/2, and for the first time I think they will have reached earnings. Years before they never reached because they were focusing on infrastructure and growth. Now it's soon time to make a profit, and over the course of years they will most likely increase steadily. They've built up a good foundation.

&amp;#x200B;

Mom Cathie believes in it and has loaded up a lot for ARK, and she is one of the best investors alive atm.  


Bear, Lock-up period finished soon + Citi marking it as a $15 stock. Bear short-term, but 100% Bull long term

PLTR 50-60 EoY

\----------------------

&amp;#x200B;

FTCH,   


Luxury retailer that is sort of a portal for different luxury shops to add their store so you can browse them all at the same time. It's not a single store like Matchesfashion or SSense so in that sense they are pretty alone in the market. No real competitiors.  


Bull: Steadily climbing, almost monopoly. People have realized you can order luxury online now instead of going to stores because of Covid.

&amp;#x200B;

Bear: Idk might have grown in market cap a bit too quick, might adjust a bit short term but will be good long term.

I think some of the institutions holding AMD and TSLA had to sell them off last week to cover their GME short positions. And that‚Äôs why they both went down during all the mania. Now TSLA is recovering off of almost no new news, and AMD was due to keep rising after a pretty decent quarter. Price targets lifted and promising guidance for the year.

By making it chiplet you reduce the chance of having a defect.

115,2021-02-08,"Super yes on server cpu's. Takes time for amd to cycle into that market cause it's industrial scale and changing chipsets isnt an easy task but if amd maintains dominance it will happen since correct there is very little reason to stay on intel unless you already have a bunch of intel mobos and stuff.

As for gpu I am really cautious about saying amd will dominate that one. The 6800 and 6900 are both powerful but it would be tough for me to recommend a 6800 over a 3080 (assuming msrp). Looking ahead rdna3 should be awesome and hopefully amd is able to shore up it's ray tracing and dlss shortfalls.

End of the day amd beat intel b/c they found a better piece of tech (chiplet design) which allowed them to best intel, mixed with intel failing to get off 14nm design. On the gpu front amd doesn't have any new tech to destroy nvidia and while nvidia's ceo is cocky his business isn't stuck on 14nm++++++++++++++++++ redesigns.

&amp;#x200B;

\[It came onto the radar of a lot of people for their association with Google, and specifically with Google Glass (Himax provided the LCoS display). \]

&amp;#x200B;

When it came onto my radar, it intrigued me due to an article written by Mark Gomes.  He mentioned about 1500 patents.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a self-described Autist who likes to read patent info.

&amp;#x200B;

So, back then - I did:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\[I still continue to read patent stuff.\]

&amp;#x200B;

The thing that got me about Himax was not only its patent portfolio, but its debt - or should I say, their lack thereof.

&amp;#x200B;

It looked pretty tasty, so I pulled the trigger.  

&amp;#x200B;

I bought in around $6, several months later I could have sold for $15-16 and I didn't.  

&amp;#x200B;

I held.

&amp;#x200B;

That holding was a mistake on my part, as it has been a roller-coaster ride.  

&amp;#x200B;

That said - they are now firing on all cylinders, and the rest of the tech world is now starting to catch up to a lot of their patents and will be using them.  

&amp;#x200B;

Interestingly, I feel their LCoS technology will shine not as AR headset material, but in use for sensors - specifically as automotive LiDAR systems:

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/09/03/1909795/0/en/Lumotive-and-Himax-Technologies-Target-Autonomous-Vehicles-with-Industry-First-Liquid-Crystal-on-Silicon-Solution-for-High-Performance-LiDAR-Systems.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/09/03/1909795/0/en/Lumotive-and-Himax-Technologies-Target-Autonomous-Vehicles-with-Industry-First-Liquid-Crystal-on-Silicon-Solution-for-High-Performance-LiDAR-Systems.html)

&amp;#x200B;

Contrary to Elon's feelings that ""LiDAR is a fool's errand,‚Äù I feel it will be one of many technologies which will be used in the automotive (and commercial trucking) industries in the coming years.  

&amp;#x200B;

Lumotive is a privately held company backed by Bill Gates, and shares of Himax will be a great way to get exposure to their offerings.

&amp;#x200B;

Extra Special Bonus - Himax's bread-and-butter for years has been creating ICs for flat panel displays.  As those panels are now going to be ubiquitous in vehicles, the demand for this tech is booming (they were planning to eventually transition away from this as their primary business; good thing they haven't, yet) and they are gonna make some serious bank on this.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR:

&amp;#x200B;

 \-  Long term, I see this doing an AMD, possibly getting anywhere from $60-100 within 3 years.  Not steady however; there will be opportunities to trade in and out of it, so if you miss this run up, don't worry - there will be others.

&amp;#x200B;

 \- I may certainly exit before earnings in May 2021.  Historically, it goes down after the conference call, even when they've had blow out numbers.  

&amp;#x200B;

If they pre-announce in March (they probably will), and the earnings are really, really good, I may sell a chunk at that juncture and then put some back in later in the year.  I've held this for 8 years (and added to it over time), and I'm wanting to explore some other stuff that's out there with some of my Himax play money.

Will AMD rise given that they are unable to sell more chips due to lack of availability from TSMC? Same would go for others in the same, Intel and Nvidia.



TSMC announcement that they will prioritize chips for cars in their earnings call last month. TSMC currently manufacturers chips for Intel, Nvidia, Apple, Sony and Microsoft, all of which have released new hardware this past few months (CPU, GPU and consoles). AMD has been unable to fulfill demand on their latest CPUs and GPUs due to shortages (COVID, TSMC, etc.) and it does not seems like that is going to change anytime soon.


From my opinion:
It seems to me that since AMD can not sell enough chips on CPU and GPUs, and given that TSMC only has so much capacity, I find it hard to believe the stock will rally higher until AMD is able to produce more chips and finally sell more chips.",helloadam,wallstreetbets,161.0

250,2021-02-08,"Some fundamentals and risks to add from someone who watches the industry:

1. AMD has, until last year, been the lower quality bargain brand of CPUs, unable to match Intel. In early 2020 they showed a product lineup that almost totally eclipsed Intel‚Äôs across the board. This is showing first in the enthusiast market (gaming) but with the right investments and time this will move into enterprise sales. Enterprise is slow to move and AMD B2B sales+marketing+support is not as established as Intel‚Äôs. They will see big wins in the coming years as they have a better product that is significantly cheaper.

2. AMD traditionally pioneers higher memory bandwidth to their CPUs, which is synergistic with accelerators and their GPUs.

3. AMD had an unexpectedly amazing showing in their consumer graphics cards compared to Nvidia. Here they were recently a bargain brand as well but couldn‚Äôt even get close to touching the performance of Nvidia products. Now for rendering they are about on-par and much less energy hungry. The competition is strong here compared to the CPU space. It is important to note that Nvidia ships even it‚Äôs graphics focused chips with AI accelerators and they still own the general purpose SIMD space, which is generally what data center and AI is consuming. In summary, AMD is outperforming here but still has work to do if they want to beat the competition on all fronts.

Now for the risks:

1. ARM: it‚Äôs been talked about as the x86 killer for nearly a decade now and many have written it off. I think Apple showing they can make it work for their laptops and continued work on Windows support is going to eat into this. Not to mention several well funded startups have been taking big steps in making arm servers accessible. There is major incentive to arm‚Äôs lower power solution, even in data centers. Nvidia squiring ARM and networking companies is a large threat.

2. RISC-V: similar to arm, but less developed and likely much further off. I don‚Äôt see this as any immediate concern.

3. Capital. They don‚Äôt have the means to invest more than their competitors to fight on two fronts. This hasn‚Äôt mattered since Intel has dropped the ball and gotten themselves into a monopolistic, enterprise mindset where they invest more in sales than in R&amp;D but if their competitors decide to put in the investment they can easily outspend AMD and we could see that take effect in 3-6 years.

TL;DR: expect market share of Intel and AMD to flip. Great R&amp;D progress on CPU and GPU. Graphics/gaming market share will increase but to an unknown extent due to heavy competition. Watch out if Intel starts putting heavier R&amp;D on its balance sheet or for major ARM advances outside of traditional mobile computing.

Intel is pretty far behind on their processors because they slept on their laurels for too long, but they could still surprise us at some point with a much better transistor once they figure it out. Also, nVidia still annihilates them on GPU power, driver support (god the AMD drivers are so fucking bad holy shit), and extra features on hardware (Tensor cores) and software (DLSS, Shadowplay, etc)...

I remember when he got modded and then started advertising some shit so he got un-modded and banned, then he made some WSB wannabe sub or whatever. _I lived through 1ronyman._  

I have an even older Reddit account than this one (this one is 5 years old) that was on WSB even before that, which I deleted.  

You can pretend that OP is just another paid shill, but I'll vouche for him that he is saying what I and MANY MANY MANY MANY MANY other OG's have been thinking for weeks.  

And I am not someone who was burnt by GME. In fact, I bought in at $40 and got out at $250, making out roughly $100k in the process.  

There's no sore feelings here. I got my tendies. The play was good. I watched it from the sidelines too long. I almost pulled the trigger at $15.50 and wish I had.

* Expect Intel to absolutely come back even stronger within the next year or two. They aren't going anywhere, and this will affect both their share price and how people invest in the competition.

* AMD was on a tear all year. Marginal rate of return is in full effect right now. This should be a good sign for anyone long AMD.

I was under the impression that Intel is crumbling and even with a turn around still making miss steps on shit they created.

So the perspective that was is that in recent years AMD was taking Intels market share, but Intel did retain some of its market share, not the ''AMD LOSES MARKET SHARE TO INTEL'' like the news wrote. Its more that Intel didn't lose entire market share we though they lost to AMD.

While everyone was busy with GME, we had 5 catalysts that would in normal circumstances increase AMD price. Historically best earnings, Intel fucking up(that does always sky rocket AMD price), AMD Tesla deal - memestock fusion.

I know there is a lot to talk about and a lot to question in future, i personally was just looking why AMD stock is so untypically stagnant. Few months ago the same line of news would just doubled its price right then and there.

They used to be solidly in the driver seat and whatever they rolled out used to be the next new benchmark.
This is and hasn't been the case for quite some time now. And the only reason AMD hasn't taken over more ""yet"" is enterprise takes time to get comfortable with new offerings just like everything else. That scale has tipped and I expect further acceleration as supply chains catch up.

AMD also has diversified themselves by the acquisition of Xiilinx which completely changes the long game and Intel is just trying to catch up in x86 space. The game hanger is hybrid x86 FPGA solutions which has the potential to allow cloud and server providers to allow a standard offering be customer tailored within a couple of hours burning in a new binary on the FPGA. You can accelerate AI processes with hardware offloading or Machine Learning.
Network pre processing or analytics for financial systems which is in some instances is 1000x faster than the fastest x86 in existence. The potential is close to limitless if they can integrate their solution in a user friendly way.

TSMC and Samsung are theit only real competitors. Companies like AMD and Apple have to rely on TSMC, and if TSMC went into some sort of geopolitical shit show, Intel would benefit greatly (Samsung would also benefit, but I'm not sure Apple would give Samsung access to their chip designs). The best example of someone trying to catch Intel, TSMC, and Samsung is SMIC, and they are easily a decade behind Intel and Samsung, and probably another three-five years behind TSMC. These are huge factors in why China has accelerated their pull on Taiwan. They want their tech, and China's been dirty tactics to get it. Apple would not have that luxury, and they wouldn't be able to blatantly rip off IP and trade secrets without consequences. The worst that happens to China when they do that is what happened to UMC/Fujian when they blatantly stole Micron's tech (e.g. wrist slap for UMC, and Fujian just gave their tech to another China-backed ""start-up"").

I'm now moving into the defence industry, LMT RTX TXT and there's a reason why In not in that industry anymore. Its because those things happen.

The industry is still growing and there is a huge audience for it. 
What should be the mindset is identifying how close a company is to core esports functions. The closer it is the more volatile it will be. If its in a more supporting role then you'll have less bumps and a safer uptick over time. 

Direct - Publishers 
ATVI - high right now but they have a lot betting on esports

Sponsors / product 
AMD , NVDA , CRSR , LOGI
Semiconductor companies will hike with rising demand for high end silicon - CRSR and LOGI both offer a wide array of products that are core to audiences. 

Platforms
HUYA , BILI , KC 
These plays are mostly based on movements in the chinese market . Huya is a 50/50 I think its undervalued currently but it could go either way with how the conversation is going. BILI benefits as it hits a lot of markets and is positioned to be the youtube of chinas market and has done considerable buy ins for broadcasting rights of HQ esports content.
KC is web services - gaming in china depends on them and many of the streaming platforms also use them so if the platforms see an uptick in use you'll see that mirrored in KC.

141,2021-02-09,"AMD does not have a fab, they are ""fabless"" meaning TSMC actually presses AMD's chips.

TSMC has the 7nm process, not AMD. That is one disadvantage of being fabless, not being able to control when your chips shrink, TSMC decides that for AMD on their own process schedule.

However, TSMC has announced the 5nm  EUV  design specifically for AMD and announced 2021 as a target so we will know more this year.

But you are probably correct and if AMD drops to 5nm in 2021 and Intel catches up to 7nm in 2022; AMD will maintain a market advantage for a few years (at least).  


Its one of the reasons Im long on AMD BUT always worried about TSMC's leverage.

But for anyone doing literally any work that benefits from multi-core performance (e.g. video editors, artists, developers, etc.), it just makes more sense to go with AMD.

And yet, it's completely wrong.  When ""DD"" meant something, it was for those that did a deep dive on the analysis part of the stock.  It was never meant to ""draw buyers in"".  It was to convince them that ""this"" stock is one you were meant to pay attention too.  The DD was always meant to be the biggest part of WSB.  Someone did a deep dive on a stock, projected their revenues, operating expenses, tried to predict how the market would react to it.  


I ignored the DD on AMD when it was at 3-5, and kept buying puts on it.  I caught a piece of it on NVDA, but instead of buying in at 20, I played the options and only got a fractions of it.

That'll happen when you run out of stock but people are still willing to buy a lesser product...

What you're ignoring is Intel's profit margins getting slaughtered because they're under pricing pressure. They're barely up on profit this year despite a large increase in revenue, and they're down two years ago and a year ago from three years ago. This year is just a lot of demand because of work from home and lock downs.

Yea, you still have some doctors that will throw whatever into a patients mouth, but  Anecdotally I've been prescribed a controlled substance for 18 years. Never once asked for an early refill, and the last time my dosage was upped AMD traded for $5 a share. My doctor is retiring, and calling around I've found a lot of doctors are against it despite my almost 2 decade long medical history detailing how other alternatives haven't worked. I've also have had pretty positive experiences on shrooms so I don't doubt that it has can be used as a potential treatment.

I really don't see this happening. AMD sold/spun off their foundry business into GlobalFoundries because they were bleeding money. AMD still uses them for the 12nm IO die for Ryzen processors, and that's because they don't need to be as complex as the Zen chiplets made by TSMC so they save money. It's just more cost effective to outsource to companies whose sole business is literally making chips.

The only companies that can pull off designing their own processors while simultaneously owning their own fabs are Intel (because they've always done it that way, but look at how they screwed themselves with their broken 10/7nm nodes), and Samsung with their mobile Exynos SoCs and memory ICs (lots of money to throw at the problem).",ilessthanthreemath,wallstreetbets,16.0

TSMC actually agreed to be a temporary fab for Intel like you said, until they recently announced they were bringing in a new CEO (their ex-CTO, an actual engineer, not just a businessman) who basically shot the deal in the head by implying they wouldn't rely on ""external foundries"" as much as they were rumored to before. TSMC somehow found extra capacity at their fabs for Intel, something that still confuses me since they're basically already operating at 100% and not taking new orders (see also: Nvidia being forced to go to Samsung for consumer Ampere GPUs).

Intel is targeting 2023 for their 7nm process to be fixed, at which point they'll probably steamroll AMD since they own their own fabs and can operate them at maximum speed.

&gt;but TSMC looks to have a market advantage for the next year or so.

59,2021-02-12,"&gt;Is there much room to grow for TSM

I think it's a good time to be selling shovels (chip fabrication) instead of mining for gold (chip designers).

The problem with TSMC right now is that they're supply-constrained because of a lack of certain materials (mainly Ajinomoto build-up film, or ""ABF""). At the same time there's intense demand from traditional high-performance compute and mobile chipmakers (AMD, Apple, Nvidia, Qualcomm, anyone-that-isn't-Intel). TSMC is literally operating at 100% capacity at all of their fabs: 5nm for Apple and Qualcomm (who missed hard on earnings due to lack of supply), 7nm for AMD's CPUs/GPUs/console APUs and Nvidia's datacenter GPUs, with 3nm coming online for Apple in 2022, and a shiny new 5nm fab scheduled to open in 2024 in Arizona.

The demand is so intense that even Nvidia with their unlimited amount of money can't get their 30-series GPUs manufactured at TSMC because there's simply no more capacity. The rumor that was floating around a while ago was that Leather Jacket Man supposedly wanted a discount for all Ampere products and TSMC said no, hence consumer GPUs having to being made on Samsung's 8nm node (where yields are very low, one of the reasons for the Great GPU Shortage of 2020-21). Nvidia recently doubled down by signing a new agreement with Samsung to increase production of dies for 30-series cards, but who knows when that'll resolve itself. It also doesn't help that AMD is allocating 80% of their capacity for consoles and 20% for their own products at TSMC on 7nm.

I dont know why governments around the world are blaming* TSMC for the automotive semiconductor shortages, when less advanced semiconductor companies (like NXPI, IFFNY, STM, etc.) are the ones to blame, along with the automakers themselves. When COVID-19 hit, automakers decided to scale back on purchasing less advanced semiconductors (we're talking larger chips for stuff like power steering, not infotainment systems) from these smaller companies because they thought they wouldn't sell any cars last year. Instead they saw increased demand to the point where even Ford shut down the plant where they build F-150s, their most profitable vehicle. Automotive semiconductors literally make up only ~3% of TSMC's sales - compare that to 48% for mobile and 33% for HPC.

Positions: heavily long on TSM, AMD, NVDA, MU, AVGO, might pick up some more QCOM if they dip further. If I could somehow invest in Samsung's fab business or just the chipmaking side of Apple instead of the entire companies, I would.

Now Intel owns all their own fabrication facilities, but their latest technology (fabrication process) is trailing behind the likes of TSMC and Samsung.  So Intel is competing with TSMC in fabrication, but has approached them to perhaps make some Intel chips while Intel sorts their shit out.  To this TSMC said ""sorry, but we got too many orders from AMD and Nvidia"" so you're on your own.

I don't know that this helps anyone make a decision, but TSMC looks to have a market advantage for the next year or so.  Especially since they're making all the AMD chips in the PS5s and Xbox Series XYZ.

They have decreased production of graphics cards, and new tariffs that were put in place last month have fucked their profits. Same thing for aftermarket cards. 

Can't find a 3060ti at MSRP, can't find a 3070 at all, 3080's are 2x-3x the price (scalpers on ebay), etc.

Plus AMD has some rumors going around that they are making GPU's that will have SIGNIFICANTLY better ray tracing than Nvidia's current GPU's. 

Hopefully the 3060 SUPER and 3070ti or whatever gpu that they want to produce next will come out soon, but it won't come out in time for earnings. I'll play for Q1 or something.

Only thing that is causing a bit of uncertainty is that the idea of everyone going ‚Äúback to normal‚Äù causing streaming numbers/video game time going to pre pandemic levels but I‚Äôm betting against that idea. I think the numbers will drop slightly, but people that bought new rigs/PCs aren‚Äôt going to just stop being consumers as soon as they can go out again, we‚Äôre gamers ffs. Plus as more and more people see how profitable streaming/gaming content can become (seeing a slight uptick in Warzone &amp; other games appearing on tiktok etc), Elgato is the best capture card out rn. Only thing that I‚Äôm actually worried about is the Esports market - no new competitive games coming out this year means no insane growth for their SCUF controller department. Plus RGB hype.

Take all this with a grain of salt - I was betting that Blizzard was gonna have bad earnings (as I had a feeling that OW2 and Diablo 4 would be postponed), and they beat because of Warzone and new WOW expansion.

287,2021-02-11,"They were long considered an underdog and a second-rate company. Intel is fucking around (why are we still making I5‚Äôs honest to god the same fucking processor for 12 years, that‚Äôs like a geologic age in computer market time) and NVIDIA hitched their wagon to Intel early on. AMD is ravaging the processor sector right now with their ryzen series. Incredibly powerful and affordable processors are changing the game and making Intel look like a dinosaur.

Problem is that NVIDIA makes killer, killer GPU‚Äôs and Radeon has always struggled to compete. In price and performance. Definitely miles away in terms of stability. There‚Äôs a reason why you can get the Radeon cards easily enough and 3000 series has been AWOL for 4 months. Stability under load is the reason. Until Radeon architecture can realistically compete with NVIDIA, they won‚Äôt close the gap in the GPU market.

Now the flip side is AMD makes processors, too, and a lot of whales and MM‚Äôs on Wall Street think Intel is still king and will get their shit together eventually. If AMD can cover that market this year as effectively as they did last couple years, we‚Äôll see major breakout on AMD share price. In my opinion.",DaFountain98,wallstreetbets,287.0

Essentially everyone in the manufacturing/retail space that needs SCs is outsourcing to TSMC because their processes are multiple generations ahead of the closest competitor, Intel in particular. As much as I love what‚Äôs happened with AMD over the last 4 years, TSMC are the real architects of their success. For anyone who isn‚Äôt plugged into this industry, all you need to know is that all it took for AMD to erase a decade of Intel‚Äôs dominance was the decision to close their foundries and let TSMC manufacturer the CPUs. That should tell you how far behind Intel really is.

Sidenote, it‚Äôs likely that the entire SC industry shifts away from x86 and transitions to ARM, in which case Intel will be even further behind the curve (AMD would also suffer in this case. For proof of this development, look no further than the Apple M1 chip and Nvidia‚Äôs attempted $40 billion acquisition (agreed upon but not yet approved).

I guess horse races aren't gambles then

&gt;crash of March 2020

That was a dip, not a crash. The Fed pumped in money to stop it from being a crash.

Look at 2001, where thousands of reputable companies went bankrupt. Companies like Microsoft took a decade to recover, long holds like GE and CISCO never recovered and it's 20 years later, Tesla is incredibly over-valued and reflects 2001 speculation. The market overall is overvalued, and nobody knows whether or not it's a bubble that's about to pop. Even valuable companies like AMD will drop with the rest of the market if this is anything like 2001. People don't even talk about 2001 that much either, they're always focused on 2008, which was pretty much an aftershock. 

Point is, you can increase your odds and make good bets, but all of it is gambling. Timing the market fails most of the time, and the people who succeed get the attention. Index funds are the safest bet because historically they've always gone up on average, and if they stop going up, that probably means we have bigger problems.

Intel may by currently lagging in this game of tech development that has many ups and downs but it is precisely because of this that you can by Intel at a discount. If you are constantly buying the currently best preforming businesses you will have a hard time beating the market in the long run. Intel's strategic positioning allows them to fix their issues without great difficulty. Even if they kept losing market share for a few years they would still be undervalued and AMD overvalued at current prices.

2) CRSR isn't a chip play.  They make rgb gear and water-cooling radiators and shit

3) and this is the big one: they had a blowout year last year because everybody and their dog built a computer last year due to the new gpu's and consumer chips from AMD.  Which means they needed corsair fans and RAM and psu's.

.... Those people aren't building another computer this year.  It's cyclical, we won't see them again for at least 3 years.  And they'll recycle their fans and power.

359,2021-02-12,"CRSR doesn't really sell anything with high end chips. Even state of the art DRAM (one of their most technically advanced product lines), is using legacy processes, 15nm and up.

The high end processes are something like TSMC's 7nm and below. There's a shortage there as well, but not so prominent, as big players which need it (Intel, AMD, NVIDIA, etc etc) have reserved capacity well in advance anyway, and these chips are expensive, so not a lot of places where they can be used, except when you need the absolute best in performance per cm2. This is basically just PC/console CPUs and GPUs, maybe some motherboard ICs and SSDs (have no idea about the manufacturing of SSDs so). 

On the other hand, PSUs, DRAM, headsets, keyboards, mouses, stream decks and all the other shit CRSR sells uses cheap legacy nodes for its ICs, because they're not really very complicated or compute-intensive chips and so it's much better if they are cheap than efficient. This is what the automotive industry needs as well, and what Biden wants to relieve. 

The shortage there is a much bigger problem, but also easier to solve, as there's a metric fuckton of fabs doing these old nodes, even in the US. A bit of capital injection to build more capacity (where it makes sense) can go a long way.

Now the risk of being bullish on CRSR just because of that is that the admin might do the absolute minimum to unblock automotive and related boomer industries, and it might still take some time until CRSR finds some capacity for their stuff even after your gov steps in.

So make of this whatever you want, I'm not a WSB regular, just have a little bit of knowledge about chip manufacturing. But this is all based on public info and I may be just talking out of my ass",ddavidovic,wallstreetbets,359.0

Hi everyone long time lurker/AMD retard here. Sorry for poor formatting I am on mobile but i really want to discuss this.

$250-250k to basically 0 now to the theory! 

I have been watching ü§ì the GME saga for weeks now and ready every single post, shitpost from WSB, GME and so on and something has really bothered me. üßê

How will üí© shitadel get out of this. So lets talk about a few theories as to what is happen and multiple fronts.

1. Front is old and new shorts, have a war according to uncle bruce between NYC hedge funds and CME options traders in which shorts are flipping long at the expense of naked sellers of the CME. To do this you buy enough ITM calls to cover your short and a little extra to sell back to naked options sellers thus getting out of the short and passing the burning house to options sellers. Now granted this may only work for small positions.

2. The second front is the large short positions that are so fucking deep it will form the black hole of the galaxy. How do they cover and still break even or profit without necessarily cheating. 

Well you heard of interstellar ü™Ä i shall put on my tin foil hat and explain black hole event horizon slingshot.

How does it work? Well it requires 3 things shorts that will exit, put/call options but mainly puts and chaos/volatility. 

The theory is that shitadel will tank the market and use the stimulus money. Now retarded spud ü•î how do they do that? Well.. 

Most people are getting a $1400 üí∞ check which they should be buying food and shit with but are buying FDs and stonks.  Fun fact if 1 million Americans yoloed GME thats 1.4 Billion $$$. Now imagine how much shitadel can get out with if half did that. 

Effectively pumping the markets. So what do you do if your short so fucking deep that your anus is wider than the sun and the sun is shining? 

You first cheat to stabilize the position aka GME and the market. Thus effectively shorting volatility and lowering IV. 

Now how does that relate to GME? Well if GME does the damage we think it will do then you need insurance. Which are basically options.

Queue magnifying glass. If you look at any boomer stock and or blue chip etc there are 10s of thousands of puts for march 19th. 

FOR EVERY FUCKING large cap. Now lets look at the chaos/volatility fuel in this case VIX and VXX derivatives. 

Considering how chaotic the market looks and the looming doom that is GME vix is really low. 
If you look at VXX in particular for march 19th there are 80000 calls at $20 and 40000 at 40.

Im no tin foil man but that seems like an elaborate setup for a rug pull and ive been through many. 

Shitadel may use that as justification for shorts and right now theyre fucked. GME turn around, they lost their mole CFO and now the SEC is turning sides with new officials. This smells the ultimate exit.

JDST, JNUG, UVXY, SVXY, AMD, BEYOND MEAT, THE piss, the coup, the shitcoins shill, montezation of WSB attempt, SPY FDs 0DTE and Trump Tweets I have been with WSB through it all and this time i want to contribute.

Tl;dr. Shitadel is planning the biggest rug pull ever and its powered by gamestop. How do you capture the violence that will occur to 401ks ane retirement? 

Gamestop, VXX, and puts on ‚Äúinsert favorite boomer stock here‚Äù or SPY.

Positions 

GME: 
Calls for 

3/5
3/12
3/19
3/26 

at various strikes at 115-800

VXX: 

Calls for
3/19 at $40 for 500 calls adding an additional 500-1000 for insurance.

Fun position
RKT

3/12 at $25 for 45 calls. 

They will be rolled into GME and additional puts across the market.

Also: 100+ shares and holding across 5 brokers https://imgur.com/a/urp4YcN

Personally, I try to only buy what I know, besides GLD, SLV (just hedging bets best I know how), SPY etc, I only buy green energy and it's done very well for me, but I've researched it thoroughly and despite Biden/Dems/Paris, the market tanking also means green energy tanks. Then again, if I'm trying to time the market, I'm no less a retard than anyone else here. And I have read great advice here, like RKT before it went up, in a sensible comment a few weeks back in a daily post like this, from a sensible person, and not bought. bc I know green energy (I like the stocks; I've researched the companies; I 'believe' in it - and when I'm ready to buy green energy again, sure I'll post my picks here) and almost everything else has done me dirty. But if I was actually smart, I would not try to time the market bc I do not have ESP and I also do not have the slightest idea who your wife's BF is.

I ofcourse swingtrade to but swingtrade with everything what you have to make money will bring you to 0.

Buy and hold is the way. I bought facebook 2 days after they entered the stock market bought for around $19 sold for $45. I bought together with a friends Tesla in 2012 he sold 2 years later for profit i still hold them. AMD was $2 in 2016 it stayed around that price it went up in no time. If you swingtrade you will miss the momentum. You sell with 10% profit wait for lower price it stays around that price you look 1 month later price is up 100% you buy price goes down you sell to buy another stock whats going up and the day when you bought it goes down -10% and stays there for months.

Better tech than Intel but cheaper than NVIDIA, no fabrication operations because they were losing money on it a few years ago so sold it off to focus on design, which I think gives them more flexibility to adapt to capitalize on any investments that could be coming from the public sector, and they probably aren‚Äôt bleeding money from production constraints like the others. Probably the best CEO in the space as well. 

I also like Qualcomm a lot for similar reasons, but also because they‚Äôre positioned to win big in 5G and will probably do well in the IoT space as well. Much more mature company too with a nice dividend ($.65/share).",notpr1m,wallstreetbets,24.0

119,2021-03-03,"AMD used to be undervalued. They may be slightly undervalued now due to people cashing out during this mining craze in preparation for the inevitable flood of used cards coming back into the market and killing revenue, but they're still floating around the right price looking at TSMC's capacity and AMD's forward projections. AMD themselves are looking at 2025 before they grow past their current value. If you're just talking memes I guess they have room to grow but I think sentiment has been turning against them due to absurd GPU prices.

Saying amd is the most innovative graphics card company is just plain crazy. They caught up to nvidia in raster performance thanks to completely dropping their compute architecture in favor of raster performance, yet they're only about nvidia level of performance even after losing significant efficiency in compute. Meanwhile you've got nvidia slapping on RT/Tensor with every gpu, codeveloping PAM4 memory and somehow managing to still provide similar raster. Catching up to your competitor by stripping utility is not innovative.

If anything AMD is being carried by its innovative CPU designs pushing chiplets years before intel while intel is praying 3dstacking closes the gap. Their GPU division however just constantly struggles and has yet to ship a competitive instinct GPU. They've basically given up on competing with nvidia in enterprise and instead are taking intel's scientific compute market with high FP64 gpus. It's led to some big supercomputer wins but overall their GPU division hasn't pushed the envelope since the 290x. Honestly I'm surprised that cray believes they will ship Frontier on schedule since AMD's instinct GPUs barely even exist, but they said they're on schedule so maybe AMD's gpu division has bigger improvements on the horizon for 5nm.",topdangle,wallstreetbets,119.0

The newest Ryzen chips are incredible, in terms of price to performance, and their newest set of graphics cards, while suffering from the same shortage as their only real competition, nVidia, have on par performance specs for 25% less. I've been an Intel/nVidia user since I built my first PC years ago, but in the last few generations of chips and cards, I've always recommended AMD products to my friends looking to build PCs. In fact, if you look on the logicalincrements website, which is a very popular resource for speccing out a new PC, each and every recommended CPU is AMD. They were small, and overlooked in the past, but they are dominating as of late.

Looking at the prices of the stocks, AMD is still less than 1/3 the market cap of NVDA, despite the fact that NVDA only makes GPUs, while AMD makes both CPUs and GPUs. If you look at Intel, they have 2.5x the market cap of AMD, and they only make CPUs.

Then finally the rare earth metals.. companies like MP, AMAT, VALE (I was long on these guys then they got a fucking $7B fine for killing 300 people in a dam explosion.... oops).

Look into Biden‚Äôs recent executive order, not only does he address the global semiconductor shortage, but plans to bring jobs back to the states and invest in American companies. MP Materials is the only US based company REM company.

They've got 10nm coming out EOY, and 3nm in 2023. They're a 5g play, there's potential gov money coming in for US based foundries, old customers will be back once they realize how unstable AMD chips are  and their gpus are looking solid.

I really, really wish JPOW had at least set up a timetable to start raising rates like Yellen did in 2016 and we would‚Äôve seen a massive sell-off and we would have known exactly where the bottom was.

There are a few companies that are transitioning to AMD but it remains speculative because intel already has most of marketshare and has new CEO and are trying to change with a new strategy.

GPU market AMD is definitely better for gaming performance to cost wise - ray tracing but they suck for professionals especially with rendering. They have a long way to catch upto CUDA cores.

I am not fully disabled (or disabled at all according to the government because I am able to work and I don't want a $900 a month handout fromm SSDI, it's unlivable) so I get by doing food deliveries until I can find a job again. I got hired at Disneyland last years, worked there for a month until it closed. 

Anyways just reading your story has me reflect on my life too. I lost another recent job right before we got the $600 stimulus so I needed that money and didn't buy in on GME when my gut said ""do it!"" I bought in after that spike at around $60 and another around $80, sold off one last week for $100 (to cover rent) but holding my only share until the next stimulus payment.

Also, for reals. I work in data storage. We're ONLY using AMD CPUs in our upcoming products. It's really simple reason why. Lanes &amp; Cost.

See INTC did this shitty thing, where their CPUs don't have that many accessory PCIe lanes for PCIe adaptor cards. Not to mention, where the fuck is INTC on PCIe G4 CPUs? So if you want the lanes you need you HAVE to get a dual processor motherboard. What does that do? Let's Intel make double the money on motherboards they sell and other Mobo vendors sell.

So what does AMD do. Come out with a single CPU with all then lanes you would need to address 20 PCIe G4 NVMe devices and 2 x16 100GbE NICs in a single CPU. And, it's FUCKING CHEAPER than a comparable INTEL CPU. Did I mention, now I don't have to deal with NUMA domains due to the single proc solution. AMD's ROME CPU architecture is just superior to Intel.

Oh did I also mention how AMD implements Intel's SW libraries so if your SW relies on one of them, it's just plug and play with AMD.

Looking at their product this will happen eventually because amd cpu is outright better, but it needs time to happen.

Also , dont count on amd fighting against nvda. The only reason amd gpu can offer a better bang for buck is because nvda never even tried. Theres just no competition.

Having too much demand for your product is one of the better problems you could have as a company, and AMD has been reporting good earnings and future guidance despite the shortage, which seems like regardless of when exactly you think will be over, will definitely ease up in the coming months/year.",DestroyerOfPussy69,wallstreetbets,16.0

19,2021-03-10,"Let me preface this by saying I'm bullish on AMD but you're connecting dots that don't make sense. Biden can't do anything about the shortage for a least a few years. A small percentage of semiconductors get produced in the US anyways. Su also said last year that the shortage would be over early 2021, well it's early 2021 and it's not over. There has been news more recent than her statement saying the shortage would last into 2022 so I wouldn't count on mid 2021. Once the supply finally does catch up sure they will make a lot of money but once the pent up demand is met there will be an oversupply as there was in 2018. The shortage has hampered AMD's ability to take advantage of their better chips. Intel spent nearly 14B on R&amp;D in 2020, I can only imagine that will go up. For reference AMD spent 2B. Intel will catch up eventually, and they still dominate market share for CPU's, laptops, and servers.",austin_jp17,wallstreetbets,19.0

People see this as a leading candidate for creating the metaverse, as imagined in sci-fi movies/books such as 'Ready Player One', in which case, it would be insanely profitable. 
They have been investing in growth and expansion, buying tech companies to improve their platform, paying for top engineering talent, and expanding internationally. They still have $1.3B cash on hand, and are not raising any money through this direct listing.

Not gonna go into details, but I just knew that with my situation I would've had to spend most of it and be left with nothing if I got a place at that time so I opted for about a year of homelessness to sort myself out.

I think if I had less money at the time I would've been more willing to just say ""fuckit, high risk time"". It seems like the more I get, the safer I play. Still regretting cashing out a little over 8k AMD shares to ""invest"" in my (at the time) friend's bullshit weed business. Luckily I only spent about $300 before I realized they were full of shit and just thought they could take advantage to skim some of my money for themselves. Was taxed like shit that year though since I took it out of my Inherited IRA though lol

Made a note to myself that year to never invest in anything I don't really want due to outside opinions of people who aren't putting in work, money or time. And yes, I knew AMD would hit $30 and was optimistic for $60. Had no clue they would hit $80 until they were at about $50. Only made about $20,000 on them when I could be a millionaire right now but I'm not as upset as I thought I'd be.

Just keep trucking dude, you'll eventually find a spot where you want to be. Just be careful because it could all go south in a matter of minutes. I'm not currently in gamestop but I did have a dream last week that it would run up to $350 in the coming weeks after it had dropped to $90, so we'll see. My dreams are usually on point.

tl;dr in 2020 there was 440B in semiconductor sales, 151.7 billion of those sales go to china, 34% of world's semiconductors are sold to china.  China currently only supplys itself with 5% of it's chips. And they want to be ""technologically self-sufficient"". China investing a lot into supplying chips for their own domestic use. This obviously means that they will be stealing a big chunk of sales from other semiconductor fab companies. Could also bring margins down.

Good evening you pieces of shit,  
Why do you keep doubling down on your short positions? Why are new hedge funds are coming in and scooping up new short positions? What the fuck are you shitstains on society doing? What the fuck is wrong with you? Do you understand who we are?  
We don‚Äôt fucking play here. We lose money for fucking breakfast. Every day. And then we come back and lose even more fucking money. We buy out of the money weeklies on fucking THURSDAYS. We don‚Äôt give a fuck. This is what we do. We do this. We don‚Äôt fucking play around. We come here to risk it all. We come here to YOLO our children‚Äôs college funds away just to post memes about it.  
Your plan was really just to put us in a position where all we have to do is hold SHARES? Say less fam. I haven‚Äôt owned a share in four years. I sold AAPL AMD and ENPH calls last week just to buy shares of GameStop and fuck you up as much as possible so we can make memes about it.  
Double down, triple down, quadruple down, take every penny of your rich boomer clients money and put it on the table. Sink the entire already artificially propped up economy over it. We know you will. And because we know you will, we are going to make you do it. Just like the coyote blindly chasing the roadrunner off of a fucking cliff. Chop off your whole head to spite your face.  
Take all your boomer ass money and put it on the table. We are here for it. My shares are available for $10,000 before 6 pm today. For every hour after that, Im asking another $250.

197,2021-03-10,"07:20 AM EST, 03/10/2021 (MT Newswires) -- Gamestop(GME) shares were up 16% pre-bell Wednesday, continuing their rally of several days, supported by the news of the appointment of Ryan Cohen to lead the company's shift to e-commerce.

Other wallstreetbets Reddit stocks were mixed. AMC (AMC) followed suit trading up 7%, and Blackberry (BB) was up 2%, while Nokia(NOK) was up 2% and Palantir(PLTR) was inching toward 1% up early Wednesday.

Other wallstreetbets Reddit stocks were down Wednesday pre-bell, including Tesla (TSLA) that traded slightly lower and UWMC that was down 1%. Rocket Cos(RKT). (RKT) was also slightly down, and so were Advanced Micro Devices(AMD) and Apple(AAPL) .

$NVDA doesn't manufacture their own chips.  Almost everyone buys them from $TSM. $NVDA, $AMD, etc, only design and assemble the chips manufactured elsewhere.

$TSM is low on chips because A. The demand is high.  And B. punative measure by the mainland on Taiwan if affecting the $TSM supply chain.

So I don't think $TSM is the play either, because I know the CCP wants to destroy that company and take their customers. Although maybe in the short term they will be able to raise prices due to demand, I don't know.


The US *really* needs their own domestic chip factory on US mainland soil.  It's a huge national security weakness.

I took a 3 year break from options, and my first dip back was making 30k on GME this week, including NARROWLY avoiding the $130 crash by selling two massively profitable ITM options literally seconds before it happened. My dick was so goddamn hard.

Anyways, it's getting withdrawn to cash, because I know I'll spend that shit on FDs in search of a new high. I'm already riding some AMD FD's for next week, as well as SQ and some dumb shit some other retard suggested called GOEV.

The top-weighted technology sector (+1.9%) is the best performer in the early going while four other groups also show gains of 1.0% or more.

Key factors driving today's performance include:

* Leadership from high-beta chipmakers. The PHLX Semiconductor Index (+3.3%) has returned into positive territory for the week thanks to gains in all 30 components. The group is now up 1.9% for the week versus a 3.2% week-to-date gain in the Nasdaq (+2.0%). *South China Morning Post* reported overnight that the U.S. and China established a working group aimed at ""easing export controls"" and ""improving supply chain security.""
* Strong showing from the largest components by weight. **Apple** (**AAPL** 122.05, +2.07, +1.7%), **Microsoft** (**MSFT** 236.54, +4.12, +1.8%), and **Visa** (**V** 226.79, +3.62, +1.6%) are all up more than 1.0%.

**Notable movers:**

* **Qorvo** (**QRVO** 175.15, +9.78, +5.9%): best performer in the sector, rallying back above its 50-day moving average (174.20).
* **ServiceNow** (**NOW** 498.88, +24.88, +5.3%): reclaiming its 200-day moving average (485.36).
* **Skyworks** (**SWKS** 174.48, +6.82, +4.1%): rising back above its 50-day moving average (171.42).
* **AMD** (**AMD** 79.96, +2.44, +3.2%): rising back above its 200-day moving average (78.77).
* **NVIDIA** (**NVDA** 515.88, +17.15, +3.4%): trading near yesterday's high.
* **PayPal** (**PYPL** 250.78, +8.71, +3.6%): rising toward its 50-day moving average (254.04).
* **Fortinet** (**FTNT** 185.41, +4.95, +2.7%): rallying to a fresh record high.
* **Broadcom** (**AVGO** 451.78, +14.19, +3.2%): rising toward its 50-day moving average (458.99).
* **Visa** (**V** 226.79, +3.62, +1.6%): rallying to a fresh record.
* **Apple** (**AAPL** 122.05, +2.07, +1.7%): rising to a one-week high.
* **Oracle** (**ORCL** 66.81, -5.31, -7.4%): weakest performer in the sector despite beating Q3 expectations, issuing above-consensus guidance for Q4, and raising its dividend.",Moral_Insanity,wallstreetbets,147.0

186,2021-03-11,"Just saw this and figured I'd respond if you're interested. The past 3 days really means nothing. If you pick companies that are legitimately growing then volatility doesn't matter as much in the long term. Stocks go up and stocks go down. I held AMD and watched it go between 26 and 32 for months, then it rocketed to 50+ and got close to 100. It recently went all the way down to the mid 70s, or close to a 25% drop from its all time high. Am I selling? No, because the past weeks/months is a tiny blip on the radar in the grand scheme of things. Whether the stock does well in the future will depend on the overall success of the company, not whether a bunch of boomers decided to rotate out of tech in Feb/March before most likely buying up the dip later on (which may have already started the past few days).

191,2021-03-11,"I got into this knowing as much as Jon Snow.  I had every intention on getting into stocks specifically I wanted a portfolio of positions on AMD TSM NVDA UMC, I wanted to go all in long on silicon manufacturers for starters.  Even my IRA was holding ETF called FTEC spread across the same sectors.  I bought 1 @ 95 end of Jan after squeeze 1.  That and 2x AMD was my entry into the market.  It's important to state I'm paying off a huge chunk of debt this month and I'm disciplined on that goal, taxes came back, both fed and state went immediately to the debt both checks.  The upcoming stimmie will do the same.  So in here with my limited $400 play money I skimmed off non market investments.  I watched my GME stalemate at $40 and paper handed.  That decision I regretted while doing it but not a few days later, I realized I had to revert that mistake and wash sell'd myself back in 1 share for $135.  Days later i upped my position averaging down with a single share but at $120.  Just days ago I sold off my FTEC at a minimal loss, it had been rising very slowly after tanking so it cost me about $3 to exit the position and land another GME share with the rest going bullish into VGAC. 

Cut to yesterday's big dipper event, by this time I was mentally prepared.  I had done tons of market research outside of reddit, I've read many DD post inside of reddit, and i realized the side the media was on and knew they were begging us to let them be.  So just seconds after my buddy holding bags at a 300+average messages me and says we came back for him boom.  In my timezone we're talking 11:45am.  I was walking out the door for lunch in 5 minutes.  I looked, I laughed, I closed active trader pro, and I loaded up uncle Bruce on my cell to listen in my car while I drove to lunch confident this was artificial.  One key point I heard a few times during my market research was an artificial movement in stock almost always rebounds in the opposite direction but to a slightly higher degree (albeit artificial in the context of those in learning from usually means a stark movement without the volume to match).

I'm a tiny bag holder but I was proud of my damn self for not even attempting to load up a sell tab on active trader pro at $180 to protect myself from total loss. I laughed it off knowing we'd swallow the dip like a porn star and enjoyed my lunch.",dreamsforgotten,wallstreetbets,191.0

Also, we don't need to do trials in USA amd can submit foreign clinical data procured by IQVIA

Astrazeneca has already submitted data from UK for EUA and NVAX will also submit UK data in may.

Enough doses for entire population ? I don't think so there are 80 million under the age group of 18 and covaxin can be given as booster shots to all of those who have taken other vaccines to fend of strains.

I like AMD and have a ryzen myself, but I think they are ar a solid spot and observing them for a long time just shows that people still appreciate what they do with ryzen, but that it's not really news anymore.
The big thing was how AMD seemingly came back from the dead swinging. But that's a few years back already and chip shortage hits them as much as anyone else.
Intel is nothing for short term right now, completely agree. But I am positive that they will be back in a year or so. They took some steps to bring back engineering into the companys top positions rather than just business people. The chances are good that this will get them back in form.

So imma blow your mind ... what if AMD keeps their foot on the pedal and Intel never catches up? To me that's just as likely except prices are right for buying AMD right now. AMD makes up \~3% of the datacenter market, with their Zen 3 datacenter CPU coming out next week and TSMC investing 30 billion in production and building a fab in the US, it's still Intel's market share to lose and AMD's to win. Michael Cohen rated AMD as his #2 stock pick behind GOOG. It's a #1 BUY on Cramer's Action Alerts Club. Average price target is $103, high is $161. Stock is way below that.

9,2021-04-03,"If Nvidia does acquire ARM (highly unlikely) China would be blocked from making chips and they're not gonna react kindly. Take that as you will.

There is nothing stopping Intel and AMD from producing ARM chips except for themselves. They already have the licenses and will begin developing when ARM is past its infancy in the data center world. Let deeper pockets be the pioneers, let all the software transitions happen (x86 software is not compatible with ARM), then poach their engineers. Intel and AMD are sitting back and letting AWS and Apple try their hand at ARM on purpose.

IBM thrived on providing services that were being phased out. x86 isn't going to be phased out this decade and Intel will begin ARM chip production for clients in 3 years. IBM is dying, Intel is 3 years away from the start of unrivaled growth and has potential to eventually surpass TSMC as the industry leader in chip production thanks to the gov/mil backing within 20 years.

If you're looking for big gains in the next 2-6 years Intel is probably not the stock for you. It's at a 13 P/E ratio because people perceive it like IBM which is fine with me, I'll keep adding.

No clue what TSMC will plan to do after 3nm to prevent stagnation. For now they are the leader but physics doesn't let you go smaller than 3nm, possibly 2nm.

As far as investment goes, having your own fabs is great, until it's not, like we've seen over the past 3 years. What tips the scales in AMDs favor IMO is their involvement in GPUs as well as CPUs.

17,2021-04-02,"Intel is only shipping *their* 10nm (the ""fixed"" one, their 3rd shot at a decent 10nm process) in a meaningful way in client CPUs, only laptops.

Their 10nm Ice Lake SP server CPU is probably going to be a train wreck, hopefully they deliver something useful with the follow-up Sapphire Rapids later this year.

Meanwhile AMD's TSMC 7nm servers were launched in summer of *2019*. This time to market gap is more likely to increase as AMD's financial position improves, allowing it to invest in bleeding edge processes the way Apple does.

INTC warrants a shitload of skepticism for having lost such a commanding process lead over the span of just a few years, and then boldly claiming that they're going to retake a leadership position after they already paid their key people to retire, and TSM is planning something like 2-3x INTC's planned CAPEX.

Not even talking about the plan for INTC to work as third party foundry because that's gonna be a shitshow.

The reality is that Intel is locked into a course of about 2 more years of collapsing gross margins due to the current state of affairs, and the only reason their market share loss won't be catastrophic is AMD doesn't have enough capacity to take more.

Intel is going to have to price its products next to dirt in order to retain anything.

AMD, Nvidia, and Apple all depend on TSMC/Samsung to make their CPU/GPU chips.  


Intel is also about to announce their GPUs made by TSMC that will compete with AMD and Nvidia in the Gaming/AI/Machine Learning space.  


As you pointed out, when they're on the same node Intel CPUs outperform AMD CPUs by a wide margin. As it stands their 14nm are still pretty competitive with AMD's 7nm. Also from a physics stand point to go below 3nm will be quantum computing (some argue 2nm will be achievable but it's unlikely).  


And once Intel hits 3nm it's going to wipe the floor with the competition. In 15 years Intel will be the leader with a market cap nearly as large as AMD, Nvidia, and TSMC combined. The fact that their P/E ratios are 35-80 while Intel is at 13 shows me the markets are not efficient.

https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/

This is many years past but Intel was/is? horrifically flawed in culture, strategy , technology.

And that isn't going to change quickly I'd be very careful about placing any long bets on Intel in the future.  Perhaps this can change with their new ceo.

Telling people Intel is competitive is blatantly false imo (I'm retired now so I don't work in the datacenter field and I no longer keep tabs on tech that closely) 

You've got Apple that has gone away from intel and in my short time of owning an M1 macbook air, I can tell you this thing blows away anything intel has by miles, the battery life, the heat, the fanless design, the speed in the cpu, the gpu is light years ahead of whatever intel has.  

AMD is going to continue to own Intel in the datacenter space, it owns them in the enthusiast market, intel still had a good hold of the oem market through shady bribes and deals etc.

48,2021-04-04,"Thanks for the critique. I was trying to explain all these in laymen terms without going into the technical details, but I guess some parts were not clear enough. But since you asked, I might as well elaborate more here.

The US-China decoupling will only happen for intermediate goods (components that are used in the production of final goods that will be purchased by end consumers). For example, instead of using the US's Android OS, Huawei phones are now using their own HongMeng OS. Supply chain decoupling does not imply the ban of final goods from China (Huawei phones) in the US. You can still [buy](https://www.cnet.com/google-amp/news/despite-ban-you-can-still-buy-huawei-phones-in-the-us-heres-how/) Huawei phones in the US, just that not many people would want to buy them due to the lack of Google Mobile Services and Google Play store for these Huawei phones (cannot download apps easily). This affects Huawei's sale in the US.

Now for connected and autonomous vehicles which does not yet have any dominant app ecosystems like Android or iOS yet. This time, with the Chinese having the capability to influence the growth of an emerging tech sector, do you think the Chinese will support an American OS + platform + app ecosystem and risk getting banned again and losing their global sales?

Of course, China can build their own OS + platform + app ecosystem but it is unlikely to gain traction beyond their domestic market because they lack the deep technical capability/maturity (HongMeng OS turned out to be just an Android clone) or the influence to convince app developers outside China to develop apps for them. 

I think you might have underestimated the importance of standards and abstractions in the tech industry.
&gt;The world runs windows on AMD and Intel
This only works precisely because both AMD and Intel chips support the x86-64 Instruction Set Architecture, where programs are compiled to the same assembly code which is interoperable across Intel and AMD chips. There is a reason you cannot run a desktop software on an Android smartphone with a Qualcomm chip because smartphones uses the ARM architecture. Again, in the smartphone world, Android can run on Qualcomm Snapdragon, Huawei's Kirin, Samsung's Exynos chips, precisely because all these chips support the ARM Instruction Set Architecture.

Now, such interoperability layer (analogous to x86-64 for desktop CPUs and ARM for smartphone CPUs) has not existed  for the connected and autonomous vehicle yet. My main focus in this article is to put forward my view that this interoperability layer is unlikely to come from any American or Chinese companies because each of them will not accept any proposed standards from the other side. It has to come from a third party (not necessarily Canada, can be any other countries). But ruling out Chinese and American tech companies, Blackberry is the only frontrunner left capable of driving this industry standard forward.",Character-Cup-2263,wallstreetbets,48.0

So their announcement had to be true. There was no way they would have been lying back then as it would have meant the end for them as a company. And that's why buying AMD back in 2016 was a 100% justifiable investment.

Still a good investment. I predict AMD to grab further market share from Intel. Especially in mobile devices and servers. They're already doing great on desktop with Threadripper and Ryzen.

Financial advisors are not gamers. People who play pc games have steam accounts with hundreds of games already. Why would they buy anything from gamestop? 

Additionally, if you think about it, kids who ask for computers are very tech savvy, and they'll be able to find the best fuckin deals. 

I doubt they'll be at gamestop. 

Let me ask you this: how much is best buy worth? Mmhm?

How much is AMD worth? Hmm..??

I definitely think long long long long long long term this stock will not be left behind.

Regarding the DD. The people doing the DD are strangers on the internet. They more than likely are just looking to get some level of clout or fame.


Who the fuck knows what's gonna happen? This comment may not age well if the squeeze is that big. 

I will put money into the stock at the next accumulation phase next week. But I would NOT put my rent money.

You can sit in NOK until the cows come home but you are losing money every day. Its float is huge. I dont care if its being manipulated.

If price is stagnant you aren't making money unless you are employing some option strategies and are holding a butt ton of shares.

Again, you can sit in that stock and wait until it moves while you lose money to inflation and missing moves you could have been in. When will it move? You dont know. And management doesnt seem to care if the stock rises.Look at the yearly chart its flat as a board except for that meme spike. You can sit and wait. But sure as hell wouldnt.

I got out after my L and am already up 6k. If you dont mind holding I would stay far the fuck away from meme stonks and buy any bluechip or decent company with good numbers. Hell if you want to play it riskier look at 3x ETFs. Direxion has a ton of good ones. Buy on a dip day.

123,2021-04-06,"&gt; No doubt that AMD is  a good buy, many speculate 120 till the end of the  year. But I wanna see further than that, sure Amazon and many others  bought Epyc servers now, but what happens in 3-5 years when the support  expires and they need new ones? 

Amazon will probably use their own cpus. Their ""Graviton"" design is highly efficient and, depending on the task, already as fast as the older AMD Epyc designs. This of course will also affect Intel sales numbers, when a company like Amazon uses their own cpus instead of buying at AMD or Intel. What in five years will happen, nobody can tell. A few years back, ARM based cpus were considered low performance designs and look where we are, now. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Also, X86 must probobly die, you know why? Electricity! The biggest  threat to the expansion except the shortage of chips, it¬¥s in fact  electricity. Here in Sweden the growth of servers, cloud and so on is  about 20%, electricity about 4-5 %. 

As I said: x86 is a RISC design on the inside, while appearing CISC on the outside. Both ARM and modern x86 designs are on a comparable level of power efficiency. What we really would need is better efficiency using all that tech. Remember the first Iphone and remember what it could do, back in 2007? Phones basically do the same now, but are using a 8\*2800 Mhz cpu design instead of the 600 Mhz single core the first Iphone had. What I'm saying is that we have an abundance of raw calculation power on our servers and our clients and we're wasting it. The growth everywhere wouldn't be the same, if resources were used in a more efficent way. 

 

&gt;And sure, current mobile Ryzen is on par with Apple M1, but it¬¥s the first laptop chip, think about that!  
&gt;  
&gt;Sure, you can make X86 chips efficient but you will take a massive hit on speed.

Yeah, it's their first laptop cpu design. But it's using one of the most advanced manufacturing processes from TSMC (5nm node). AMD's still using their 7 nm node and yet, the mobile Ryzen cpus are pretty much as power efficient as their Apple counterparts. AMD laptops with the current APU design can last up to 20 hours without a charge, that's two workdays and it's highly efficient.

&gt; It¬¥s not about that, right now i.e. AMD, Nvidia and Apple relies alot on  TSMC and Samsung, which the government does not like, that¬¥s why Intel  is also probobly a really good investment. 

Here's a big one: The European Union has plans to spend a huge pile of money to increase its share in the chip market to 20% by 2030. We're talking billions of ‚Ç¨. So overall, the dependency on fabs in Asia will reduce till the end of this decade. Intel has, from what I remember, plans too, for creating or upgrading fabs in the US.",ckerazor,wallstreetbets,123.0

125,2021-04-06,"No doubt that AMD is  a good buy, many speculate 120 till the end of the year. But I wanna see further than that, sure Amazon and many others bought Epyc servers now, but what happens in 3-5 years when the support expires and they need new ones? 

Also, X86 must probobly die, you know why? Electricity! The biggest threat to the expansion except the shortage of chips, it¬¥s in fact electricity. Here in Sweden the growth of servers, cloud and so on is about 20%, electricity about 4-5 %. 

And sure, current mobile Ryzen is on par with Apple M1, but it¬¥s the first laptop chip, think about that! 

Sure, you can make X86 chips efficient but you will take a massive hit on speed.

127,2021-04-06,"Not so sure about that. Current Ryzen mobile is pretty much on par with Apple M1. x86 are essentially RISC designs now, so there's no reason why they should fall behind pure ARM designs. 

ARM's looking at further growths, true. Amazon designed their own ARM cpus for server usage. Those are already in AMD Epyc territory, so things are gonna get interesting. 

Intel is still a major player, has their own fabs, has a large stack of products for every imaginable use case. My guess is: Both manufactures will continue their existance, as if one would go south, government would step in as we'd look at a world monopoly, if there was only one x86 cpu designer/manufacturer.

22,2021-04-08,"&gt;I like AMD as a company and I think they have a great business model right now.But I think the stock almost has to come down about 15 to 20 bucks.  When the Electric money frenzy ends it has to come down a little.  Plus the surge in demand for Silicon over the pandemic.  A lot of people were buying PCs at inflated prices because they were stuck at home.  Now, they can actually go outside.  If the digital money bubble pops AMD might hit 50 - 60.They are beating the crap out of intel in benchmarks.  But, they are still getting kicked around by nVidia.  Plus, the next phase of computing is custom ARM chips.  Intel is getting into it.  Microsoft is getting into it and a number of others.  Don't get me wrong AMD can compete.   But, they are not going to be gaining 20 percent annually.

But also diversify a bit among sectors...  so I've got some DKNG, NCLH, CCL, DIS

Meme stocks are fine, but buy when cheap as fuck and with calls get them a bit out.  Some shit has stupid premiums.  Don't buy those.

When the market is doing great and everything is on fire, that's not the time to buy.  That's the time to unwind positions and take profits.

When shit sells off, you have you have to have a big pile of cash on hand to buy with.  If all your shit bled down during a sell off you can't buy the bottom.

Made a bunch of money on GME in March.  Then lost 20% of it because I was buying everything high.  Managed to get out as Nasdaq corrected down 10%.  But I had been watching all that shit.

When MU was around 80, LRCX was 550, AMAT 95... I bought a shit ton of calls cheap as fuck.  Same thing with the BB dip and cruise lines.

Then as it went up I started taking profits.

Did I sell AMAT and LRCX too soon.  Fuck yeah.  Did I buy back in.  Fuck no.  I'm not buying shit now.  I'm just taking profits.

When shit tanks back down I will buy calls again.  Am I missing out on shit.  Fuck yeah.  But my portfolio value is growing and I've got a ton of fucking ammo when prices come down.

Also once shit reaches 100%, I always sell half and cover my investment.  Now if it starts to sell off I'm good and can exit and still have gain overall.  I can also have the balls to let it moon because my risk is now zero.",I_like_to_build,wallstreetbets,130.0

The last industry to sky rocket back to pre-pandemic prices are cruise stocks and once they do, hold on to your butts. Norwegian (NCL) is poised to rebound heavily as they are still drastically down from their prior highs and I feel that soon they will jump back up.

Royal Caribbean (RCL) has told Florida that they will pack their shit up and move their fleet to another country if they aren‚Äôt allowed to sail soon. Considering y‚Äôall can go to a movie theater now, I feel Florida and the CDC will oblige given the strict rules the industry is now imposing.

NCL is on an upswing in both volume and price considering this move and the plunging wick on the candle today. Telling me it touched lower and would like to begin the ascend back to glory.

23,2021-04-09,"Well....started 'investing' back when the first /u/ironyman meme came out, about his box spreads and breaking robinhood. I put 80 bucks in to buy 3 shares of AMD before their earnings, because I knew their 7nm cards would be hot. I made 20 dollars.

Thought..wow, if only I'd used options instead! Then I got really lucky one FED interest rate day, popped from 2k to 6k...then held overnight due to PDT worries, lost half in my sleep. Let the rest of my FD's bleed out and went essentially back down to my original investment +1k or something.

This brought on the 'tilt' trading. I was throwing 1k at VXX FD's and not selling at the right time, then some tard on here was saying ""mortgage your house and buy this Boeing dip"". I was all in boeing for a bit, that killed me. I kept throwing money in and occasionally turning a brief profit only to throw it back on the fire.

(and I also have losses on etrade and TDA, my only success has been my passively invested Roth where I hold gold miner penny stocks and sell covered calls, up 55%...)

2,2021-04-09,"(Coming in from r\all with no involvement in the GME thing, although I do have some long term holdings in Procter &amp; Gamble, Intel, and AMD) Since you're a PhD candidate of psychology, I hope you wouldn't mind if I ask you a couple questions that I've been wondering about for a while now.

I noticed that a lot of PhD candidates are always doing their dissertations on ""why this one thing is a cult or why that other is a cult""; everything no matter how radical or benign is always being evaluated as a cult for some reason, isn't that a bit derivative? That realistically just boils down to the candidates copying each other's dissertations and changing the subject of the research topic.

Also, you mention that you *""can make shit up about a ""big squeeze"", short laddering, etc""*. If you're openly saying that you're going to pad the conversation to drive it (and thus your data and the extended insights) in a certain direction, wouldn't that fall under data manipulation, which if caught, could cost you your PhD candidacy? It really doesn't seem like it's worth the risk to say that openly.

-----

Lastly, I noticed that you appear to be using the term ""retardation"" more as a slur than a medical term. From what I understand, at best that's a misapplication of functioning medical terminology and at worst it's intentional and inflammatory misuse of dialogue to drive manipulate and drive your research results to a non-objective conclusion (which I've actually already asked about once).

I'm a bit surprised that your candidacy mentor and your advisors would allow such a thing, mentors and advisors are usually pretty strict about objective research, at least in my experience talking to friends who are PhD candidates in the engineering fields. If you don't mind me asking, what university are you and your mentors and advisors at, could you provide any names or titles?

I've been a fellow ape since long before the the days of [u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/) *and* [u/1ronyman](https://www.reddit.com/u/1ronyman/)\*,\* when we used to be praying for the mooning of $AMD, $NVDA, and our forgotten friend $JNUG (and my other favorite 3x leveraged ETFs like $WTIU). I since saw the light and YOLO'd my money into TSLA, SHOP, SQ, and some alternative assets, generating interdimensional returns of about 500% in the past year. All of this was on Robinhood. I poured my entire life savings into Robinhood. I even borrowed some money from my mom to invest. (Sadly still tied up in GME @ $380).

I now wanted to buy my first home. I was excited that I could afford it with all of these gainz. I was excited I could make an all cash offer because that's what it takes with these foreign buyers running the market. But then I found out that the evil villains of RobinHood would not allow me to take my money out! RobinHood limits you from withdrawing **a MAXIMUM of $50,000 per BUSINESS DAY.** They're doing you dirty worse than they did to Harambe.

We must get the word out that **your money in RobinHood is not yours!**

16,2021-05-02,"That's true, but the chip shortage has slowed their market share growth. The fear with AMD is that this shortage will give Intel the appropriate headroom to mount an offensive without losing as much ground as they probably should have. Thats the reason for the short, by the time AMD is able to actually take advantage of their market position, Intel could have a real response ready to take Epyc and Ryzen in core count, price and performance. Not to mention Intel's relationship with OEMs and system integrators is still light years ahead of AMD. 

 Intel in 2017 expected AMD to improve 5 to 10% each generation...they weren't expecting AMD to be knocking on their door in 3 years with 15 to 20% gains per generation. They were caught flatfooted and realized they had to stop acting like a monopoly and take AMD seriously

RKT has two BILLION shares outstanding. 95% of them belong to Dan. They have 30 billion in debt with 15 billion in revenue. Volume from retail will NOT move it this time.

They have a current opportunity in the short term to take some market share from AMD with the current GPU shortage. They are coming out with their own GPU, which will sell like crazy, even if it is complete garbage. All on Intel processors have in built graphics, which run decent. AMD's chips don't have any of that. Considering no one can buy a GPU right now, if I was building a pc and didn't have a GPU, I would have to go with Intel to even use my computer, and once you do that, you won't change your CPU for a couple years at least.

Another factor, Intel is changing their chips, along with AMD, to dividing 8 cores into 4 small efficient and 4 large ones. This is similar to what ARM chips does. They also are coming up on 10 nm, hopefully without any delays. They have a CEO in charge who is an engineer from the early stages of the company, the are coming out with a 7nm TILE design, similar to AMD's chiplet design, and also did I mention how much cash they have? 5 billion in raw cash. You can do a lot with that.

Not to mention its very dangerous to have a concentration of foundries in Taiwan, and yes TSMC is building one in the US in a couple years, but a lot can happen.

I think people expect these companies to do so well that when they do just well, it's just not enough, and they get out, plus there's a bunch of FUD out there, and it's easy to tank a stock by spreading it. But AMD is an outlier IMO. They've proven to do very well over the years, and they've become a huge player. Intel is in big trouble with Apple M1, and AMD has always been in between Intel and NVIDIA. In a few years we'll see the same shift from NVIDIA to AMD that we saw from Intel to AMD. It's a matter of time.

Think 85M short + 45M shares in call options. Hedge funds will drive down the price..

Last week was similar..

I have been monitoring the Options and Short sellers and I posted last week what my expectation was based on the Call/put ratio. I posted the chart in the r/AMD_Stock channel.

Simplistically, AMD has

1. 85% of the shares held by institutions
2. Short portion as of 04/15 is approx 83M shares 6-7% of the float.
3. OPTIONS on the other hand, had approx 14+M shard above 82. Which meant, market makers and hedge funds would have lost a pretty coin if the shares went up.

We saw that in Q4 Blow out earning, call options vastly exceeded put, and the shares tanked. April 30th after Q1 blow out earnings, the big cutoff was 82$, so short sellers, predominately the hedge funds selling those contracts, drove the price down.

This week is no different, with one minor exception, XLINIX is reporting on May 4th.

The ONLY 2 ways we can change this, 1 is in our control, the other waiting for the Chinese gov to approve the merger transaction (that would be big news).

Here is what I suggest we should do:

1- If you have shares, put a LIMIT SELL order at $1000/share. That will make you shares unavailable for naked shorting. The less shares available the more it costs short seller to borrow and short sell. KEEP in mind, the short seller position AMD has is not that big. BUT and this is a BIG ONE, the combination of the short seller position and the CALL CONTRACTS in the next 4 months is MASSIVE. THUS the pressure and potential squeeze.

2- BUY and hold shares, and repeat number step number 1

3- buy call options (NOT WITH SHORT TERM EXPIRY).

THIS IS NOT AN INVESTMENT ADVICE, merely observation on what I have been seeing and continue to see with one my favourite companies. Let's make it painful for the short sellers and hedge funds.

68,2021-05-04,210% agreed AMD(team red) is a great buy they already lead the industry in cpus and have matched or surpassed nvidia in gpus depending on the benchmark. They have three different gaming platforms PlayStation Xbox and Windows 4 if you include Linux. They have had these platforms for awhile but their gpus sucked so it wasn‚Äôt that beneficial now it‚Äôs a different story. As a gamer and a developer I can tell you amd is destroying the cpu market. For the first time ever I now have a choice of amd when buying a web server. Amd makes more powerful cpus that draw far less power it‚Äôs only a matter of time before companies like Amazon start switching over to save power for computing and cooling. With gaming supporting their gpu division we might even start to see amd take market share from nvidia when it comes to data center because even though nvidia has them beat in ai task team reds gpus again draw less power. On top of all of this the have opened some of their gpu tools to the public by making them open source which will see huge support from the developer community which could make them leaders of industry standards in gpus. However I am curious to see what happens with apple since apple has been using their gpus for their MacBook Pro. If don‚Äôt continue to use it with the M1 I wonder how that will affect amd. At the moment I feel like this would only free up space for them to produce other chipsets that are in extreme demand but I guess we will see.,New-Ad133,wallstreetbets,68.0

XLNX shareholders are getting 1.7234 shares of AMD in exchange for their XLNX shares. XLNX has 245.77m shares outstanding. This means 423.56m shares of AMD will be issued to XLNX shareholders. This equals an increase of $33b in market cap in regard to AMDs current price. 

BUT here‚Äôs the kicker. AMD gets about $31b worth of stuff (namely all of XLNX‚Äôs assets/their market cap). AMD probably reaps some benefits in the form of synergies as well. 

How much? Who knows. Maybe AMD is overpaying a tad maybe they are getting a good deal in terms of the savings they reap with consolidation. But any move upward in XLNX should at least allow AMD to follow.

What you're not seeing is the share dilution will be equal to the acquisition. So once the merger is complete the value should more or less be the same.  

It's like borrowing money to build an extension to your house. Yes, you pick up greater debt but that debt goes into the value of the house. So sure, on the surface it looks like a loss for current shareholders if you don't include the value of the acquisition to the acquiring company but that would be an oversight.

Must be a lot of donkeys over there. Moore's law is dead. We're pretty close to peak processor die composition across the board. GPUs are not a large enough market to drive the 30x P/E in AMD. When the inflationary cycle commits and the CPI goes up, AMD's performance will take a big hit, and their share price will tank. AMD has almost no market share in enterprise and they're failing to break in. Their commercial consumer base is low. Their end user base is higher but they've been unable to release enough product to move the needle due to COVID. Again, when inflation starts its corrective march, end user discretionary spending will vanish and AMD will finally have stock on shelf and no one buying.

INTC: the most recent target price range is $42-80, with the average of $66; before the last earnings call, the stock was up 1.47% since February 14, 2020 (ie since before the covid dump); down 16% since then and currently sitting at $57.26. Q1 revenue $19.67B, net income $3.36B, EPS (diluted) $0.82, NPM 17.08%.

AMD: the most recent target price range is $95-125, with the average of $104; before the last earnings call, the stock was up 53% since February 14, 2020; down 12% since then and currently sitting at $78.55; Q1 revenue $3.44B, net income $555M, EPS (diluted) $0.45, NPM 16.11%.

Don‚Äôt really have a point; just having a beer and looking at numbers. Also, lol at 1.47% for Intel in over a year (although, it is -15% now, after the earnings dump).

For example, if you work in construction, you learned about rising lumber prices before everyone else, and know which companies could keep up with the demand. If you work in airlines you see when traffic is starting to increase, and which companies are handling the rapidly changing environment the best. If you work with tech, you knew when AMD finally became a serious competitor to Intel. 

If you have a hunch, add the stock to your watchlist, compare their quarter earnings performances to their yearly price chart, and keep your eye on volume. Webull and Robinhood have everthing you need to know even if you don't buy through them. It's amazing to me how many people keep buying SNDL with 100 million in volume every day. That stock is being scalped to death. Low volume and strong price support is the time to buy in.

76,2021-05-07,"Options are, funnily enough, accurately named.

Note for everything else: option contracts are sold in lots of 100, so ""one"" call contract actually means 100 of the underlying asset.

A **call** option gives you the option to buy the underlying stock at the specified price in the contract at any time until the option expires. So in the shorthand used here, a 5/21 85c means, any time from now until May 21st, I have the option to purchase 100 of that stock at $85, *regardless of the current price.* So if I think that the stock will be trading at, say $90, between now and May 21st, I would buy a Call Option, because then, when the stock is trading at 90, I can buy it at 85, profiting from the difference in price.

&amp;nbsp;

A **put** option is the reverse, it gives you the option, at any time from purchase until expiration, to short the underlying asset at the specified price.

&amp;nbsp;

The risk of options is in the price to purchase the contracts. The price is listed per stock, so the actual price you pay for the right to that contract is 100x. For example, 5/21 85c AMD call might cost you $0.40 per stock, or $40/contract.

&amp;nbsp;

The reason people like options is because they drastically multiply your earnings. I may be able to only afford, say, 10 AMD stock at $80, but I can buy 2-3 July calls for $85, representing a stake of 300 AMD stock. That essentially means if AMD goes up, I earn many more times the profit than I would have by owning straight stock.

&amp;nbsp;

On the other hand, unlike stock, options that expire unprofitable go all the way to $0, while stocks tend to retain some value.",cantadmittoposting,wallstreetbets,76.0

Less power, less heat, good performance. ARM server farms are set to become a reality. Not today, but soon. 

When Intel talks about being a year or two behind, they dont mean apple, they mean in the NM space on general. TDP  And performance per watt is becoming king in a lot of futures discussions in IT rooms across the US. Right now, Intel might lead in performance in a lot of areas, bit a year from now a lot of ecosystems are going to run to competitors (AMD) or even apple in some rare few environments (since apple killed server hardware but kept the serverOS, I only really see this in small marketing and graphic design businesses).

I still think in 3 to 4 years, Intel will be at the top again, but expect them to dip for a little while as they work it all out.

Intel and AMD build chipsets around different philosophies. AMD builds cheap and wide, Intel builds innovation on pipeline efficiencies.

I don't invest in either right now, but (in the past) they essentially diametrically swapped for each other in terms of gains/losses marketwise. Ride AMD for a while, then sell and ride Intel on market news. Rinse and repeat.

52,2021-06-04,"As time progresses, computing tasks aren't becoming less robust. They‚Äôre becoming more demanding, which increases the need for GPUs and chipmakers like AMD along with competitors such as Intel. These products are getting used heavily in today's market, and all though bears were out in full force within the 2015 time frame, AMD was still a company that produced a need and had the potential to evolve. Can BB do the same? Possibly, although 2008 was a breaking year for BB, this was a direct result of the popularity of their creation, the BB Bold. I'm not saying BB cellular phones aren't used today nor their technology, e.g.,  within the business sector but when APPL established their dominance with the iPhone and Blackberry's response was the Storm. That indicated to me that APPL is telling BB to move over. Again, could BB reach the price of the current APPL price? Sure, however, APPL will exceed that price and BB will once again play catch-up.

69,2021-06-04,"DLSS is effectively dead after FSR announcement long term. For RTX voice replacement you can use Krisp. And there are also other solutions AIBs provide but I haven't tried them.

And you may say FSR looks worse. But it doesn't matter we already know that decent upscaling is possible due to recent TSR EU5 stuff we've seen, which looks quite good.

So if FSR is missing temporal data to generate better images we know its possible and FSR will for sure improve over time.

The fact that Intel is also looking at supporting it and the fact that consoles are in AMD camp on this one tells me this will be just like FreeSync killing Gsync.

May not happen this year but I don't see it surviving passed that. FSR being open source also makes it a lot easier to implement whereas DLSS is a black box.

$GME, $AMC, $BB, $XL, $WKHS, $CLOV, $NOK, $CLNE, $BLNK, $BBBY, $CLVS, $BYND, $INO... Just to name a few that'll make waves if they haven't already. 

Waiting for this cycle of mania to cool just a bit before buying more LEAPs. Already worked GME and AMC now I'm in BB. Buying shares, LEAPs, selling calls... I played puts a few times but did get burned a few others so my form of not being greedy right now is leaving puts out of it. 

On BB I just bought a bunch of shares, sold CCs, used premium for more shares, and more CCs. 

One of three things will happen - It pops while I have CC's out and my gains are capped. But the CC's are sold at strikes 25%+ of my average, so in that case, 25% gain + premium. It pops without CC's out and I go for a ride. OR, it doesn't pop, but this IV reduced my losses (on GME, I actually gained because of premium, not underlying), and you move on but not holding bags or at least ones that aren't so heavy.

Losses will happen. But the gain potential is too good to ignore and in these cases you only have to be right once and 10% gain on AMC is no different than say 10% on something ""smart"" like AMD. 10% is 10%.",lJustLurkingl,wallstreetbets,28.0

If you switch to a Cash Account, you have unlimited day trades. Margin account holds you to the 3 day trades limit unless you have a balance over $25K (I do not have that much). I bought CLOV an hour after pre market opened at $13.50 and sold on the way down (after that morning spike) for $21.70 and didn't look back. I was hoping for 10% but was willing to ride it if it was going up. I held a little passed the the peak, to make sure it wasn't just a small dip. When I knew it was crashing, I got out. This may not be the ""best"" strategy, but it works for me. I don't trade big money. To be clear, I YOLO'd all of my ""play"" money on 8 shares of CLOV. When I stack up a few hundred bucks, I cash out all but my original $200 I started with and use that to fund my bourbon amd cigar hobbies. Had a good month? Drink and smoke like a baller. Bad month? Rot gut and floor clippings rolled up. Good luck, dude.

25,2021-06-09,So you honestly believe $80 is the correct price for AMD when they were $90+ last winter without any of the aforementioned events. This behavior will not last until 2023,Wojofoo,wallstreetbets,25.0
26,2021-06-09,"While I agree with this dd it should be pointed out that Nvidia is especially high because their particular cards are in demand by miners.  This has left a demand amongst gamers who want both amd and Nvidia cards.  It's because of miners wanting Nvidia cards that amd video card have gone up intended with gamers. 

Otherwise I would agree that amd is still undervalued. They have phenomenal cpus compared to what they have had before and are able to charge more for them, making intel drop their prices for the first time in a decade.  Amd is a true competitor again but from my tech vantage, they have been in the game a while but they have never been the leader. They haven't quite taken that spot in any field but they are neck and neck with intel right now imo with cpus.  With gpus Nvidia has consistently had better drivers and has a better history with many.

41,2021-06-08,"Lets disect this:  

&gt; The chips Sony uses are manufactured by Sony and a company named AMD.

Wrong, Sony manufactures the PS5, the PS5 uses a custom designed Zen3/RDNA2 APU designed by AMD, AMD outsources its fabrication to TSMC.

&gt; While AMD is the designer of chips (not the manufacturer)

Wrong, AMD are the manufacturer, They outsource the silicon fabrication to TSMC, AMD then builds the CPU package with the substraight, socket, chipset.

&gt; the question I am raising is how valuable are design services for a product that has severe manufacturing issues?

There isnt a manufacturing issue, there is a demand issue. As AMD stated in their last earnings call, they over doubled their sales YoY souly because of the pandemic. No one was prepared for the pandemic to hit like it did. So stock quickly dried up, and no one can make silicon fast enough.

And AMD dont just ""design"" the products, AMD invent, design, manufacture, sell, innovate. 

Little history, If it wasnt for a little company called AMD back in 1980, we wouldnt have the CPUs, GPUs, APUs we have today. AMD started out by stealing intels designs and remaking them with better faster features. It wasnt until later in their competition, AMD and intel would actually partner up and design x86 which is what makes it possible for the modern world to run.

So the value is in a Founding company of the x86 ecosystem who is constantly pushing innovation and designing exotic and faster processing methods.


If you wan to short anyone, short intel, Intel has become stagnent, complacient,  flaccid, and stuck in the past.

Im not spreading fud, i dont work for a hedge fund, you can look at my account. its old, and ive been posting on WSB for 15+ months, i started back in the original march 2020 crash. I was very pro GME/AMC back in jan, and over time my tune has changed, as ive watched this subreddit change.

Its obvious these tickers dont fit the WSB style, theres no TA, or real fundamental reason to trade these. Its beyond obvious they're manipulated up by other HFs, government entities, and being spammed up. The option chain is BTFO, and everyone is preaching ""shares shares shares"" which anyone who spent 5 minutes on WSB 8 months ago would laugh at in terms of ""wsb style trading"" 

Theres nothing natural about the moves in these tickers, theres no fundamentals, TA, or astrology to support the craziness we see, at least stupid trades like  short dated calls/puts on purple mattress, TSLA, oil futures, MGM,BA, AMD made some sort of sense. its obvious these memes have become similar to a certain asset that is also banned from being talked about on WSB for similar pump/dump&amp;manipulation reasons.

I guess for background, I‚Äôm 24 and a half, just finished grad school in stats, and I‚Äôm making $65k/year (living with my parents rn but will be moving back to the RTP for work in late July). Before taxes, every two weeks I‚Äôll be making about $2700. Thank god I have no debt (love my parents so much ‚ù§Ô∏è), but my current portfolio is this:

100 shares of CRSP
15 shares of AMC
10 shares of WISH
10 shares of CLOV

The 100 shares of CRSP I really don‚Äôt want to touch. I originally had 50 shares of MSFT at around $245 at its peak (then), sold it all for GME, diamond handed it, and then sold it for a slight loss at $90/share (bought in around $94/share). Used that money to buy CRSP because I felt like an idiot with my GME purchase, thinking it wouldn‚Äôt ever spike again. Also, like an idiot, while I was still living with my parents back home in Ohio, I was still on my lease back in NC and gambled $2500 (about 6 months worth of rent) in the market as well and lost about $1900 leaving me with just south of 2 months worth of rent. 

I‚Äôve learned my lessons for sure, and I‚Äôm happy that I put money into CLOV and WISH yesterday, and I‚Äôm optimistic about AMC, but my goal is 

100 shares of BEAM, 
100 shares of FATE, 
100 shares of NTLA, 
25 shares of NVDA, 
25 shares of TSLA, 
50 shares of AMD, 
50 shares of AAPL, 
50 shares of MSFT, and 
50 shares of AI. 

That said, I really want to get into purchasing calls, I just don‚Äôt really know how to. I use TD Ameritrade and I just want to make sure I‚Äôm doing it right and be super careful. I definitely have opinions about what prices certain stocks will be at by some time point I think, I just don‚Äôt know how to trade calls on those. I also don‚Äôt really know what ‚Äútheta‚Äù is so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not in the options game. I see so many people making big bucks off it though.

If I may add (I've written about the SEMI CAPS):

\-They all have scary looking charts because these companies continue to buy back their stock and earn money.  ASML (the Dutch company the author mentioned) is a literal monopoly with 90% market share in the most advanced lithography tools.  Each one costs over 150M which is much more expensive than even a 737 (90M).  

LRCX/AMAT/KLAC are three companies that people should be buying over AMD/NVDA/TSMC right now.  They will continue to go up and in a few months you can then pick up leaps on AMD/NVDA who will be able to collect OBSCENE cash when they can get all the chips they need manufactured.  

Imagine 2 years from now when Nvidia can actually sell as many chips as people want and it costs them less because all the foundries invested BILLIONS in paying LRCX and friends to help them make more chips.  

&amp;#x200B;

The chip shortage is a bad thing. They may have sold a lot of their old stock, but they haven't been able to make new stock.

If you head over to thetagang, hundreds of people selling CCs when amc was in the $11-14 range got all their stock assigned and didn't make any profit past amc going over $14+. We need to avoid this at all costs.

As for other stocks i plan on wheeling a few tickers such as amd, msft, fb and dkng after amc is done with.

They're both after Intel's lunch really. The risk here being how well companies trying to push for their own designs / architectures will do (Apple's M1 series, Google's, Amazon's and BABA's proprietary designs etc.).

115,2021-07-01,"AMD shareholders have agreed to acquire XLNX. Instead of paying with cash, they are acquiring the company entirely through stock. The two parties have agreed to a fixed ratio of 1:1.72 to do so. Meaning for every one share of XLNX owned you will receive 1.72 ish shares of AMD. Only if all necessary regulatory bodies approve the acquisition. Currently China is the last approval required until the merger can occur. Technically China can say no and AMD will most likely decide to not go on with the merger.

Because the acquisition is a fixed rate of shares. OP is staring at current market prices the value of one share of XLNX currently is cheaper than 1.72 shares of AMD creating a small discount.

While some WBS picks have done well, I think the ""smart money"" is figuring out how to whittle away at retail investors wallets, and Theta Gang loves this sub. Saw a guy on their sub yesterday claiming to have made almost $200k YTD selling calls to WBS apes.

Once a ticker is in the top 3 statistics seem to be working against it, AMD did aight though. Oh yeah, and stop picking shit tickers just because they have short interest. Maybe they're shorted for a reason.

14,2021-07-02,I was riding some AMD from feb to april with no gains and sold it off to buy nvidia and AMC. I understand the hesitation.   Intel is the only other game in town for x86 compute and they still have deeper pockets and a bigger R&amp;D budget than AMD but on the other hand AMD can stay in second place but double their sales by going from 15% market share to 30% market share. They have already won over the hearts and minds of the enthusiast/gamer market with their last two generations of chips and if intel can't get it together and match the performance of AMD's new server chips the big boys that buy millions of dollars of chips at a time for server center deployment are going to follow the gamers out there and leave intel in the dust.

27,2021-07-02,"Just do some basic analysis. The price was sitting at \~10 dollars for a while, and then shot up to 50 dollars. That's a 500% increase. Every 1 dollar it moves, you make about 400 dollars. The thing about stocks though is increases are exponential, not linear. In other words, to move 500% from 10 to 50 took about 20 billion dollars, but to move 500% again, it would take 225 billion dollars. That means the likelyhood of this happening is very low. Remember, prices are not objective markers in space. GME going to 500 dollars did not even take 100 billion, it was only valued around 60 at that price and it only lasted for a few seconds. 

If you honestly think a struggling movie company that was on the decline even before Covid is going to be worth more than AMD, a successful processor manufacture who is helping massive corporations like Google and Amazon shape the modern world, then by all means, stay in for the return. But realistically how much more do you think you are going to get out of this? You made 20 grand. To get another 20 grand you need to risk probably losing at least 15 grand over time minimum. You can put a stop loss and let it ride but that has it's own associated risk. You can also do as other suggest here and sell calls against these but that also has a downside risk. 

You can try to eek out a few extra thousand by selling to close at a different strike and turning it into a fixed trade, where you stand to for example make an extra xxxk but also lose that much and no matter what you secure some amount of it, but honestly because you are here asking this question in the first place

24,2021-07-03,"Read the DD and pick a legitimate company you believe in. Take CLOV or CLNE for example.

That's probably thinking in years worth of time though. However, if you fell for some instant short squeeze moon 600% in one day hypothesis then you became a sucker. It's possible for someone who invests in a company to be smart and another dumb as rocks with the exact same company. 

For example: I made 150% gains on AMD calls over the past couple weeks. I read the DD that their acquisition would be approved in the EU and agreed that it would cause the stock to increase in price. AMD also is a solid company that sells a product that I use and am extremely happy with so the decision was easy. Another one was SPCE announcing Branson would go to space before Bezos. People did research and found the hotel was booked at a certain date. That announcement made the stock gain in price. Missed out on that one cause I waited a day too long.

41,2021-07-06,"the shortage issues massively massively hurt AMD. Without it, it would have shown higher YoY growth and faster marketshare growth in datacentre/HPC. Its fucked AMD a lot. We could have been 105 now instead of 95. TSMC expansion in the US along with Intels drive to expand into foundry leaves a lot of possibilities for AMD. Its not super clear that its a slam dunk win for AMD. Its more moving parts in the future whereas we prefer less moving parts with current competitive advantage.

NVDA is kicking AMD's ass inside out on GPU and hardware acceleration in datacentre/AI. We just have to accept it as it is. NVDA is something you should also look to get into when the price isnt so stupid. AMD is not NVDA though. Dont expect those price levels. NVDA has a fucking stranglehold in market sectors that AMD does not have.

AMD is however takings Intel's lunchmoney on x86 and its mainly because Intel fucked up on EUV. Intel's comments on ""chiplets glued together""? Well those chiplets glued together are what allow AMD to make much better yields on smaller die sizes. When a wafer has an issue, you lose a lower portion of the wafer if you have smaller dies, or chiplets. So now AMD has several years lead on making chiplet designs talk to eachother faster or more efficiently.

Intel is however throwing in the towel and going to pay for EUV by TSMC in 2023. AMD has advance plans for 2023 with TSMC anyway and think they are second customer behind Apple so should be on a more even playing field moving forward in 2023, with the advantage of maybe 5 years with infinity fabric and chiplet design instead of monolithic dies. However if EUV pellicles come good by then, monolithic dies may be better - cant tell.

by making less profit than intel and nvidia, though this year they are probably beating intel outright since intel's chips are generally crap.

I think 2022-2023 will be when shit hits the fan. If AMD is still making huge gains in performance and slide past nvidia at that point I think AMD will do more than just grow, they'll take over the market, but I don't think its as obvious as people think it is. AMD is winning big thanks to intel failing miserably on 10nm, giving TSMC almost half a decade to pass them. They're not really winning against nvidia since they went with TSMC for performance but they can barely deliver gpus.

While NVidia sometimes puts their boot up their asshole wrt drivers, they generally just tickle the ring whereas AMD started with the booth firmly ensconced in the lower intestine and have been struggling to remove it. They have improved, but are still a ways behind.

Their CPUs are really good right now and Intel are floundering. That said they are still hampered because most current software isn't very good at multi threading so single core performance is important, especially for gaming, and Intel are competitive there. They are eating Intel in data centers though.

The big thing for me is that AMD have a runway - theyre still behind but have better CPUs and the data centre uptake is very bullish. Supply could become an issue here, because the big data centre players won't want to wait or to overpay. But assuming adequate supply there should be noticeable growth in the data center side, and of course GPU supply constraints mean that they will continue to sell as many as they make.",QuestionablySensible,wallstreetbets,56.0

127,2021-07-05,"$AMD is easily my fav stock and I'm bullish long term however there's a lot of catalysts that will have effects on $AMD both negative and positive. I'm not passing this on as financial advice, just my opinions:

**Chip Shortage**

\- This one is the most obvious. In many cases it helps the bullish argument since $AMD (and [also $NVDA](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/nvda/earnings) but fuckem) continues to exceed earnings estimates despite the rough environment. The [expansion of $TSMC into America](https://www.reuters.com/technology/tsmc-says-construction-has-started-arizona-chip-factory-2021-06-01/), in my opinion, is going to launch $AMD into the fuckin' stratosphere over the next couple of years. 

Being the massive pussy that I am though, I'm concerned about how an impending crash will impact the supply and demand of semiconductor chips, [which computing technology consumes about 1/3 of](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/semiconductors/devices/how-and-when-the-chip-shortage-will-end-in-4-charts).

**$NVDA Stock Split**

Fuckin' $NVDA... always raining on the $AMD parade. I'm not angry just disappointed. This stock split is actually pretty insignificant. I expect the price of $NVDA post-split (1:4) to be somewhere between $150 and $250 just based on previous prices and my exceptional arithmetic skills. While this is still above $AMD stock price, I think it will be easier to compare the two tickers compared to $AMD $95 and $NVDA $800. 

**Innovation**

I'm an avid PC gamer. I literally have nothing going on other than my Steam account and my Fidelity account. This is (not) a cry for help.  IMO, $NVDA has the best net technology for GPUs. However $AMD offers more consumer-friendly products. I believe that $AMD cards offer the best value per dollar paid. (Unless you're one of those idiots paying 5 grand for a graphics card. I mean cmon, you can watch Pornhub Premium without an RTX 3080.) This catalyst is just going to be driven by overall consumer sentiment. If people begin realizing that their value is better spent on $AMD graphics cards, that [market share](https://www.statista.com/statistics/754557/worldwide-gpu-shipments-market-share-by-vendor/) is gonna be gobbled the fuck up. Oh and processers? Yeah, $INTC is a piece of shit that I'm not concerned with. No source just facts. 

**Price Outlook**

If I was Michael Burry and had enough coke and psilocybin I would tell you guys the price target a year from now. But I'm a broke college student with no coke and barely enough psilo, so it's whatever. 

\- Short term I'm, playing AMD calls pretty close to the chest. Currently holding 7/9 $95c and 8/20 $100c. I roll up or down depending on how the week has gone. For a quick swing I try to enter in anywhere under $85.

\- Mid-term? I don't fucking know, get back to me if the market crashes. If not, 6-12months out, $100-$120 with a floor around $85-$90 just based on how we've been growing and the fact that resistance-&gt;support.

\- Long term, $NVDA levels. I believe with all my heart that $AMD is the better company and should be valued as such. They are a company that continues to exceed expectations and make great connections in the computing industry. For shares I would just buy and hodl until I retire. No selling on the dips.

also, 10% better? i saw in the video you shared that they are very similar, in some games amd wins in other intel wins, i would even say its even.

Kudos to NVidia for not slacking off when no competition was in sight, but quite simply we don't know what's going to happen when real competition enters the data center space. It hasn't happened before, so we don't have a lot of data to work with. A lot of the deployments are new, running new software, not upgrading legacy x86 systems.

107,2021-07-06,"i love $AMD, however comparing them to NVDA is not the right move. NVDA is a different beast in that they have the growth of AMD while having the stellar gross margins. Investors are willing to pay a premium for NVDA because of how stellar they are in printing cash and profits. That being said, AMD deserves to be priced closer to NVDA than Intel. I do not believe AMD and Su Bae are focused on catching NVDA, and are more concerned with taking market share from and crushing Intel. All the DDs written on here continue to ignore how important the Xilinx merger is. It was hated on by many, but Su Bae is no moron, she is strongly positioning AMD to dominate the CPU and Semi-Custom solutions. AMD will continue to make progress in the GPU and gaming market but the growth and tendies will come from expanding further into and dominating the server industry and building strong relationships that will establish profits for years, as well as expansion into 5g, aerospace and defense, and AI.",stevoacp1,wallstreetbets,107.0

I remember back when smartphone sales were teetering and semiconductors were having issues... tech everywhere was starting to miss earnings numbers... that was Feb 2018... I told myself to wait rather than buy puts. I held my AMD and finally bailed out in the summer at $30. Then it all gave out in the fall, with favourites like AMD, NVDA, AAPL and others getting hit. It was months of damage and chaos, and then very early in 2019 everything started to rocket higher again.

He very well may be correct about this stuff, but maybe the market takes until Feb of next year to digest it and panic? The same thing happened in 2007... all the bad economic data didn't crash things until part way into 2008! Burry was well over a year early back then, which was painful. He and the OP may be correct, but timing a crash is tricky. Most investors don't have a clue about this stuff, so it won't cause them to sell. They'll probably just buy the dip.

Most of their revenue consistently comes from datacenter activity. You are going to see a slight decline in total sales of GPU's as the china farms offload their inventory but the impact on NVIDIA share price will be disproportionate to the decline in GPU sales.,TruthHurts236911,wallstreetbets,52.0

8,2021-07-10,"Earnings impact is something I watched quite closely for 3 years now. There is no way you could play earnings reliable and it is should be common knowledge.

I have broken down entire earnings calls and there is no tangible correlation between price performance with earnings performance. Even though a company may miss earnings targets the price can still perform well because the CEO showed promise. And this goes the other way too, when earnings targets is beaten but the CEO failed to show promise. 

This is the case particularly with retailers and clothing brands where even though earnings target was not beaten however they showed promise in online presence and their price went up in the subsequent days. If you look at TSLA you will also see that even though they might have beaten earnings target their prices for some weird reason will always fall. But that doesn't mean this is a pattern.

Playing earnings is difficult and there is no sure-fire way to win. Except for that one guy in WSB who always plays AMD earnings and wins. Then the theory becomes you have to pick one stock to play earnings and you have to be extremely knowledgeable about the company and the data.

Cries in AMD",spreadsTrader,wallstreetbets,36.0
37,2021-07-11,"Here‚Äôs my take on this syndrome. 

The bag holding of losses wouldn‚Äôt be so real if it didn‚Äôt work so well sometimes. I bought AMD at like 93 and had a fat loss on it within days. Ended up just holding it for a few months and recently it made it back up. Never been so happy with a $140 gain in my life. LOL!

On SPY I used to do the same thing. ‚ÄúTake the gain, then miss the train.‚Äù 
I‚Äôve started training myself to buy 100 share lots of everything so that when I‚Äôm nervous about it reversing my second option (see what I did there?) to selling is to buy a slightly OTM put instead and see how it goes. I‚Äôll lose a little if it goes sideways but if it‚Äôs up I‚Äôm happy to pay the insurance since I‚Äôm gaining on the shares and if it‚Äôs down then I feel great and if it crashes I feel like a genius. I‚Äôve been thinking this weekend about doing that for DIA, SPY, and QQQ going into Tuesday‚Äôs CPI and bank earnings. I don‚Äôt want to sell, but I don‚Äôt feel super comfy next week. You‚Äôre talking SPY options so holding the shares may or may not be an option. (Hah, that‚Äôs twice)

I‚Äôd like to add a third dimension to this, the ‚Äúwhy am I terrible at buying in March/April 2020 and riding high on v shaped recoveries? Twice now I‚Äôve witnessed a massive drop in the market and stood there terrified with my cash in hand. I‚Äôm still working on that one.

Microsoft and Sony chose them for consoles because it keeps the cost down. An Intel/Nvidia combo would school anything AMD has currently, and we'd pay for it.

Your stock picks and play are shit, and do not ""Do your part"" since this is not an organized group and almost everyone is here to make money for themselves and only themselves, and so should you.

If you want to make money do not put your money in any of the ""hot stocks"" since your risk of ruin is pretty massive, though if you are a degenerate gambler who wants to treat Wallstreet as a Casino go ahead maybe you'll be right this week. Safe and Stable that will make you money are companies and funds like SPY, MSFT, and AAPL. High Risk and Volatile that may have higher returns are like ROKU, TSLA, and AMD. 

HOOD is not going to die/continue to go down since every retard on WSB and new investor is basically still using their platform. If you try to short it at open I guarantee you will have your asshole ripped open wider than a goatsie picture if you hold that position for more than a couple days since your only option would be to short sell it, aka what hedgefunds did before getting gaped for $4bil on GME. There is a lot of buy pressure behind the company so I wouldn't be surprised if it goes above IPO price within a month and higher by EOY.

It‚Äôs about how everyone feels about it. Look at AMC and GME. You‚Äôre gonna laugh now because it‚Äôs not gonna make sense, but the reality is that there‚Äôs a Lot of companies that are overvalued right now, but as a technology company AMD is moving. The movement down was purely to do with the lack of resources, the bullish price is based on the company‚Äôs potential, not just on current revenue.

65,2021-08-01,"It‚Äôs about the technical analysis, how are you so sure the 100$ price mark that it hit was not priced in already? Other than the Xilinx hype which is cool and all, will occur only near the EOY, not to mention that the higher price AMD hits, the lesser value of a deal Xilinx will be getting according to the pre-existing deal they have already for XX% of amd shares for stake in Xilinx. 

What I want to ask is that is AMD really correctly priced in when Q1‚Äôs Revenue was 3.45B priced in at 85.41$ EOD,
Now Q2 hits at 3.85B revenue with an EPS boost of 0.09$ it should be hitting higher highs than 106$? That‚Äôs 20B+ in valuation over 1 Quarterly earning with an unfinished acquisition of Xilinx. And you‚Äôre here to tell me I‚Äôm overlooking that 1M volume worth of bullish trades on Friday?

Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love AMD to death, but I‚Äôm just being realistic that the price point is way overvalued for the earnings that had occurred.

Not to mention AMD went downtrend all the way to 73.09$ in May(after Q1 report), breaking yearly ATL @ 74$ in March.

3,2021-08-03,"It's really interesting reading these comments. I'm bullish long term on AMD and think the run could continue for a few days or so more, but it WILL come down some time within the next week or so... possible as low as the mid-90s. AMD's runs generally last about 2 weeks. This one's a little more abrupt and it could create a new floor level in the low-100s for a bit, but the thing people need to understand is that the key to keeping this going is volume, and day over day the volume is dropping since 3 days ago.

RSI is returning to the center channel from the top for a couple of days. During the first 3 days of the run, AMD was keeping volume up with NASDAQ and today is dipped into a relative downward volume trend compared to the index, meaning that attention is shifting from the stock. Institutions will sell as retail investors continue to buy on hopium.

I feel that hopium, I do... I wrote that TA 2 weeks ago that called for this run based on shape, dynamics, and momentum and I got exactly what I wanted and then some, and I want that run to continue, but the run started at around $85 about 2 weeks ago and had a 20 point expected duration based on the pattern, which I think was driven forward through sentiment on earnings and that could extend it a bit, but by how much?

Watch the volume tomorrow... that's going to tell the tale. If it starts to drop, the price can't be supported, and there'll be a sell-off.",Moist_Lunch_5075,wallstreetbets,3.0
4,2021-08-03,"I did the opposite..

I had like 2-3yr work exp in a tech firm. My backgrnd is CS (Mostly HW Engineering). I had my eye on Intel and AMD. Have been building PCs since my school days. Used to read Anandtech, Toms Hardware, Linus etc almost daily back from 2013.

I knew at some point Ryzen chips started gaining attention. Almost all articles were citing it as groundbreaking and 1st time nearing Intel's performance. I started with $1000 bucks when AMd was at $2, Sold at $4. Then again entered when AMD was at $6 and sold at $9.

Meanwhile I used to recommend this stock to my Boss, Friends, Relatives, Almost everyone and most laughed off at me. Yea life sucks. Anyways in 2017 when AMD was at $13-$14 I gathered majority of my savings, Took some margin and got 4500 shares (Almost $50K).

I havnt sold a single share and sitting on almost $500K. 

There were crashes like the Oct to Dec 2018 selloff when AMD dropped to $9 and I had a margin call, had to immediately transfer funds to avoid selloff. I just held on somehow.

In hindsight I dont regret my decision. Patience is a virtue and thats what I have learnt from holding AMD stock.

Yeah, and just 2 years ago, what was it's comparative size. Also what was Nvidia's comparative size? What is Nvidia's size now. How does AMD's product stack against Nvidia and how does Intel's? What was Raj able to acomplish at AMD versus Nvidia, compared to what AMD is doing now with RDNA2/3 against Nvidia? 

If you do some random pure technical analysis you can come up with whatever thesis you want for these companies being overvalued, but if you actually consider these companies more than price action you have to actually answer the question what is Intels answer to matrix multiplication accelerators and if it is their Xe garbage, how is that going to hope to compete against Nvidia Teslas or amd's pro series? With the added cash, AMD can now hope to create an actual reasonable competitor to cuda.

They didn't care about HPC because they didn't see any competition in it. Almost all of the money and research was poured elsewhere because everybody went to them for HPC anyway. Once Ryzen was released, which had obvious buy signals about it at the time, they still didn't give a shit, because first gen wasn't as good as Intels established product. 

Then it got better.

Then it got even better.

Sure you could think about ""what if I had AMD shares right now"" but the fact is that even if XLNX remains stagnant and AMD goes up, you will make more money. If anything, you should buy more XLNX since the current XLNX/AMD ratio is 1.2.

139,2021-08-04,"Good analysis. A few slight clarifications:

&gt; They acquired Xilinx so they are well positioned to kill it in the ARM server market

XLNX makes FPGAs, not ARM server chips. FPGAs do lots of different thing (they can and will be used in servers but they are so much more). And they bring a deep software engineering bench that AMD has often lacked over the years, so the tie up ought to work out well along several lines. 

&gt; now that TSMC is being used by Intel, Apple, AMD, and anyone who needs 5nm, it may be difficult to keep up with demand until the new TSMC fabs come online

Apple will always get first crack at the new stuff because they essentially pay TSMC a premium for it and subsidize its R&amp;D for the newest nodes. Intel has announced a need to turn to TSMC for fabrication of at least some of its leading edge chips, due to its own technical problems. 

However, between AMD and Intel, AMD will be given preference. The reason is simple. Intel has declared open warfare on TSMC with the announcement of its ‚ÄúIDM 2.0‚Äù initiative, which aims to open Intel‚Äôs fabrication facilities to third parties ‚Äî essentially, they want to take a chunk of TSMC‚Äôs foundry business. As a result, while TSMC will supply Intel to a reasonable extent, they will almost certainly give AMD preference over Intel, as a way to check Intel‚Äôs ambitions. 

In other words, TSMC says if you want to cut into our core business (foundry), we will enable AMD to cut into your core business (x86 server and laptop CPUs) by making sure they have whatever they need on the fabrication side of things.",Maximus_Aurelius,wallstreetbets,139.0

204,2021-08-04,"that's what intel is going for. Integrating 14nm+++ architectures with 10nm try to only use 10nm for the parts that actually benefit from it.

btw, on your original question: you expect a certain error rate per unit of area on your fabrication process. Bigger the ASIC, the higher the probability a single chip has a mistake.

Depending on the mistake you could potentially reserve that piece as a lower performing part by disabling the part of the chip with an error.  As you mentioned.

What you can't do is disable it for the high-end parts. The high-end chips, the i9s the 3090s, these are A++ parts. Often in the largest die that is feasible. Feasibility comes from yield. How many fully working chips come out of a wafer given a chip size.   Most of the production cost is per wafer processed, so you want to balance the number of chips you can get out of a single wafer and how much you can sell each one of these chips in that wafer for.

Then there are other market considerations, companies will never drop their flagship price too much even if they have the yield, just because they can make a larger margin on those parts.  Often you see mid-range chips that would be capable of  operating as a more expensive part but were hardware locked cause the company rather do that than to drop the price of the higher tier part.

Anyway, long story short: AMD gets a higher yield by making smaller chipsets which have a higher chance of being a higher end part (instead of a mammoth one with lower yield). They then have to pay the manufacturing step of actually getting these chiplets working together.  You'd think that post processing is expensive, but given the price of a single wafer at the smallest node in TSMC, they're better off with that strategy.

They acquired Xilinx so they are well positioned to kill it in the ARM server market

AMD powers both PS5 and XBox X, and will be powering the steam deck, which means game designers will be optimizing for AMD hardware heavily which could break Nvidia‚Äôs longtime leadership in GPU hardware.

Su Bae is dumping tons of money into R&amp;D while maintaining or gaining leadership in nearly every performance metric and use case, not resting on their position like Intel did post Skylake. 

Tesla is using AMD power as well for their vehicles, so the infotainment/set driving vehicle space seems up for grabs. 

The only downsides or questions hanging have to do with Fabrication- now that TSMC is being used by Intel, Apple, AMD, and anyone who needs 5nm, it may be difficult to keep up with demand until the new TSMC fabs come online.

I spent a few months researching their chips (because I was buying a gaming comp) and how they compare to Nvidia-not everyone can afford or needs Nvidia chips.  
AMD blasted earnings and will again next earnings call. They are also providing the chips for Apples new MacBook: AMD Radeon PRO W6000X series GPUs for Apple Inc.‚Äôs (NASDAQ:AAPL) Mac Pro desktop computers.

They will acquire Xilinx and that provides them with FPGA (field-programmable gate arrays), which are particularly useful for telecommunications applications, and the development of 5G across the world. FPGAs allow for Data Center clients, higher capacity with more end user maneuverability. They also are smaller, require less energy and therefore less need for thermal control.

Overall once the get Xilinx they will have opportunities in the areas Xilinx already has a share in. Such as embedded systems within the automotive, aerospace, and defense sectors.

Also most will just post memes or witty comments. But I'll throw in some suggestions on tax:

1. You should plan to exercise ***some*** of those options. Especially if those are under 1 year. Because you'll be taxed at Short-Term capital gains rather than LT cap gains which is lower (assuming you're in the US). 

2. When you exercise your calls you don't pay taxes because you're just buying at a lower price. In fact, it reduces your taxable amount because you paid out premium. This wouldn't work if you bought some shit meme stock but you bought AMD which is a company you can probably hold a year or longer without issue. (This is what DFV did with his GME options)

3. You can follow the suggestions of your fellow apes and try ~~losing it all~~ rolling the dice one more time before the end of the year.

4. You can reduce your taxes with IRA/401k on your wages, donations to causes you like (it's underrated you'll get perks, good IRL karma, you can post about it on reddit if you adopt some apes for internet karma, or just feel good about it), and finally you can just pay your fair share to the tax man.

Fact 4: SPY Calls with 6-10 week expiry are safe as fuck 

Fact 5:  Fact 3 + Fact 4 proves doubling up with calls that have 6-10 weeks expiry is easy and safe (as fuck)

Thesis: SPY will experience pull backs before rocketing back up to new ATHs


Strategy: 

Step 1: Buy slightly OTM SPY Calls that are 6-10 weeks out with 50% of cash on any 1% down day. 

Step 1a: Average down those Calls with another 50% of remaining cash if there is a second down day. 

Step 1c: Average down those Calls with 100% of remaining cash if there is a third down day. 

Step 2: HODL until Calls double in value. 

Step 3: Sell 70% of Calls. 

Step 4: HODL until Calls are up another 30% (2.3x return total) or sell if goes to only up 90%. 

Step 5: Rinse and repeat

Note: Make sure your calls are never less than 1 month away from expiry. (roll them forward) 

Fact 6: I will be a (one) millionaire again in roughly 3-4 months.

347,2021-08-04,"Hypothetically if you were making chips, you start with one gigantic wafer of silicon, and you ""cut"" pieces of it off , these pieces are then analyzed and tested to see how much of the circuitry inside the wafer is usable, if the whole wafer is usable this will be used to create one high end sku,  if only half of it is usable then it might be used to make one mid range sku, and so on. This is the traditional monolithic way of doing things. Now with MCM design (multi chip module) let's say you need to fulfill inventory of a high end sku but you only have a bunch of pieces of silicon that can make mid range sku's, now all you have to do in an oversimplified nutshell is take 2 or 3 of those mid range wafers and connect them together, they'll act as one high end wafer. Which man's you didn't have to throw away silicon at a lower end and lower profit margin component.


Edit: the process I describe here is called chip binning and the way AMD bins their chips they have far greater flexibility to create higher end components using multiple mid end components. Generally speaking the highest end components are exempt from this process as it usually requires the full silicon wafer to be functional but this opens the door to drastically increase yields for everything beneath the highest end sku's.",matrixzone5,wallstreetbets,347.0

If you've been following me, I've been advocating AMD for a long time and put a $50k yolo down on the stock. Those that listened to me, grats. We made some serious tendies.

But this run isn't going to last forever. Right now, I believe Arbitragers are being forced to close out their short positions with AMD due to liquidity risk. 

I explain Arbitrage in more detail here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n4r47g/amd\_an\_explanation\_on\_merger\_arbitrage\_and\_how\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n4r47g/amd_an_explanation_on_merger_arbitrage_and_how_to/)

Basically, in this all-stock fixed ratio acquisition, the arbitrage play is to short AMD and buy Xilinx, then close positions when the deal is closed. However, they're not able to get to that point because AMD is up so much. Which means they have to close AMD short positions now and sell Xilinx to cover the costs.

A share dilution would happen if a company made a stock offering to for example shore up debt because that wouldn't increase the company's earnings and therefore your earnings per share would decrease. This is not the case here because AMD is essentially acquiring the earnings by Xilinx. 

If AMD had issued 100 shares and had earnings of $100, then acquired Xilinx whose earnings are $50, issuing 50 shares to Xilinx, then 150 shares would be available in the open market but in relation to earning of $150.

However, as of today, the ratio is now 1.34 after AMD dropped today and XLNX gained.

182,2021-08-05,"No, you're good. Look at it this way: Would you rather be a bagholder or have a small but noticeable profit? Also, the average market return is generally 10%-15%, and that's annually. If you're getting even a 10% return over a month or two, then you're still on the path to beating the market. 

I bought MVIS two days ago at $13.5. I held through the dip the past few days, and when it spiked today, I set a 2% trailing stop loss that triggered at $14.4. Yeah, I only made a 6.5% profit, but that's a fucking profit after two days. Maybe it'll go up to $18 again, but maybe it won't. We don't know. The market is unpredictable, and these are high risk plays with fucking meme stocks. I got in and out with a profit, and that's more than most of what the idiots on here can say.

That said, I sympathize with you. Two months ago I bought AMD at around $79, planning to hold until it hit $100. It went up to $83 and I was happy, but then it dipped back to $77 and I gave up and sold. THEN I bought again at $94 and gave up AGAIN when it dipped to $89.

197,2021-08-05,"Sure, that's definitely true.  But the idea of AMD losing value before the end of the year is... pretty unlikely, IMO.  With every quarter growing 100% or more over the year prior, it's just hard to see that happening.  And Intel has announced a ludicrous roadmap that basically says they still haven't learned their lesson and just intend to scream in the engineers faces 'go faster!'  They expect to do 5 process nodes in 2 years.  Nevermind they've never done that before (not sure anyone has), but this is while they're still scrambling with delays and coming off of failures.  And they're going to have extra difficulties because the stacked-chip design they're using is inferior to AMDs 3D V-Cache technique.  I expect best-case-scenario for them is to catch up in 2 years.  To where AMD is right now.  Which will leave them still behind because TSMCs roadmap is actually realistic and they have a proven track record of giving the engineers the time and resources they need, while Intel just loses itself in infighting and inter-departmental squabbles that marketing and business far too often win which hobbles engineering.",otakucode,wallstreetbets,197.0

If you want to narrow down the needles from the haystacks in biotech, then I‚Äôd argue that a company‚Äôs capital is just as important as their product. Moderna raised $110mm in 2013, $500mm in 2018, and was the biggest biotech IPO ever raising $600mm. This money meant they could hire better researchers, invest in state of the art software and facilities, and overall get to market quicker than anyone else.

As soon as they announced they were developing a COVID vaccine, I figured there‚Äôd be a high probability they‚Äôd come out top 3, if not on top. 

FWIW, I actually think they have a lot more room  to grow - both with expanding their existing covid vaccine and its boosters in other countries, as well as developing new MRNA vaccines for other viruses.

70,2021-08-06,"I‚Äôve watched that exact scenario play out with a whole pile of stocks the past two months. I watch every day. At this point I can look at open interest on call/put options most weeks and get a good sense of where the stock will end up. 
With AMD yesterday I sold my $122 call when it ran past $120 and pulled back. Seemed we had hit a band of resistance and the next day would see the fallback. But FOMO might take hold once again if it has a good Monday/Tuesday. 

When we‚Äôre on a downtrend, we seem to always fight for, but end below the strike with a significant number of call open interest. This trend reverses when the fight ends on the top side of the call strike. Suddenly the top of the Gaussian distribution peak of call option open interest ends up ITM, and then those shares must be found and delivered next Tuesday - when the stock is sold short, this seems to often result in a pump the following Tuesday as shares are bought to deliver for ITM options. 
This is especially true on monthly option expirations. 
When this happens in conjunction with increased retail interest and technical chart patterns that look bullish (hence retail jumps in), we see the start of the meme runs again as it begins to have a snowballing affect.",ChemaKyle,wallstreetbets,70.0

* Lost 4k on HOOD. I was actually up 4k but didn't sell the day before.

* Sold OCGN before it went on the run up. I'm conservative about using margin although I still have a ton left. I needed to free up some capital for HOOD.

51,2021-08-07,"From what I read and been researching-

AMD started to rocket early in the week, while XLNX started to drag due to worries about merger fall through. 

Because of the gap, players who did high arbitrage play by shorting AMD and buying XLNX as cover started to get margin called on their short position since XLNX could not keep up price ratio. 

This caused them to liquidate XLNX to get funds to buy AMD, causing the gap to grow and grow, and more AMD short covers which caused the big spike wed).

Now that the prices have stabilized, the arbitrage is starting up again because XLNX and AMD became very wide gapped, meaning AMD will be shorted so XLNX could be bought so it gets closer to ratio",Jamber_Jamber,wallstreetbets,51.0

WSB is extremely divided about CLOV, and that's fine.

The most I've seen is ""Chamath is a charlatan and it was done through a shady SPAC deal"" or say ""dude, just google it...it's so obvious its a P&amp;D"". It's like saying AMD is shit because Cramer likes it and promotes it (he has been since it was trading in the 20s). 

Meanwhile, the bulls are posting at least some semblance of DD. Even it it may be flawed it some parts, at least they provide good reasoning on why its has the potential for a big move.

153,2021-08-09,"I'm sure this isn't all of it so people please correct what is wrong or missing, this is just my understanding of buying calls. contract price = premium per share x 100 shares, premium = $ share has to rise for cost of contract to break even, value of contract = -$ profit until contract breaks even
Different $ premium, same contract #
Buy single contract at $2 premium(paid $200), buy another single contract for same date and call at $5 premium(paid $500). Stock goes up $1 a share. You're up $100 on each but still down overall.  -$200 + 100 = -100 on first, -$500+100= -$400 on second.
Price goes up $2 ur even/at 0 on first but -300 on second. 
Price goes up $5 ur +300 on first but just now even on second. 
Price up $10 ur +800 on first, +500 on second.

Different # contract, same premium $
Buy 2 contracts at $2 premium (2x200= paid 400) vs 5 contracts for $2 premium (5x 200= paid 1000). Stock goes up $1. Up $100 per contract. So -$400 + (100x2)= -200 or  -$1000 + (100x5) = -500.
Price goes up $2 you'd be even/at 0 on both.
Price goes up $5 
-$400 + (500x2) = 600 or -$1000 + (500x5) = +1500.
Price up $10
-$400+(1000x2)= +$1600 or -$1000 + (1000x5) = +$4000.

Only in the last few years have I earned six figures.  Just socked it away.  

I got lucky with a house that appreciated about $200K but other than that no inheritance or other big sources of income or gifts besides a few $10-$20K bonuses here and there over two decades.

I have $2.5M.  I‚Äôve played it safe the whole time.

20,2021-08-11,"That‚Äôs amazing insight. Thanks so much. I‚Äôm looking at something to buy-and-hold over the next decade that is a well positioned company and cornerstone in the industry. Of all my research, ON Semiconductor stands out as it‚Äôs position on marketshare, cash flow is very positive, and it‚Äôs an American company. 

You make an interesting point though, if purchasing orders do not flow to TSMC (say, worst case scenario Taiwan comes under the full control of the Commies) then TSMC may have the know how but it doesn‚Äôt have the markets. Can‚Äôt we bolster our own production? Take our own fab orders from INT and AMD? Can their be subsidies in this regard? I‚Äôm just pontificating. 

This is all hypothetical but IR hawks think Taiwan will increasingly come under control of China and its IP with it. So this hypothetical ‚Äúfreeze-China-out-of-the-markets‚Äù has to be orchestrated by the West. I think it will happen irrespective of its play on Taiwan. If China play by the rules and respect IP, it can‚Äôt play. Since we know chip design really well, surely the manufacturing can‚Äôt be too far behind?

It‚Äôs just so hard to bet against TSMC. They want free market competition with the West. Taiwan wants to be more aligned with the West anyway. 

I‚Äôm good at the macro part, and if I had to make a bet, I‚Äôd say we enter into some kid of quasi-Cold War with China. Biden‚Äôs taking many of the same positions Trump has taken, although he‚Äôs not calling anyone rocket man via Tweet. I remember when Rex Tillerson gave a speech in India 3 years ago stating that the US‚Äôs strategic partner in the region will be India. After all, why not? It‚Äôs the world‚Äôs largest democracy with minimal global ambitions. To some degree we share a lot of the same values. I don‚Äôt see this US-Sino marriage lasting much longer. 

I mention this because, we‚Äôre eventually going to put our chips down with China and find out who‚Äôs model of government can foster innovation and economic expansion faster. It won‚Äôt be an arms race, but it will be an innovation race in tech, space, and life sciences. We have ethical barriers, i.e. our hesitancy to use CRISPR and gene editing. But, of course I‚Äôm patriotic, I think America indistry will endure and come out on top. 

Through all of this, there are some stocks choices I invest heavily in from about 250-500k. I‚Äôve been eyeing ON Semi. I think that over time, our semiconductor industry will be competitive and way more robust and it starts with existing industries now and their position to gets subsidies from this infrastructure bill. 

Sorry for my rambling. I hope the mods don‚Äôt take it down. The micro is hard for me. The financials, management, and cash flow get difficult when comparing/contrasting competitors. 

You‚Äôve got a cool job and your on the precipice of new and innovative tech. I think that‚Äôs so cool. What‚Äôs the theory where tech will double in a certain time frame? Aren‚Äôt we witnessing the end of the reduction of size of chips? I mean at some point you‚Äôre going to hit a wall.

7,2021-08-12,"Ok so basic thesis is this

1. Fast acting dram memory is made by only 3 companies in the world. Samsung, sk hynix, and micron. There are some minor players but its pretty much an oligolopoly. While they don't have amazing tech, their memory is required for use in all computers, with more needed now than ever for ai, evs, smartphones, and servers. They are a component to a lot of products you would know of, for example the rtx 3080 uses micron memory. So micron doesn't really need to grow their business organically, the tailwinds of the industry should carry them. They also do not compete with nvidia, amd, intel, or any of the other tech companies. Their product is a supplement to the others.

2. They actually have a shit ton money, and memory is a high margin item. It is like a commodity though, and youl notice if you look through their income history how it fluctuates. It is cyclical, but always on the uptrend, and each successive peak is higher than the last and the troughs are higher as well. For every $74 stock, they have like $40 of tangible book value. That, combined with their projected earnings of 10+ on the year, with it looking like they could easily beat that for the next two make it pretty valuable imo.

Forward earnings would have them trading at 6x forward earnings. That is worse than most commodity stocks like fuckin oil and bread and whatnot. The only difference is that use of their commodity is set to explode, there is a high barrier to entry with a pretty set in stone market share. Micron has mushed p/e of $12 a share before and could easily beat that in the future regularly. 

So you get the best of both worlds, a stock that could be considered a traditional value stock, with the enormous tech tailwinds. Some hedge funds are balls deep in it too for long term holds. Li Lu has 50% of his fund, monish pabrai is at 50%, and David tepper has it as his largest holding at 9%. 50% of an entire fund is a massive bet, they're pretty confident.

edit- forgot to add, the other two memory producers are not U.S. based. If biden invests in U.S. semiconductors as a strategic initialize, they stand the best chance of taking advantage.",BobandSteve,wallstreetbets,7.0

&gt;It just seems like a task that is impossible to time.

Everything just requires timing, research, and unbelievable luck. Look at all the stocks this sub used to ""pump"" that eventually became reality. TSLA, AMD and GME. For every bullish reason a stock should be X price or more, there are people who bet against it. It's hard to get momentum started on a stock because it's easier to sell than to buy. Options indication are what institutes look for, look at what happened to HOOD when shit tons of puts were bought? Stock was basically stagnant until option trade were available, pretty obvious some institutes bought it up to make sure the puts expire worthless, then sell it. It's like iron condor, except they have the capital to make things go their way. We do not have the capital to move markets, institutes do. MB managed to time it, he had losses incurred up till the shares finally tanked. It's all about time, he ain't wrong about market being out of control.

honestly I started my own account about 6 years and turned 6k into about 60k in that time. cashed out 10k so I am happy.

current positions are AMD, TSLA, Walmart, Tilray. and recently picked up some CRSP.

TSLA i got from the solar city merge. AMD I've held since it was about 6.50 a share. Walmart I got about a year ago for the dividend. I had aphria that merged with tilray. all long plays

Timing is easy if you just buy and wait, Microsoft was flat for ten plus years when I owned it. Now my shares are worth 3000% of what I invested.  FB - buy at IPO, it tanked, wait a bit, now look at it. 

I bought AMD when everyone thought it was a gigantic piece of crap @$7 now everyone loves it...  Intel will be the next one if anyone cares to read their balance sheet. 

A pump of a single or few stocks is in no way the same as being able time or push the entire market into a freefall.  You can't explain your way into your shorts paying off, you just have to wait till the fed runs out of bullets.

3,2021-09-02,"Sell way OTM CCs on stocks you already own, so like 30 delta at most but 15 delta is safer and probably free money.  PMCC underlying should be the same criteria as if you wanted to just be long on the stock itself but the long call is cheaper than the stock so you can play on shit you couldn't afford to just buy 100 shares like AMZN, TSLA, etc.  

&amp;#x200B;

If you want a better strategy than the wheel, what I do is size my position in 200-share minimum size and then buy-write 100 shares with a CC and then a CSP for the other 100 shares, so basically a covered strangle.  Profits from both sides of the wheel, is as directional as you want it to be (but generally directional with positive delta), and captures profits from gains in the underlying instead of fucking right off with those like if you're just selling a CSP with the wheel.  If you get assigned on your CSP, then switch to just CCs.  If you get assigned on your CCs then either go back in or switch to another underlying.  I might get assigned on MARA if it keeps going up, but if so then I'll get assigned at 43 where my entry was 30 and my adjusted basis is probably closer to 25 so that's not bad for 6 weeks or so on a single position in a $10k account (actual account is closer to $35k but I'm pretending it's only $10k so I can practice this shit without blowing up my account).  This strategy ONLY works because we're in the longest bull market in history, but because of that I want to be more directional.  If we get into a crash, then chase your underlying down with CCs and roll to 50 delta every time your CCs hit like 80 delta to lock in the intrinsic in the contract for a small additional profit.  Also sell call credit spreads as it falls and buy back in at the bottom with all the premium you made during the fall.  On the way up, put credit spreads and CSPs will make you more money.  If it stays at the bottom, then condor the fuck out of it and set a limit buy like $1 below your short call so you can turn that shit into a covered call and a long call; if it drops then just take assignment on the short put if you like the stock.  


For PMCC, the good part is you can use it on stocks you can't afford so NVDA, AMD, TSLA, AAPL, MSFT (premium is shit though), FB, etc.  It's also a much more efficient use of capital than an actual CC with the stock in terms of your ROC since you can hold more positions (so trade more positions but trade smaller; read up on the Kelly Criterion for gamblers to figure out position sizing).  With 10k I'd recommend 3 positions with a maximum of maybe 4 or 5 positions at most.  With any options selling strategy, your goal is to get rich very slowly but consistently.  Aim for like 1% per week and you'll do fine.",professor_jeffjeff,wallstreetbets,3.0

8,2021-09-02,"Hmm... on the 5 day, the RSI is a bit oversold, but on the 1 month chart, it's settled down a bit more to the middle, but since the last run up it looks like this is settling down from the high RSI range average experienced before... BUT the trend we're looking at is toward the end of that, over the past week or so, so the 5 day may be a better judge of the overall trend.  


I looked at volume tracking, EMA 8/21 convergence... all indicate a very mild bearish change in direction, but could also just be an artifact of the fact that the market kind of went down at the end of the day today in general, which I kind of expect for the next couple of days, but who knows? We're in a weird time period.  


We've had a few big up days and there are some negative broader market catalysts I think we are coming and I think the MMs are going to take the opportunity to force prices down a bit and protect covered call positions... so I'm not trying to get worked up about any end of the week downward trends. I think you'll see the same thing in AMD, NVDA, etc...  


Looking at the 1 month chart, the thing that concerns me the most is actually the VWAP for GME... over the prior days during and post the run-up, VWAP's been pretty tight, but it diverges today and price action trends below the signal line, and that effect is exaggerated in some ways on the 5 day, but the 5 day also is more sensitive. The fact that it shows up on the 1m chart to me suggests a change in trend to the bearish side, but I think like I said above it may be a broader market consideration not anything specific to GME. So I'd take it with a grain of salt.",Moist_Lunch_5075,wallstreetbets,8.0

Iam a student and worked part time + invested ‚Äûsmartly‚Äú (yeah, sounds so weird right..) to bring my portfolio up to 12k last week, this was my highest so far and very impressive for me, because i will have to payback my student-loan next year which will be around 8-10k‚Ç¨. 

Now its ‚Äûall‚Äú gone, iam down 5.5k‚Ç¨ and thats all i have, i dont know what to do anymore. I cant focus on anything else, iam struggling to breath. 

What should i do? Iam suspecting that it will go up today slightly and then maybe sell. I think the AMD stock will definitely go up but my issue is the time limit i have.

Thanks in advance.",ICEMAN_ZIDANE,wallstreetbets,4.0

A lot of investors expect AMD to win those contracts when they come up for renewal. Will that happen? Who knows. A lot of US govt. contracts are still being renewed with intel because intel manufacters their chips in the US.

I personally don‚Äôt see AMD as over-priced for its potential, but I do believe most of its potential is now priced-in unless a major positive event occurs. I see more downside risk in the event intel makes a breakthrough (although that is highly unlikely for awhile) or a negative event occurs. 

Regardless, AMD‚Äôs run up is backed by fundamentals and reasonable expectations. There are definitely major downside risks since it has a P/E of almost 40, but it can definitely grow into that P/E if it continues its current trajectory. The biggest problem with AMD is their value isn‚Äôt primary driven by its own performance, but the poor performance of its competitor, which makes the investment a bit risky.",Overhaul2977,wallstreetbets,35.0

Your logic is good in a long term investing plan. 

This forum is a hour/daily based investors, evaluations is the last thing people here will follow.

Just as example, they invest in a failed tourism company in the beginning of pandemic and most of them won lots of cash. And they will keep a obvious garbage company just because, even if it goes to zero.

If you‚Äôre a long term investor this is a good place to get daily news but never, really never, follow a advice. Except mine of course :)

The stock market cares about future growth, not too much on past performance.

To give you a basic idea of investing, there are four types of companies - Dogs, Cash Cows, Question Marks, and Stars. AMD is at the Question Mark phase that is almost to Star.

55,2021-09-03,"It takes years of daily study. When I was coming up on 2 years I heard a veteran trader ask another guy how long he had been trading. The guy said 2 years. The veteran trader said, ‚Äúoh ok, he‚Äôs still a rookie.‚Äù

The key is (and it‚Äôs no key), that the biggest funds have upward of 90 billion in assets under management. They control the movements in stock price; but with so much capital, the only way they can manage it is to trade on macroeconomic headlines, with a ton of hedging, all through the use of algos. It protects them, but it causes the markets to move in the most irrational ways.

One sector is hot for a couple of weeks and then drops 10-30% for seemingly no reason. It‚Äôs fools gold to chase the trends. You‚Äôll end up being a bag holder over and over again. Capitalizing on the irrationality is where I find success. 

I have learned to trust my instincts and just let the whales come to me. When they slammed AAPL down after the best ER ever‚ÄîI bought and waited. When they did the same thing to AMD‚ÄîI bought and waited. 

Now they have been destroying gold and silver mining companies, as a tidal wave of inflation is rolling in. Guess what I‚Äôm doing‚Ä¶

You can do it, if you keep listening to the experts and only trust what you hear from multiple experts. After some time, you‚Äôll learn enough to begin thinking, ‚ÄúI disagree with what this so called expert is saying, because of x y z.‚Äù Then you‚Äôll know you‚Äôre getting it and are on the right track.

3,2021-09-05,"The biggest misconception about the wash sale rule is that it eliminates the realized loss from a write-off perspective (except in the corner case like you were talking about where people try shady things at the end of the year). If the broker is doing this correctly they will carry the loss onto the cost basis for the next buy, so it's considered part of what you paid for the stock. Let's say you buy 10 shares of AMD and then it goes down $3 a share and you sell, you've lost $30... then 2 days later you buy 5 shares for $105 each. The total cost basis should be $105\*5+30 = $555 rather than the $525 for the shares alone... this carries the loss forward so that it can be realized on the final of the rotational sales if you're daytrading.

I have personally seen brokers not carry the losses forward, so definitely something to check on wash sales.",Moist_Lunch_5075,wallstreetbets,3.0

27,2021-09-09,"DDR5 news might provide a pop, but they would still have to sell the memory.  I have said it over and over on CRSR posts, this chip shortage is not ending any time soon, the vast majority of people are still waiting on GPU's to upgrade anything, especially since at higher resolutions the bottleneck moves from the CPU to the GPU, you can run 4k60 on a first gen Ryzen as long as you have a GPU capable of outputting the frames.

Add to that historically the first set of chips on a new DDR is typically slower then the previous gens top tier, the fact all RAM is essentially the same since their are only 3 major manufacturers and everyone just repackages those chips, GSkill probably outbidding everyone else for ""the good chip"" at the start again *seriously did any of you even build a Ryzen system, Corsair had like 4 compatible sku's for the entire 300 series chipsets life, Gskill got all the B-die*
and the fact we don't have any real world specs to work with yet I don't know anyone chomping at the bit for the DDR5 release.

9,2021-09-12,"The problem with big bulk commodity chipset sales like those for cars, though, is that they're usually price locked during negotiation. This is one of the reasons that MU doesn't do better. Many of the smaller or more integrated processor producers rely on these bulk agreements for their chips to be integrated in other people's products, so when memory sees an increase in price, Micron doesn't necessarily make more money. AMD and NVIDIA, on the other hand, either sell directly to the market or have relationships with their vendors where prices are scaled up for each run for the GPUs, meaning that they still benefit from chipset price increases without needing a new contract negotiation.  


Don't get me wrong, INTC could still see a boost, but this would be a fundamentals play and the market doesn't treat bulk contract producers like that with the same expectations.",Moist_Lunch_5075,wallstreetbets,9.0

17,2021-09-12,90% in 2 years across the board is a huge leap. I don't see that being possible. I like AMD I was putting em in my desktops 20 years ago when they were thought to be just cheap knock offs. Long before they became trendy they've always made good chips. I just don't like their business model. TSMC is in control AMD can't continue its path without them. That's never a good situation. The best long term companies no matter which industry do everything they can in house and rely on their own people to pave the way for the companies future. I don't see this shortage working out well for AMD. If it was just waiting till covid restrictions pass that's one thing but every couple months the end to the shortage gets further and further down the road.,2relentless2die,wallstreetbets,17.0
18,2021-09-12,"AMD is currently very well positioned to eat Intel's enterprise CPU market. While inertia in high there Intel currently has practically no products to compete. Both in terms of performance, power efficiency and price to performance. Xeons are currently a joke compared to EPYC. Unless Intel quickly introduces something new AMD will dominate heavily on the most profitable CPU market. Cloudflare already switched to exclusively AMD. Amazon, Google and Microsoft could shortly follow for their cloud services.",reveil,wallstreetbets,18.0
19,2021-09-12,"AMD would be a wreck right now if they were stuck with glofo. I agree that this model is working well for Intel during the chip shortage. But let's say that AMD still has better products 2 years from now (and all signs point to that being the case). And there is no more chip backlog, AMD might take 90% of the server, desktop, and laptop market. Intel will be left making budget products and auto chips. AMD could be worth 3x and Intel might have roughly the same market cap.",BobSacamano47,wallstreetbets,19.0
20,2021-09-12,Being able to control their own production is exactly what I want. Many reasons that's a good thing especially in a shortage. The faster you can get your product to market in a shortage the better. Intel fabs are where the production is needed. You don't have to wait on someone elses limited capacity. You don't have to wait for shipments to get thru customs etc. TSMC production far exceeds anyone but they also have a backlog they have to work thru bigger than anyone I'd imagine. If you need chips do you wait on someone half a world away with a huge lead time. Or do you go to someone right down road offering the same services with a much quicker turn around? Like I've said the auto chips are just one piece to a bigger picture. Amd could lose market share because they are relying on someone else. The better product doesn't out sale the more avaliable product and just because it's the better product today doesn't mean it will be down the road. AMD made a mistake breaking off GF Imo. They got nothing compared to what it could be worth right now. Now AMD is at the mercy of a supply chain that has fallen apart.,2relentless2die,wallstreetbets,20.0
21,2021-09-12,"Intel's foundries will be pumping out chips for years but they are losing high end server and cpu market and will replace it with low end chips like automotive.

Yeah, it is. I'm balls deep into it. I am going to post my YOLO and due diligence when account is 45 days old. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Growth**

- Their next gen cpu's (alder lake) leaks suggest that they outperform amd 5950x in both single &amp; multithreaded benchmarks. We will know for sure in early nov (nov 4th, rumored release date). I wanted to buy before then. https://www.forbes.com/sites/antonyleather/2021/09/27/new-benchmark-leak-reveals-impressive-performance-of-intels-12900k-12700k-and-12600k-alder-lake-processors/ 

&amp;nbsp;

- Intel has basically bought out all of TSMC's 3nm nodes (https://www.techspot.com/news/90780-intel-has-reportedly-secured-majority-tsmc-3nm-production.html). This is insanely bullish for intel. There will be none left for AMD or NVidia. Even apple gets cucked. People *think* that it means that intel is giving up on their own fabs. They are drastically mistaken. This is a double dick size alpha power move by intel. 

 1. Their competition will have a difficult time obtaining fabs to build their next gen cpu's. 

 2. Intel can use these 3nm nodes to stay relevant / potentially be top dog while building their new fabs. This gives them time to transition.

 3. Their new fabs are using ASML's next gen tech (ie: ASML's EUV chip-printing machines). Intel will get them before TSMC &amp; Samsung. There have been many closed door meeting between Gelsinger (intels new CEO) and ASML. https://fortune.com/2021/09/10/intel-ceo-big-honking-fab-planned-eu-europe-most-advanced/

&gt; Thanks to an agreement the Intel CEO struck with his immediate counterpart at ASML, whom Gelsinger has already met three times face-to-face in the six months since taking the helm, the Intel facility should be the first to employ the Dutch company‚Äôs upcoming ‚Äúhigh numerical aperture‚Äù EUV chip-printing machines. (ASML customers Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., known as TSMC, and Samsung are on a waiting list, however.)

&gt; This second generation evolution of ASML‚Äôs extreme ultraviolet photolithography can reduce the size of transistors‚Äîthe building blocks of integrated semiconducting circuits‚Äîto just 20 angstroms (√Ö). That would make them less than a third in length of the current seven-nanometer nodes found in many of today‚Äôs smartphones. 

&amp;nbsp;

- Management changed. This is the biggest point for me. They booted out the finance bean counter, and replaced him with Gelsinger. Gelsinger was the CTO of intel during their glory years and is known as being a super strong engineer. An engineer leading intel sounds 100x better to me than a finance guy trying to cut corners. He is credited with desigining some of their flagship cpu's / architectures that made Intel relevant in the first place. He knows what has to be done.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Gelsinger

- Within his first 6-8 months, all of the above is occuring. They are literally investing over half their market cap into new fabs alone. Plus, there have been some major deals struck with the US gov / military.


- New fabs: Investing ~120b. Two in the states. The ones in europe. Has already started construction on them.

- Hopping into the GPU game. Intel is known for having a good integrated graphics team. I would think that they have enough experience to pull off the dedicated gpu. Time will tell. https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-claimed-to-be-officially-targeting-rtx-3070-performance-with-first-alchemist-gpu/

&amp;nbsp;

**Boomer value**

- Market Cap: ~220b

- P/E: ~12

- 80b revenue

- Stock has been sideways for the last ~3 months, down ~20% from it's peak earlier in the year. The LEAPS I bought have a 3:1 payoff, if it retraces back to $67. ~8-10:1 payoff if my targets hit.

- Personally, my target is ~450-500b market cap. This would put it's P/E ~22-24 (much lower than AMD's). The points above suggest to me that the new management is heavily investing in growth and turning the company around. From a value investing perspective, intel is undervalued via basically all metrics as is.

**Current position, 1100 Jan 2023 $55 INTC calls.**

10,2021-10-02,If they are cracking down on large companies i think it might that's why i haven't bought amd stock. amd with the chip shortage is a no go. if the merger was no were talking about ten 15 percent dips which is awful. the planet is going boom which is really bad.

Thank you for the post because it shows you learned something . Slow down your trades and take a pause and regroup . Invest in undervalued with good growth and hang on or just go with an index ETF .it is boring letting your money grow on its own but its also much easier and generates much less transaction fees along with its easier to file your tax return each year .
That trading mentality takes a while to control but it can be done . 
I would rather hold smaller portions of 25 stocks then large portions of 3 stocks.
I don't don't think about diversification in the same way others might . I use 5 stocks as a minimum per sector 
Amd Nvidia ON intc qrvo as an example for semi conductors.  Pick any sector and find your favorite 5 
It takes time to do this .
I'm sorry though that after 15 years your still negative on your account. 
I'd wait until next year before investing in anything 
Let this market get extremely oversold and then  after your break and time to regroup and come up with a new longer term strategy use the next 3 years to implement that new strategy. 
Trading is about being disaplinned number 1 
Swing trading longer term trades and disaplinned with wider parameters . 
Long term investing also disaplined and like swing trading wider parameters .
After 15 years of trading I'll assume you grasp the basics. 
So stick to daily weekly and monthly charts and learn to look at quarterly or even years charts .
The patterns are the same the entry and exit points are the same . The difference is how long it takes for the pattern to set up and develop and how long it takes before the move is complete. 
Use the next several months to take in your 15 years of experience and re design it on paper by writing it all down without even looking at a chart. 
Then just learn to wait and be bored .

2,2021-10-06,"That is fair. This subreddit is a gambling one FWIW. It's not an investing one lol. There are a couple people who know what they are doing, most who don't, and lots of gamblers. I typically buy LEAPS on things I feel are undervalued. I never hold until expiry, and use it as implicit leverage on a bet I want to take. 

I personally have absolutely no issue taking a 20-30% loss in a position if I believe it's positive expected value when I took the bet and the outlook changes.

Investing has an interesting psychological problem. Losing $1000 feels a lot worse than making $1000 feels good. You need to make $2000+ take get the same magnitude of 'feel good' as you would 'feel bad'. Due to this, most people are too afraid to take losses or enter risky positions, even if the expected value is in their favor. I used to play alot of poker, so have a good understanding of this concept. This is (partially) why people say you should never trade / invest off emotions. All decisions should be made rationally.

As for my leaps, I figure maximum loss (for me) is ~30-50%. I will probably cut losses around there. I feel the floor of $INTC is very close and the upside is massive. If it hits where it was 5 months ago, I get ~300% ROI. And it has a ton of bullish news / products coming out over the next 6-8 months. 

Their ADL CPU is better than the ryzen 5950x (leaks suggest anyways). It's coming out Nov 4th (leaks also suggest). They are releasing GPU's in Q2 2022. They just announced $120b in new fabs (2 already started). They got a $30b us gov contract. They generate $80b in revenue per year. Their market cap is ~$220b. Etc. If any of these events signal a turnaround for intel, it is going to moon. From a boomer value point of view, it is in the 'value buy' territory - ie: undervalued if looking at its financials. It's PE is 1/3 that of AMD. etc. etc.

From a growth perspective, the market has essentially priced intel as if it will never grow / turnaround. Yet, with the management changes + new products coming soon, these changes suggest to me that intel is turning itself around. It will only be a matter of time until the market realizes it.",yardsale2,wallstreetbets,2.0

You don't perceive imbalance, because you feel you and your descendants' position in western society is safe. This is an irony.

It's only happening in the west, because that's where people are migrating to (I wonder why, mist be so terrible here).

54,2021-10-06,"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coveredcall.asp

Anyone can create and sell options (write) as long as they have their brokerages permission (options level approval).  If you write a call without owning any shares it is referred to as ‚Äònaked‚Äô and comes with certain risks (infinite loss), if you own the shares and write a call against them it is a covered call, you agree to sell shares you own for a predetermined amount at or before a set date. In exchange for this agreement you pocket the premium. It works the same for puts but instead of owning the underlying asset you set aside cash to purchase the shares and is referred to as a ‚Äòcash secured put.‚Äô

Ex: you own 100 shares of AMD and want to own more, every week you sell a call a few dollars out of the money against those shares for 100$, no matter what you keep the hundred, you just might have to sell your shares, but since you picked a strike you would actually sell your shares at you don‚Äôt mind.

Then again, I don't actually think I will ever get an opportunity like that again because that situation with AMD only happened at a critical mass of wealth accumulation among dumbasses. When that many retards are in the stock market and there are smart people like me with $0 to get into investing with, it's possible for some insane shit like AMD being down near $2 to happen, but since insane shit like that happens and causes dumbasses to lose huge amounts of money while smart people can turn virtually nothing into a fortune, it quickly corrects itself and you get back to a lower concentration of dumb people with money and a lower concentration of smart people without money and then it gets harder for anything that insane to happen with prices.

\- Intel will leapfrog AMD by the end of October with Alder Lake and AMD has nothing to counter with for the next year and a half. This is massive in terms of sentiment change, from ""AMD is the best"" to ""AMD is behind"".

\- TSMC capacity is all booked by Apple, Qualcomm and Intel, preventing AMD from improving their node process. They just do not have enough money to outbid competitors.

\- Intel will release its own mid-range GPUs early next year, undercut on pricing, and use TSMC capacity to starve AMD.

\- Supply shortages are not getting any better, preventing AMD from capitalizing on their current advantages. By the time they are resolved, Intel will capitalize on laptop and server processors with Alder Lake using its own capacity.

\- Xilinx merger may get cockblocked or delayed by China, as well as force AMD to make costly concessions.

Don't think twice about yoloing into a good company that is at or near ATH.  No bagholders = no one looking to offload bags at the nearest uptick.  This is why whenever people try to catch a falling knife, it usually doesn't work out.  Many bagholders = price suppression on any uptick as bagholders look to move on.  PLTR and CRSR are 2 examples of stocks that got stuck in this shitty loop.  Neither can maintain a sustained uptick because bagholders are unloading at high volume any time stock moves up to their break-even point

As for INTC it doesn't matter how well you build the house if the foundation is flawed you can keep improving the house but your main design and structural problem still exists.  That's their main problem.  

Their track record for innovating cpu, modems/socs, gpus in the last dozen years has been subpar.  

Last I spoke with contractor at Intel the ethos and culture hasn't changed so until I see results you can't say it'll turn around.  

It probably takes half a decade to design and implement a good cpu and people act like a CEO change magically does that next quarter, year, years.  

I've not seen any 3rd party benchmarks that aren't influenced that would suggest Intel GPU is competitive.  Intel saying it'll compete with the 3070 is just nonsense  until we see the numbers and when it's out in full force the 3070 will be way behind anyways.",moldyjellybean,wallstreetbets,77.0

One thing I haven't heard anyone talking about is how they are setting up to price AMD out of competition. With TSMC raising prices and INTC leveraging their fabs with the ability to offer value pricing. what can AMD do? Drop prices and wreck margins or keep margins and lose sales? Damned if they do damned if they dont. Seems like it's the beginning of a long term problem for AMD.

Basically. Let‚Äôs say I buy 100 shares of AMD stock at $130.53 (so you need $13,053 to cover cost. I then sell the slightly in-the-money Nov 12 covered call with the 130 strike price at 3.20 (meaning I instantly get back $320). If the stock closes on Nov. 12 above $130, I still just made a realized gain of 320-53=$267. In 8 days, I made a tidy profit and now have that 13k to invest in another ‚ÄúBuy Write‚Äù strategy. (Buy Write is the term for Buying Stock, Selling the Covered Call simultaneously).

If the stock closes below $130 (out of the money)? I get to write another call for Nov. 19 etc etc. 

In this strategy - you *want* the stock to be called away. There are a zillion stocks out there. You‚Äôre only buying the stock to turn a quick profit. *Thats it*. Theoretically, the only research I do is: will this company be up (or at least not frantically down) in the next few days (hence: I don‚Äôt create a buy write on a stock with imminent earnings) and does it have a good premium attached to it. 

The two ‚Äúdrawback‚Äù with this strategy: 
- if the stock skyrockets you don‚Äôt participate in the gains. Only up to your strike price. 
- you need enough money/margin in your account to buy at least 100 shares of the stock.",12frets,wallstreetbets,50.0

Even if it's on par and from what I've read it's not on par when you are using 2x the power and putting out a lot more heat even if you got close to performance you technically aren't on par with the competition.  

I know it's hard for people to grasp but energy efficiency is the future and why I'm super bullish on TSLA, battery tech, solar, ev etc.  At scale saving energy is saving billions in power consumption, cooling, space etc that's what my post many years alluded to.  That's why people like you don't get ""it"", you think if INTC catches up in performance it's a win but that's only a small part of the equation.  And they aren't even on par, maybe if you select a few cherry picked benchmarks but non of the real world stuff that matters in datacenters, Intel is failing every metric.  

Everyday, month, quarter, year AMD NVDA breaks new highs and INTC goes sideways around the $50 mark for 5 years.

Amd has had amazing earnings growth. If it continues the current stock price may be justified in 5 years. If earnings growth slows down then the current price is not justified.

79,2021-11-04,"Hi all,  
  
Instead of getting proper health insurance, I elected to have a high deductible health insurance policy which allowed me to contribute 3k annually into a Health Savings Account. What's fascinating about having an HSA is you are allowed to trade stocks in a tax-advantaged brokerage account. Starting in 2017, I contributed 2k of my own money post-tax, and my company contributed 1k on my behalf, and with a little as $54/weekly contribution into my HSA TD Ameritrade account, turned it to 58k! Early notable trades were $GBTC in early 2017, but I sold too soon back then. My biggest loser was $CPNG unfortunately. Luckily I jumped on the NVDA, AMD, and SQ train. +544.55% in NVDA in my HSA. Thank you based boss Jensen and niece Lisa Su!

&amp;#x200B;

INTC generates a lot of revenue and pays dividends, but it is a long term play. The foundry side of intel is what you want to be investing in them for because the world sees how regions need local high tech chip foundries and intel is building more and more of them and you're investing in them now for payoffs in a few years. INTC is just not a good short term play, so it moves like a snail until the time comes that they finally can deliver chips which dont consume too much power and then they'll start reclaiming more market share. 

when intel was at $48, LEAPS at $50 would have been a very solid play if you could get them because they're cheap af... they're still cheap to be honest. 

&amp;#x200B;

remember INTC moves slow. they're definitely 100% undervalued af. everyone knows this, so LEAPS is the smart money play. Go look at the open interest of $50, $55 calls for jan 2023. it's a smart play if you dont mind the wait and have excess $ to do so.",EnigmaSpore,wallstreetbets,68.0

What good is it if Apple can make amazing chips on TSMCs 5nm node if they can only get 50% of the chips they were expecting from TSMC? Taiwan is only a few miles away from China and the thing with geo-politics is that when they go south, they do so in unexpected ways.

They‚Äôve basically disrupted our whole economy without even shooting a single round, all under the pretext of global warming and Covid complications.

There's no question Intel is a successful company, but they're still riding on the coattails of their previous success over the last 30+ years. The computing market has been shifting away from x86(their core business) to ARM and other risc based architectures for a while now - ie apple's m1 for personal computers and Amazon's graviton2 for servers.

Also, they have almost no market share in mobile, memory, discrete GPUs, etc. The fact that they dropped the ball so hard here means they have no idea what they're doing and it's a little too late for them to play catch up.

The only thing Intel has right now are slightly faster x86 cpus which just barely beat AMD's from last year. They're actually worse in many ways because they decided to go with stupid ""e-cores"" which waste silicon that could have been used for more ""p-cores"" and massively complicate process scheduling. Whatever tiny lead they have right now will be gone in no time. Like many enthusiasts, I'm waiting for AMD to release zen 4 which won't have any garbage efficiency cores - that alone should scare you as most market sentiment is likely leaning that way which is not a good long term outlook for intc...

Lastly, placing a bet against tsmc because they're in the country Taiwan is ridiculously stupid. They make chips for literally every trillion dollar company so there's massive money behind them to ensure their success - and it's not like intel is going to pick up the slack in case of anything(they actually outsource some production to tsmc).

This is a long play, but due to government pressures, one that should yield positive results within the next year or two. Many felt AMD was trash even after Ryzen 2 because they failed to see the fundamental changes in the company, who they hired and their roadmap.

50,2021-11-07,Keep in mind AMD is focusing their resources on data center. Intel did the same last quarter. I think Intel is just falling to just another player in the game.

51,2021-11-07,"yeah no one is throwing away their billions of sunk cost, and many more billions in man hours.

INTC is definitely losing market share faster than most think.

23,2021-11-09,"FYSA-- Your Point 7 and Point 8 are seriously flawed.  Grain of salt as this comes from an intel boi whom just sold all his intel stock for AMD stock (really bought Xilinx stock for the 25% arbitrage). 

7. Intel is no longer the more power efficient of the two with the recently released latest generation.  They had to dump all the power they could into the CPU to be able to compete with current-gen AMD.  AMD is about to release next gen in 3 months with general expectation to crush Intel's latest gen for the desktop market.  

leading to point 8...

8. AMD's Epyc server has ran away from Intel as competition -- it's no longer even close.  AMD just announced yesterday their next gen Epyc is expected to have \~50% uplift (in *common* workloads, so VM heavy crap); and the following gen to double their core count to 128 cores. Intel's best is a 38 core CPU which cost more and substantially less powerful then current/last gen AMD Epycs.  FB is utilizing AMD chips, Msoft is rolling out VM infra using AMD chips, I've been rolling my own shops servers over to Epycs. 

&amp;#x200B;

The scariest part to your thesis is if AMD continues to make inroads into the AI segment; if they pull off the ai inference chips right that they been working on, big bucks.

That's why theta gang almost always wins.

Option leverage is approximate delta * share price / option price, so these are at about 2.5x, only slightly more than margin will let you buy.

Those 5 years of intel dominance is because of their node leadership. Now they lost that node leadership and their momentum is taking for the worst.

They're fighting a losing battle against TSMC, especially when Pat announced the $26B investment on their fabs and said that they will produce 5 nodes in 4 years and regain the node leadership by 2025. I don't know what flavor of cool-aid he is taking but 5 nodes on 4 years is insane! especially when they're stuck with 14nm for god knows how many years and their 7nm (or now called as Intel 4) has been delayed until next year.

24,2021-11-10,"Eh. I own all 3 stocks so I'm somewhat neutral. Amd won't catch nvda on the gpu front. Except for a few circumstances nvda always will outperform. It doesn't really matter how good an amd gpu is their driver support is terrible and if a 700 dollar gpu that performs like a 1500 dollar gpu sounds good, which it should but in reality it doesn't matter because the drivers are crap and real world performance always lags benchmarks. 

On the cpu front. I'd only use amd cpus on a workstation. The higher core count per dollar is nice but my 5950 system with a 2080ti never ran as well on 2k as my 9900k system with the same gpu. Both have ram tailored for the system and adequate cooling using msi mobos. This is in cod warzone which is heavily cpu dependant. The 9900k is at 5ghz both use noctua 2 tower coolers. And 32gb of b die ram. The amd system has memory tailored to the infinity fabric frequency as well so don't give me that frequency crap. The issue with the 5950 is I get frequent stuttering and lag fps drops. Not network related. If I spin 360  between the downtown and airport runway while on the hill ill lose 50fps. Dropping from 150 to 100 around the time I'm looking at array. 1440p same settings as my 9900k but fir whatever reason my 9900k system doesn't have these stutters when replicating.

As their main business. 
Intel make microprocessors. NVIDIA makes graphics card. AMD makes both. 

AMD wasn‚Äôt able to get in server segment, was mostly a candidate for PCs and laptops for many years. Now they are growing strong in that arena. Meta deal is a big proof for that. If they grow in server segment they are bound to eat the market share  of intel. So if you are comparing PEs of AMD to intel then market perceives AMD to be a better growth stock than intel and is willing to pay more for the stock. Look at your profit on the capital you invest and the stock you buy not the just the PE ratio. Intel is a giant in microprocessors AMD has a lot of room to grow and eat away intel‚Äôs monopoly. Being a high growth stock I would be bothered even if their PE worsens, till the time they can continue with the growth. 5-10 year or who knows even earlier Intel might be ready to eat AMD‚Äôs monopoly.

&gt; One worrying factor is in the server market. Everyone seems to be launching their own server chips and AMD is very competitive and eating away market share. But Intel's management seems to be guiding us towards the right path. If their predictions prove to be right, they are on the right track.

Really server space is the key to valuation. But but the only analysis given here is that ""Intel's management seems to be guiding us towards the right path."" Like what the heck does that even mean? What is the management doing that makes you think things are going a-ok in the server wars?

368,2021-11-10," intel are getting back into gear . But I think this is too early. 2023 is when shit really gets interesting for intel. Sierra. And the path to that is very much up in the air given amd being this competitive

Amd are on a roll and their counters plays have been simplistic in relation to what intel needs 

Amd: stack another die on top of zen3

Intel: hybrid compute is a must to compete. A total new uarch another core library etc 

Point is as much of a feat CoW is, it's most definitely less resource intensive compared to designing a new uarch. Validating two unique cores, even more so

What I suspect that means is zen4 or zen5 is a mean competitor that has had a lot more engineering time put into it than usual. They basically get a extra year for uarch development due to CoW playing off

Intel do not have a full run yet, I think there's defo more risk atm give zen3d is like a month away and could really sway who's leading here",ImSkripted,wallstreetbets,368.0

They're trying to prove to investors and shareholders that they're going to be profitable in the long term but they need to sacrifice short term to get there.

For now, they're still holding on to their massive server market share which are being eaten by AMD and other ARM players. Their Ice lake servers is a massive flop that cloudflare skip the entire thing. Netflix and the newest AMD customer, Facebook are using AMD server part because of how AMD can customize their tech according to the clients need.  Chinese tech companies are switching to AMD given the fact that during the Intel's latest earning call they said a weak demand whereas when AMD asked the same question AMD answer that the Chinese market has the same level of demand for their chips as the previous quarter.

&gt;https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/governor-wolf-bipartisan-governors-urge-congress-to-pass-chips-act-to-create-american-jobs-boost-semiconductor-production/

So far the shortage has cost 2.2 Million vehicles. That could just be a tiny fraction if Taiwan has more serious future issues such as natural disasters or a China invasion, which could cost businesses TRILLIONS in damages to companies such as:  Ford (F) , General Motors (GM) , and Toyota (TM), Dell Technologies (DELL),  Apples (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), AMD, NVDA, and many more.


&gt;The group, which also includes the governors of auto-producing states like Alabama, said the shortage had cost automakers 2.2 million vehicles and affected 575,000 jobs in the industry.

&gt;The semiconductor funding passed the U.S. Senate earlier this year by 68-32 as part of the broader U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, or USICA. But it has not passed the House of Representatives.



https://www.reuters.com/world/us/nine-governors-press-us-lawmakers-pass-semiconductor-funding-bill-2021-11-10/

Much of this funding plus possibly more in the future, seems likely to go to Intel (INTC).

I dont think the US gov is interested in paying foreign companies to build in the US since it wont really help the US to be independent. eg.

People who think they understand market very well, kinda miss the point. Market is unpredictable, no one got the cheatsheet to play it. Chart plays only to the extent and with plenty of money on peoples hand, i see the dip being brought up quickly than missing out.

If nvda earnings smashes and moves 10 points higher, do you think amd just sit there and pull back?

Same goes in bearish way, if nvda pulls back 20 points do you think amd will go up 20 points?

12/1/21, 12:00
December 1, 2021 01:00 PM ET (BZ Newswire) -- Long Ideas

Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) is up more than 70% year-to-date, so Jim Cramer decided to lock in profits and trim his position.

""We are trimming AMD this morning solely for portfolio management purposes and not out of any change to our bullish long-term view of the company,"" Cramer said Wednesday in a letter to members of CNBC's ""Investing Club.""

He noted that he purchased AMD stock in February and is realizing an 80% gain by selling shares today.

Despite citing prudent portfolio management as the reason for trimming AMD, Cramer said he refuses to sell any shares of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), which is up more than 150% year-to-date.

""I'm being a pig in Nvidia,"" Cramer said Wednesday on CNBC. ""Because this may be a $10 trillion stock.""

The reason for some of the massive losses was buying short term OTM calls on tickers seen on WSB with no further research on the underlying hoping to get rich quick.  Another one was attempting to do earnings plays with spreads using too much capital and the position moves against you.  Position sizing is important.

The only reason why the last 2.5k wasn't a complete failure is I had some Ironnet puts and AMD calls (earnings runup) that brought me from 1.2k -&gt; 3kish.

Then I started focusing on earnings plays as there was a guy that is unusually good at getting them right, hourly amphibian or something like that, can't remember their name.  Went from 3k -&gt; 7k account size off of PTON puts, lost some of it on companies that unexpectedly went up after earnings (thanks SOFI and BIG), gained a decent amount with ZM puts, and a fairly massive amount with DOCU and ASAN puts 6k -&gt; 14k.

Also to note, since going all the way to 1.2k, I've been putting aside my profits in VOO so I'm not tempted to use it on a stupid play.

So for the time being I'm sticking with buying puts on overvalued companies before earnings, but I would like to start some mid-term and long-term positions once this downturn is over.

3,2021-12-08,"I should've been a little bit more specific, sorry.

I started out with 40k savings, and bought almost all AAPL/MSFT/QQQ shares in 2016 and held until now. A lot of those stocks have gotten 400%+ gains over the 5 years. Then every paycheck I got throughout the years, I kept putting money into stocks into a mixed ratio of safe stocks vs high-risk stocks. I would always make sure that I was allocating most of my portfolio into safe stocks, and a small portion into riskier option plays. I would never risk more than 5-10% of my portfolio on option plays / earnings plays / meme stocks / what have you. I made some big mistakes on options, and made some gains on options. In the end I think I only profited a little bit, and I still have a ways to go when it comes to learning how to be a better options trader. However, my ""long term"" stocks have mostly always gone up, and by safe I mean I was periodically buying AMD, TSLA, NVDA, HD, FB through the years on top of the FAANG that I already had and \*never\* selling. I misspoke when I said I turned 40K into 400K. It was more like I started with 40K, and kept adding money in (from my paychecks) and buying brand-name stocks until my portfolio rose to 400K. In the end I think out of the 400K total amount, almost 100k of it was my own capital from the money I saved from my paychecks from 2016-now (which includes the 40K I started with). The rest were gains. I know this goes against the entire WSB mantra of YOLO-ing everything but at the end of the day, long term stocks are rewarding with patience. The YOLO part is all fun but \*extremely\* high risk and may not be the best idea if you can't handle big losses. Hope that makes sense",AshamedEstate1974,wallstreetbets,3.0

To do this, I‚Äôm gonna keep my $AAPL shares and either get another 100 shares to hold 300 shares outstanding or stay with 200 shares and one LEAPS. From here, I need to do some research on $INTC since my gut is saying they‚Äôve been beaten down for far too long and start as 2 LEAPS and hope to gather enough premium and contract appreciation and turn them into 200 shares. Same strategy with $JPM, $AMD, $MSFT, and maybe even $COIN to be a bit spicy. $SPY and $QQQ will be going into my retirement accounts as LEAPS then to shares.

136,2021-12-07,"I had AMD at $78, sold ~$120 (too early :( ). Bought intel leaps at ~$53. Going to continue to hold them. IMO, LittleBig is more influential than the market is giving it credit for, for mobile. I may be wrong there - we will see in 2022. I think the '2 year gap' the market is pricing in, is incorrect. A large part of AMD's advantage has been due to having TSMC's fabs and being able to work with smaller nodes. If intel matched them - they would crush amd. Unfortunately their fabs have lagged behind. Alder lake is using 10nm... it's still lagging. However, their new fabs look super promising and could turn intel back into the powerhouse it once was. Only time will tell...",yardsale2,wallstreetbets,136.0
137,2021-12-07,"Agree. It might be to soon but amzn starting own server cpu buisness (rumors about it) takes a piece of that amd cake that has momentum in server biz. 

I mean. LittleBig might get intel on pair in desktop but it will definetly boost laptop buisness. Dont get me wrong, AMD is 2 years a head in desktop, but Intel could challange them price wise 2022. I dont think Alder Lake will be better, but more competetive.  2023 or 2024. Unless AMD pulls a trick.

62,2021-12-08,"Yeah, the call when Ryzen was coming out wasn't even complicated to anyone knowledgeable in the CPU space.  It was abundantly clear that the stock market is (or at least wasn't) populated with many such people.  The first Ryzen chips were slated to be released the day after AMD announced earnings for the quarter.  They announced poor earnings, OBVIOUSLY, because every soul who needed a CPU knew Ryzen was getting released and so was holding off purchases.  But the market didn't care, it only saw poor earnings and dipped like an idiot.  So that's when I bought in.  I didn't own any stock at the time, did some trading a few years earlier but just hadn't been involved for awhile but this was such a screaming no-doubt play I had to get in.  It was around $28 or something I think, I bought in, then bought more, eventually got to a cost basis of like $38 and sat on it.  My plan was sell when Intel fought back.

Of course Ryan Cohen has ""a business strategy"" just like every other company has ""a business strategy"". But ultimately, Gamestop is a company that has been built around brick and mortar game sales. Completely changing the business fundamentals of a decades old business is a nearly impossible task, and an entirely different beast than creating a successful startup like RC did with Chewy.

Also, Gamestop's earning calls are extremely vague so it's impossible to really know what their strategy actually is. All we know is that they're focusing on online sales, but Gamestop doesn't have the infrastructure to  do anything beyond video games and novelty clothing. I see no feasible solution to the fact that video game downloads are becoming increasingly popular, and consumers have no reason to keep a middle man when you can just get video games in their living room on the Xbox Live store, for example.

The only other real idea I've heard from them is some extremely vague NFT stuff.

Thing is you shouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äútrading‚Äù stock you idiot. If you‚Äôre going to trade, trade options. Trading options is worth it if you ACTUALLY have conviction in a directional movement relative to a time frame. So if you plan to trade options six months out, you better be banking on a move in two months. Or if they‚Äôre 7DTE it better be a move happening tomorrow. If it doesn‚Äôt, you need to trade out for either a small profit or a loss.

If you‚Äôre buying stock, you should be *investing*. You should always assume as soon as you buy stock you‚Äôre going to be sitting red for 10-20% for *months* because of volatility and market makers sapping options premium and institutions shorting stocks as they do. 

The good news is that investing long term is literally the best strategy you can implement if the company you invest in is solid.

It‚Äôs stupid how well it works for people who are patient and not stupid. There‚Äôs probably thousands of new millionaires born because they liked and bought AMD stock 3-4 years ago and dumped their life savings in because they not only used their products, but saw them gaining market share from intel, developing superior products, and having a market cap that at the time was 1\20th that of INTC while having superior edge in manufacturing and marketing. Find some deep value man and sit on it.

Why does every Intel stock owner post this info regarding Intel 10nm and TSMC 7nm.  Their used a flawed logic that since Intel 10nm competes with TSMC 7nm then once Intel release their 7nm their way ahead in foundry tech.  In reality their pretty much equal in terms of transistor density.  This confusion is why Intel is relabeling their 10nm node processors to 7nm.

39,2021-12-12,"Hmm... here's the thing: Online retail/niche services trades have been crashing out, but online infrastructure and normal growth business tech services have been flying (Oracle, MDB, AVGO, NVDA, AMD, etc) so what's the bias on Adobe's growth potential in an expanding market?

It's a tough call, but my predilection is to be bullish on these companies right now. Docusign crashed out, for instance, because it's the kind of thing people use LESS coming out of a pandemic, and the same with CHWY. Those stocks rode considerable sentiment through the pandemic.

While ADBE looks high (like most momentum stocks on the market right now) what AVGO demonstrated last week is that even a stock that's been on a run can run further, especially when pulled back.

Also, looking at ADBE's chart there's an uncomfirmed cup and handle structure to consider, with an already realized 50 pt pullback from the high having just rebounded off of the SMMA 50 on the daily candlestick chart, with a mid-level RSI14, a bullish MACD convergence, and the structure looks like, if it realizes, it could potentially run another 100 pts just based on the long-trend technicals alone. 

Risks are if we have a really bad market week because of the Fed, then it might decline down towards the SMMA 100 (based on past performance, during downturns it can hit that threshold, but it's rare) which would be around roughly 590-600 around earnings day... but if it does hit that the stock has historically rebounded off of it. 

Honestly? I think from the technical and fundamentals aspects, my bias is overall bullish on ADBE... but that SMMA 100 read does suggest there's some room to run down on a disappointment. Without some real good fundamentals information suggesting it should disappoint, though, a bet against ADBE is basically a bet against a high number and a hope that the NASDAQ will crash throughout the week, which even with an FOMC meeting is not a reliable bet.",Moist_Lunch_5075,wallstreetbets,39.0
