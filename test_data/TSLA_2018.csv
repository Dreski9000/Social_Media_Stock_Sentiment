I learned by getting burned... is there any other way?  Diversification is a bunch of bullshit.  Amzn has crazy growth in India, why do I need to have an intl growth guy w assets there.  For fixed income apple &amp; brka get better rates than treasury, so I’ll let them handle the fixed income.  I left the business because I hated how my involvement with their accounts cost them money.  Im very anti having financial advisers make more than 25 basis points, the industry disgusted me so I got out and manage my own money.  When I meet people or old clients I advise them for free and have them do their own trades at places like schwab.

If you were one of my clients you wouldnt be pissed because beating the market is the job.  Understanding risk return shows up when you beat the market, dont get it twisted.  Greatest thing about the biz is the numbers are the numbers.  The big firms put together a bunch of bs &amp; terms and its designed to confuse and cost more.  I currently own Tsla, lulu &amp; nvda and am looking to build a career helping the environment while making more funds to invest.  

But for all here, its nearly impossible to beat 50/50 brk.b &amp; qqq.  You just hold it and wait.  Berkshire is designed to outperform in bad markets, its the only time they can buy companies for cheap like they do.  Everyone needs qqq bc those tech companies that climb that ladder are world leaders.  Happy investing",dwaynereade,wallstreetbets,0.0

I thought they were the future because they were sustainable.

Or is that not a form of government support of an industry built around a certain resource?

&gt; Shits been done since the 90's

Even before then. Trolleybuses have been around for a long time, for over 100 years.

Fast charging and battery management is probably where TSLA did a lot of work as well as the self driving stuff they are working on. Elon has a track record of building successful businesses. Autonomous driving car potential is huge. Plus there is also the aspect (which probably mainly comes from millennials) of supporting the cause of sustainable energy cars, and investing-for-cause.

Those are probably the main reasons for TSLAs insane mkt cap.

Plus even though it says unlimited risk, you can still exit the trade before max damage is done, and theta rn is through the roof so all he has to do is wait a week and the option will be valued even lower.

No, theoretically you'll be collecting theta if tsla is trading below roughly 247.50 and paying theta while it's above 247.50.

21,2018-04-12,"*Full disclosure, I haven't read your entire post*

I watched an interview with Mark Spiegel where he made a lot of similar points, he went as far as calling Elon Musk a fraud and a stock promoter. I don't remember any details, but all summed up he made a really great case for shorting TSLA. He also admitted to the problem that it's a cult stock and it might keep going up, but he's short (and has been since $90 but has added to his position at 200 and 300). He probably lost a lot of money on TSLA and AMZN shorts, but I think his thesis makes sense in any market that isn't as irrational as what we currently have. He made a lot of points not just about fraud or almost fraudulent practises (""creative accounting"" and such) and burning cash but also the insane competition that Tesla will soon face, they obviously aren't the only ones making EV and he thinks they'll be outdone by better, more experienced car companies soon. Another point he made was about how Elon treats the public short sellers, ridiculing and insulting them; apparently no CEOs who have treated well-researched critics like that have seen their company do well in the long run.

Overall, I was very convinced but I wouldn't touch it with a 10ft pole; if really good traders can lose loads of money with an insane amount of research that spans over years and lots of connections and capital backing their bet, I'll probably lose my entire account over it. Maybe if I saw a definite catalyst, but so far they've been able to brush off anything that would have lost other companies like 60% of their market cap.",nikmav2,wallstreetbets,21.0

Plan for today: sell my $SPY put at/near open, then buy some longer-dated $265 calls. For my $TSLA positions, I'm hoping to take advantage of the FUD surrounding that stock and make money in both directions.

They would claim projected profit from a project up front, and if the project started losing money, they would transfer the asset to a subsidiary. This meant that their subs were losing tons of money, but because the assets were mark to market on the books, it allowed them to hide massive losses. It's not that their income or revenue wasn't real. It was. The thing is, the losses were also real, and those didn't show up on the books. 

I think with hindsight, those strange quotes were obviously covering up a fraud. The thing is, companies that aren't fraudulent make retarded statements on earnings calls all the time. If you're really worried about TSLA, I'd explore their bonds a little more. They're in rough shape, and the worse it gets, the worse their ability to acquire more debt becomes.

Bernstein"", and its parent company: AllianceBernstein L.P. has a short interest on TSLA now, so Toni Sacconaghi was given orders from above to put a negative spin on Tesla by using meanness and escalate verbal abuse between him and Musk on the 6PM EST May 2 conference call, with coordinated parent TSLA selloff to correspond to the same minute when the argument occurred. Everything went according to plan, TSLA dropped 7 percent in after hours trading, at the precise moment when the heated exchange occurred.

Using your position of power to spin hate against Musk so that your short-selling parent company can profit via short term gains runs afowl of SEC pump-and-dump laws and insider trading.  

Berating a stock using your power over a conference call, and coordinating a selloff at the same time to create the manipulative sentiment that there is problems at Tesla is unethical and illegal.  We need to have a prime time news dialog exposing such manipulative behavior from smart money day traders.

Enron basically double counted all of their acquisitions, and looked extremely solid revenue wise until the fraud was revealed. You couldn't find that data looking at SEC documents, you would have had to audit the company to realize their accounting was shit. 

Of course, the company auditing their books was also committing fraud, so publicaly available audits didn't help either. 

The only way one could have known about Enron was if you suspected that they were in bed with their private auditors, and even then, you would have sounded insane.

36,2018-05-03,"I wanted to write on here a story of success I have had when focusing on limited risk/profit, high probability trades. Just a little contrast to the lunacy on this page. I LOVE the faggots here on WSB, fav sub ever, but I can’t live up to the nuts you guys have.  So I wanted to report in on a little research I have been doing.  Please forgive the long post, its as short as I can make it as I am passionate as fuck about my experience.

Around a few months ago I decided to get in on options.  I heard here and there that options offer a high level of control and choice for the buyer. I have done crypto but was super frustrating with not being able to utilize trading analysis *at all*.  Made some money due to pure timing in crypto and of course at the beginning of the year everything changed.  The fun was gone, every move meant you came out negative at the end of the day because of the stupid fluctuation. Crypto was not worth the mental mortgage I was paying and it ceased to be fun trading.  I decided I was gonna make the switch over to learning options and put myself at study for a few months and see how it came out.  I wasn’t even aware that options had expirations or anything.  I did have a TOS account for just buying straight long stock. Haha.  Thank God for TOS and being able to call into an educated american 24/7.

I got good direction on Reddit and watched tons of youtube option intro videos...ultimately coming across a series of videos that was done pretty well and explained clearly...done by Sky View Trading.  Let me just be very clear, I am in no way a paid shill for these guys and their work, I actually joined their membership…..but let me just say that their service is so freaking awesome and interactive.  They have a full catalog of teaching videos, daily trade videos, email support, “official” trade alerts when they place them so you can just copy them exactly if you want.  Also a very active chat room during hours that is manned by a killer guy, Cristos, so you can post your ideas for trade and they give you feedback on the trade before you place it.  They NEVER say change your spread or anything, they more explain why you should change strike selection, what delta you look for, iv and other components.  They teach militantly, not deviating from the education material in their videos at all, won’t even discuss outside of their rules.  This is one of the reasons I love options and at the end of the day with backtesting and everything across multiple programs I have learned that when played like a fucking robot you will see a 92% win rate.  It’s when you get that human element added….and sentiment driven activity that your advantages are stripped.  The lovely Faggots Delight ought not be uttered.

I do also use TastyTrade resources and listen to their podcasts every day, at a minimum Last Call.  Seems like the teachings there are kind of in the same lane.
Sky View has taught me about “multiple concurrent single contract high probability premium selling options spreads, mostly Iron Condors, done on average 45 DTE outside of earnings with high liquidity tickers managed at 40-50% of max profit”.  Sound confusing, it is at first but ask me and I can explain further if you like.

Looks like i placed my first Iron Condor on Feb 25th and every trade that I have closed is listed in the pic along with various statistics I track to analyze myself.  I have been adding IV along with this stats moving forward.  I have tried to be a robot about it, play the rules and see if it is possible to outperform the market.  If I could put my time into something that isn’t a guess or doesn’t worry about directional movement overall. Also something I could scale.  Well as a complete noob, I am up from being able to have like 6 positions on at a time. Right now I have 15 open trades with expirations through June that I completely put together myself and money left over for opportunity buys.  I have achieved 13/14 wins and the one I did lose I didn’t follow the rules about position sizing because TSLA and Elon’s fat dong….so totally human error on my part, lesson learned.  Also if you look closely you will see a couple wild Faggot’s Delights on there, what can I say, I love the feel of it.  I should NOT be doing them as I am trying to be in a test environment.  I need to stop.

My plan is to cancel Skyview this month, do this for another year to prove it to myself and figure out how to scale this bitch.

If you are curious at all, please feel free to ask me whatever and I would be happy to discuss or point you to the correct resources.  I’m very excited and hope this reaches at least one other option noob.

$TSLA is possibly my favorite stock to trade because it actually moves enough that you have a reasonable chance of making money in both directions.

Tied with FB. Beats AMZN (7 I think), BABA, MSFT (all those around 8-9)  They grew in revenue as fast as a dude who monetized half the world in ~8 years (our man zuck)

I'll only defend myself with some food for thought. I'll re-hash these points once in awhile, I can't help it.

Profit point has been hit for auto mfg for a couple years, but everything else has been capex and R&amp;D which, in mfg is huge -- (TSLA is the only mfg example of the aforementioned tech platforms...mfg has high capex and tech has R&amp;D. Double whammy of expensive thangs) 

They are hyperspending while other auto mfgs are avoiding the elephant by putting half-assed efforts and retaining stale assets. They have to create a tesla-esque-or-better-2025 plant while still showing profit (to please shareholders) on an already razor-thin margin. If they aren't doing the definition of *kicking the can down the road* ...well, godspeed. Added bonus: they're literally paying a dividend to shareholders instead of investing in EV infrastructure. Why? [Because the board &amp; CEO are old as fuck and think short-term politics is a good thing.](https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future-ebook/dp/B00J6YBOFQ). ""Fuck that, I'm retiring in 5 years, funnel money out of the pensions and get me the fuck outta here."" 

(Existing PPOE of a car mfg is a technologically stale asset. To re-adjust for the EV revolution -- which is 100% happening -- is ungodly expensive)

As odd as it sounds, seeking a *profit* on TSLA's balance sheet at this stage is penny-wise, dollar stupid. Much like amazon and most other tech companies, the shit you do in the early stages really fucking pays off later.

10,2018-05-11,"There are so many contradictions in your statement and its based on super-hype, uncritical analysis of a car company. 

1) The cool factor is irrelevant when everyone is driving around in a Model 3. People today don't buy iPhones because they are ""cool"". They buy them because they work and are a part of an apple ecosystem created over a decade after the company had become established. People buy macs because they are easy to use. The coolness factor significantly declines as time passes and is NOT a competitive advantage. 
2) You don't buy a 40k+ car if you care about marginal savings in fuel. This is not a competitive advantage. 
3) Laws and regulations are holding Tesla from using full automation...fine (this is not true, full automation is still being worked on). Either way, this is very bad for Tesla because it gives others massive lead time to build this technology before it becomes a key selling point for Tesla. Again, not a competitive advantage. 
4) Full automation renders the performance aspects of a vehicle redundant...thereby hurting Tesla. No one gives a fuck about its speed and smoothness in driving if it's going to be automated. 
5) No economies of scale 
6) No financing, pre-owned, and leasing arm...a huge cash cow for established car companies. 
7) Owner doesn't care about money, only about pushing technology/humankind forward. This is great for society, not for a company to invest in. I wouldn't be surprised if he happily takes TSLA private for its technology when its stock price collapses. 
8) Capital raises needed going forward.

21,2018-06-06,"Idk why there were like 6 posts assuming there are no legit ""wall street traders"" here. I'll probably get a lot of flack for it, but I started my career in IB in one of the big ""wall street banks"", that everyone here thinks is controlling the world and loves to hate. Did my analyst stint in M&amp;A and restructuring. Moved from IB to PE for most of my career, but also spent some decent time at a HF.

Because of my experience, specifically around special sits and restructuring, it influences a lot of how I evaluate a stock, namely around fundamental value. I was never on the markets desks where they were looking at daily price movements and all the different signals. So the way I look at a stock is more value-oriented - why is a stock cheaper than its peers, industry, what I think it should be worth, etc.

This strategy actually burned me for a long time, and I quickly realized the market can be irrational for very very long periods before your thesis will play out. This didn't bode well for my hyper-rational ideology, so it took some mental adjustment. It's a fool's game when you're betting on value in a growth environment, and vice versa. I spent a lot of my time trying to eliminate beta and extract alpha, when so much of returns are beta-driven, and a risk-on/risk-off approach would've been much more successful. My success turned around when I realized these things and tried to incorporate a lot of the ""irrational"" market dynamics into my analysis - momentum, technical indicators, etc. I don't think it's safe to trade on those signals alone (you could potentially pick up a number of pennies before the steamroller runs you over), so I try to marry fundamental analysis with market sentiment/technical analysis.

In other words, if I see a stock I think is undervalued, I will watch it for a bit. It might stagnate for months, but, when the market tide appears to be shifting in its direction, I'll start putting in a small position, and growing it over time as conviction deepens. The key is to have *some* target price or valuation that you think a security is worth, rather than ""oh, it'll go up because everyone says it will"". This will help your entries and exits if you actually have an underlying thesis to which you're beholden.

Lastly, it's super super important to understand risk. Only ""bet"" what you can lose, and have a risk framework in mind. I'm not saying FDs are retarded... they can be a lot of fun, but understand them for what they are - gambling. I put some bets out there based on where I think market sentiment is flowing coupled with my conviction around a name and short term catalysts that might boost it, but I also understand the risk behind those plays - that value realization doesn't occur within a week - and that it's very possible that I lose all that cash. The way I build my portfolio to accommodate personal risk tolerances (and I'm pretty risk-inclined because a lot of this is ""play money"" for me) is I'll max my position size on a name to about 20%, I'll max my ""lotto tickets"" (e.g. faggy D's) to about 2%, and I'm happy using leverage or synthetic leverage, but I'll only buy options cheap (e.g. despite having strong views on TSLA, I'm not playing those options given how expensive they are).

At the end of the day, you'll learn a lot more through experience and what does and doesn't work according to your personal style than asking for advice. I lost almost $20k on KORS earnings a few days back, and in total that trade cost me $70k in opportunity costs... stung for a while and made me trade emotionally for a little bit, but, after getting my head on straight, I realized that my portfolio and the risk framework I had implemented accounted for the possibility of that loss occurring. Since then, I've been able to make about $50k of it back.

Hope this is somewhat helpful. Good luck.",wellbespoke,wallstreetbets,21.0

The inherent problems, however, won't be fixed. I don't see TSLA becoming FCF positive, especially not by Q3, so it *will* need to raise capital at some point. Some time in Q4 to early 2019 (definitely by Mar 2019 when their debt matures), this thing will drop to the low 200s at least. If they are able to raise dilutive capital, it means there's a greater fool out there, and that should stymie the bleeding somewhat, but, if it's unable to tap the capital markets at all (I only see it being able to raise dumb equity, as rates will have risen significantly in the next 6-9 months and the credit profile of TSLA has been downgraded), then this thing will go to 0.",wellbespoke,wallstreetbets,32.0

1,2018-06-08,"I completely agree with what you're saying - and I learned it the hard way in the past few months. I paid a lot of ""tuition"" to the options school of hard knocks. I said I would sell the TSLA call if it went to $300... it went so far above that, that I decided to let it ride. Last week I had a $280 TSLA call that I bought on the last dip 3 weeks back, so I thought I had an idea of how the stock price moved throughout the week. I saw a huge run up on last Friday afternoon for no reason, which I assumed was short covers. 

Anyway, for this situation, let's assume I sold my first ITM position yesterday though. That level of profit was insane, and it went so far beyond my sell price of $300 that I essentially had an extra $1,500 I wouldn't have had if I sold the option at my exit price. I thought it was going to squeeze, so I put 2/3 of this ""free"" money back into a call for next week at $327.5 @ $900

Basically I'm trying to figure out why there was such a huge run-up to $320 yesterday, then a huge run-up to $328+ this morning, then a huge sell-off the rest of the day. Like I said, I assumed a short squeeze was going to happen, so I decided if it hit $325 within the hour of market open, I would buy next week's call ATM and sell it tomorrow. 

So let's assume I didn't buy the $290 call., but decided to play the $327.5 6/15 this morning because the stock was up so much. What did I do wrong with buying a $327.5 TSLA call when the stock was at $326 this morning? What should I have been looking at? ",AlwaysPhillyinSunny,wallstreetbets,1.0

32,2018-06-12,"About a month ago, I wrote about (and provided screenshots for) [how I grew from $2,000 to $64,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8i3esy/started_w_2000_grew_it_to_64000_in_8_months/). This is a continuation of that post, where, over the past month, I gained about 200% and grew the account to $200k.

High level takeaways:

- Most of the gains were from IQ, KORS, SIG, IAC, and MTCH - positions changed and I went in and out of different spots over the past month, so I didn't provide specific position level detail here.

- I, at one point, lost $80k in combined realized/unrealized losses and opportunity costs (e.g. sold out of IQ too early to place a losing bet on KORS earnings), but have since made back about $60k of it quadrupling down on KORS

- I wrote up some posts detailing my strategies and thought processes if you're interested in digging through my post history. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8p2t0q/i_dont_belong_here_but_i_want_to/e08cp0g/?context=0) post is probably most comprehensive in terms of how I think about positions.

- In terms of what I'm playing today; I think this week has a lot of catalysts that can boost my existing positions, but I'll probably risk-off at the end of this week or early next week. I don't see too much more room to run in my current positions, and I don't see anything super compelling at the moment. I think AZO still has a bit to run and options are cheap enough where money can be made. I previously called SIG to $60, so that only leaves about 3% upside left. KORS I'm getting out at low $70s, at which point I expect it to stagnate a bit. I think IAC has a lot of long-term potential, as it trades lower than sum-of-parts, but it's more a stock play than an option play, since it struggles to break $160 resistance. I like YELP a lot, but will probably continue to monitor it over the next month before entering a position. My most prescient call was probably [TSLA to just under $400](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8p0vot/dont_buy_tesla_they_said_tesla_is_dead_they_said/e0819ns/) while the stock was still trading under $300; it's then jumped about 20% in the week since I made the post. Not playing it though, as options are super expensive... not a good risk/return imo.

- Random market call: I think KORS will acquire FOSL at some point. Maybe not imminently, as I think FOSL currently is very overvalued (would love to short it, but am waiting for an inflection point), but I think an acquisition is very very likely.",wellbespoke,wallstreetbets,32.0

You just saw a sweet picture of Elon Musk on WSB and you're going all in on TSLA right this second, but I saw the same picture and thought his jacket was too big so I'm selling. I place a limit sell at $342.95, you place yours at $343 in case it moves up. The program sees both orders, then very quickly buys my shares and sells them to you. They just cleared $0.05/share with essentially 0 risk (this is called an arbitrage opportunity). This is literally just first-come, first-serve free money so it's resulted in a crazy arms race to get physically shorter wires connecting their computers to the exchange computers.

You cannot compete in this market full stop, big institutions just get that money and they will forever, it's just an extra fee at this point. This isn't ideal, but it's also not some horrible evil. Arbitrage has a place, they are helping equalize prices around the world and creating liquidity. This light-speed iteration is just the perfection of a strategy that has existed since economies began. 

You're not competing with them though, there isn't some wizard behind a curtain drawing squiggly lines, these companies don't give a fuck what happens to the share price once they complete the trade. If you're right and everyone decides Elon Musk is the greatest CEO and the share price increases then you've still made money (after losing your pennies on the sale as well).

As an engineer myself I feel all in this field are drawn to challenges. I wonder if perhaps the challenge of actual autopilot is too impossible/disheartening to achieve. 

I've said this before that I love Tesla. They have great intentions and they really are the future. My boss owns a model X p100D and we launch it from time to time. I've test drove a model 3 and it is simple in a great way. But they drove their way to the top too fast with failed promises.

to name a few. They have an adaptive cruise control with lane assist like most luxury cars do these days and they got away with calling it autopilot.

Very often in options you can't get out when you want to because of the spread. It's a real risk, although TSLA should be so high volume it isn't an issue.

You need a platform that updates reasonably enough to use limit orders with fast market information. I do my trades through TDA's ThinkOrSwim (or the app version) and I haven't placed a market trade in years. They make it super easy to put limits at mid-range or at bid/ask limits, and updating isn't hard either. And not infrequently they get me a better fill than the price I asked for.

Better yet, one of the platforms (I believe Schwab though I'm guessing) has a feature where you can ask them to automatically adjust your price little by little if it doesn't fill in the first 5 minutes. So you place a limit and it will move to the market level to get you a fill.

Then I started dicking around with $TSLA and got up to $25K ($19.5K in tastyworks; $5.5K in my Robinhood Super-Duper-Extra-Fucky account) when it hit the $370-$380 range. Now I'm at around $13K ($8.9K in tw; $4.1K in Robinhood). My position is all 8/17 and 9/21 calls at various strikes (from $320 to $370), with the occasional weekly put to add a splash of green to my otherwise deep-red portfolio.

If you're going to play $TSLA, you better have balls of steel. You WILL spend at least a month at a time staring at 50% losses (so don't fucking buy weeklies). You WILL hate life. But it's worth it when the stock spikes harder than your blood pressure when you open the freezer and WTF MOM THERE ARE NO FUCKING CHICKEN TENDERS.

Buy calls, be patient, and you have a good shot at being showered in tendies. Keep some dry powder, too, so you have some flexibility to buy calls/puts as needed. And seriously, don't fucking buy weeklies.

The worst thing about all this? I don't even know what ticker I want to follow after the $TSLA drama plays out for the 92nd time. Few move like it. $AMD might be good, though. Their processor and GPU architectures are really starting to embarrass $INTC, apparently (and $NVDA?).

10,2018-07-08,"Well I'm late to the thread but you raise a very good question, actually. tl;dr - in this market, you're more correct than you realize. 

What you should realize about the stock market from, say, 2010 until now is that it has been **extremely** passive. What I mean by that is that huge money inflows have been directed into ETF's, which then just mechanically buy stocks with little eye to valuation since the ETF has rules to follow (track the S&amp;P, track the banking sector, etc). And with the Fed vomiting cash all over the world, there was little reason to second guess this strategy. For example, the only reason TSLA share price is where it's at is because giant mutual funds (Fidelity, T Rowe, etc) created funds which just happen to include TSLA, which everyone then bought (and held). This isn't necessarily abnormal - the market swings from majority-passive to majority-active regularly. When the market gets too passive, there can be money made in being the investor who bets on the ""correct"" share price - the more passive the market, the more opportunity there is to be ""active"". But this is where the phrase ""the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent"" comes from (see: david einhorn). So everyone kinda agrees with you, but if you're betting on a correction you gotta get the timing right, which is just as difficult than getting the price direction right.

Hell, even in a ""normal"" market the stock price is kinda BS. If you ever ran a standard DCF analysis, you have to deal with this wonky thing called the ""terminal value"". This is the cash flows that happen in the future beyond what you can reasonably estimate - say 10 years. So what analysts do is say, ok after 10 years this business will be at ""steady state"" so I can apply a growth percent of x% for the rest of time, then discount it back to present day. You kinda have to do this to make a DCF ""work"" mathematically, but in lots of cases the terminal value gets to be 40-50% of a stock's current price! So if you changed your steady state assumption, from, say 3% growth to 3.5% growth (which, really, who knows?) that has a massive implication on share price. And then you lop on some random P/E multiplier (should MU have a P/E multiplier of 5 or 10?), and it's just BS stacked upon BS. 

I'm starting to be of the opinion that the only valid long term strategy, besides Graham-style, is just to follow the Fed - when expansionary, just buy a whole ton of shit and let simmer for 5 years. When contracting (like it's starting to), set up bearish long term trades.

What is more important is that historical volatility (realized volatility) is lower than implied volatility. I would estimate that historical volatility is lower than implied volatility about 90% of the time.

As with finding assets with high IV, just remember that IV is relative. For example JNJ and TSLA. TSLA obviously has a higher IV but might not actually be better than JNJ because TSLA also has a very high historical volatility as well. What is usually a better indicator is when IV is higher than the average IV because IV tends to revert back to the mean. ",cocaobeans,wallstreetbets,2.0

it's not gud but it's better than the +/-$1k daily swings.  i took some losses on my FB and TSLA puts in the morning but had a slow comeback with the 3 long term plays i bought with the crumbs of my FDs.  i also infused $1k so you'll see the portfolio value went up from yesterday -- but trust, it was not due to gains :)

i took your advice which was largely:

GENERAL

\- stop buying FDs

\- buy at least 2.5+ months in the future

\- buy ITM/ATM

\- consolidate positions

SPECIFIC

\- drump my FB put FDs (wow, glad i did that early)

\- drump my TSLA put FDs

CHANGES

\- sold off $TQQQ calls for profit

\- drumped $FB and $TSLA put FDs

\- purchased $ROKU $43.0C 10/19 (2 contracts)

\- purchased $PYPL $82.5C 10/19 (1 contract)

\- purchased $AAPL $190C 10/19 (1 contract)

you'll notice $SBUX/$F/$GE puts -- i bought these a week or two ago, they just didn't fit on yesterday's screenshot.  pump or drump?

11,2018-07-10,"Great post.  Too bad people are going to miss the point and go long straddles.  

One item that I'd beg to differ on is the staying away from meme stocks.  They're meme's for a reason.  As long as you can find good liquidity in the 1SD region, meme stocks offer a hell of a lot of bang for the buck.  I know you mentioned that TSLA IV actually *under*estimates the realized vol of TSLA, and that may be true (I'm not good enough at math to know one way or the other), but again--as long as you stay far enough OTM, there is so much premium in TSLA that it (and other memestocks like it) make great strangle candidates.  Example:  this afternoon (with TSLA at $322), you could sell a 7/13 (*3 days!*) TSLA 285/360 strangle for $0.51. If you wanted to be smarter (and less of a WSBer), you could sell the 8/15 250/400 for $7.00!   

My point being:  I like selling premium on memes, because you get to profit off of everyone's lottery ticket purchases.  ",maxwellllll,wallstreetbets,11.0

I'm simply explaining to OP who I am responding to that he is not doing it just so his cult can worship him, but because that is the impact on the world he wants to have.  It's also his responsibility to balance his humanitarian desires and his capitalistic abilities so that his companies don't go bankrupt.

Since this is over, there just isn't much that will happen between now and 8/17 that will put TSLA below $250.  This is what is meant by the phrase IV Crush.  Your option before ER had some extra value because there was a chance that the ER would be terrible.  This is priced into the implied volatility.  

2) You were way out of the money to begin with, so you needed a massive move to put you in the money.  A small move in the right direction might have still lost you money.

4,2018-08-04,"First and foremost I’m here to shitpost . Making money is a side hobby

All of the price in tsla stock is based off of perceived potential: right now they’re burning cash and making huge losses and having levels of production orders of magnitude off of actual OEMs like GM and Ford. They keep saying they’ll get over the hump and become profitable soon and raise production levels to decent numbers but right now it’s just “soon”.

In the meantime every other automaker is catching up into what made Tesla unique: they have their own luxury EVs coming out and they can actually meet demand. Tesla’s only other niche besides EVs was autonomous driving, but they’re quickly losing that race. GM supercruise is already better than autopilot and they’re not the only OEM with something similar. Elon keeps selling snake oil with his Level 4 promises while Waymo and Nutonomy are actual in the final stages of validation.

Tesla may have a lot of hype but they’ve lost their chance to pass the hump while still maintaining g their niche in the market. They may become a sustainable OEM but they’re certainly not going to put a dent into existing major OEMs and the hype will catch up to the stock",orthofort,wallstreetbets,4.0
5,2018-08-04,"A short squeeze is where a large number of people hold short positions which they are forced to close at a loss because the price is going up. In closing their position, they are also buying shares and thus forcing the price up more. Heavily shorted stocks like TSLA are thus prone to large spikes during a short squeeze.

A short squeeze is like the opposite of panic selling. It's people who held a short position panic buying to cut their losses. ",Safety_first_friends,wallstreetbets,5.0
6,2018-08-04,"If the calls you sell are out of the money the whole time, there’s no way you’ll be assigned. If they do end up in the money you’re still gonna have a chance at the share price dropping before expiration. If they are in the money and you do get assigned, your max loss is: ((current share price - strike price) x 100) - premium received, because you’re selling covered calls.

Example: Your avg cost is $307. Say you sold an 8/3 $325 call before earnings. Today at close you get assigned on that contract. TSLA closed at $347. So, because you got assigned, you lose 100 shares, but in return you gain $32,500 (100 x strike price). However, if you hadn’t been assigned, you’d still have your 100 shares, which at close were worth $34,700. So you effectively lost $2,200 (ignoring whatever you got as a premium) in potential profits. Now, that doesn’t factor in your average cost. Basically, you bought those 100 shares for $30,700 and sold them for $32,500, so you *still made $1,800 in capital appreciation* (which would have been $4,000 if you hadn’t been assigned).

Now, obviously, the goal is to just not get assigned. That way you get your premium and your full capital appreciation. You can sell far OTM calls and get low risk, low reward premiums, or ATM calls for high risk moderate reward. You could sell them ITM too, if you want a fat premium, but, of course, ITM means you could be assigned. You’d probably only want to do that if you’re reasonably sure the underlying will drop significantly before expiration; at that point you could either buy to close or get assigned and let your premium make up for your loss.

So, to cap up: you’re selling covered calls, which limits your max loss. If your strike price is above your average cost on the 100 shares, you will make money on capital appreciation.

7,2018-08-04,"You own 600 TSLA shares that are worth $348 each. On Monday morning, you go sell six 9/21 $375 calls (representing about a 7% gain above your current position). You will collect about $1150 for each contract (around 3.3% cash gain on your current position). If TSLA falls between now and then, your basis is 3.3% better than it would’ve been without selling the calls. If TSLA closes beyond your $375 strike, you get to sell your shares at that 7% above what you currently own them at level, AND you pocket your additional 3.3% premium. You can then turn around and sell puts on the other side and either keep the cash, or get assigned if it drops to your strike. 

Your fear is probably but what if TSLA is worth 30% more than it is now, and I don’t get to cash in on that??  Tough shit, you still got to sell at 10% better than your current state 6 weeks from now.  And if it doesn’t print above your strike by 9/21, then you just do the exact same thing next month at a similar strike above the current price. ",maxwellllll,wallstreetbets,7.0

25,2018-08-03,"I think it's interesting that it kind of mirrors the electric car phenomenon. The concept that led to the current duopoly of smartphones was first commercialized by a company called Danger with their HipTop. MS tried to buy danger, but was outmaneuvered by google who got the ""real"" company to form Android. Once Android was a proven company, google bought it for a bill.  
  
MS drove the remains of Danger straight into the ground, and then stomped and mashed on it by briefly releasing the Kin before getting suckered into the nokia deal. Both MS and Nokia discouraged their own innovation in remarkably stupid ways.  
  
This thing sort of mirrors how GM had the ev1 long ago, and eventually they've got the Volt and the Bolt, but they're like the Zune of cars, at least in terms of public perception.

It's also not just shorts and margin calls. Somebody sold call options and they might be cash secured, meaning when those calls expire the seller needs to have the stock on hand to settle.

15,2018-08-06,"Look... I'm going to give you a very stupid analysis right now.

There is a singular driver of health care money: Surgery. 

Surgery happens because of dumb organ systems. Dumb systems can be operated on with relative ease. 

Whats a dumb system?

The heart is. and the joints are. pretty much everything except smart systems...

whats a smart system? Well. You have three brains. 

1. Brain brain. Your CNS in your brain, and your spinal cord, to a lesser extent. 

2. Gut brain. Your intestines doin dat work all day to take all the horseshit you guzzle, and turn it into sweet tendies inside of you. They are seriously magical and have magic immunology reservoirs of unicorn value that keep your body protected from invisible demons that make you fat and broken and sick. Eat more fruit and veg. 

3. Your immuno/endocrine brain. This includes your pancreas, thyroid, sexybits, lymph, leuk, kidney-hats, and their respective hormones. They meanmug the fuck out of all the nasties and kill them with fire. They also control how you feel, day to day. Reciprocate respect and you shall be respected. 

Now.. traders often know that biotech and pharma are honeypots but they cant hit the target about how the future will play out in terms of what to invest in... I havent found any MSFT of the biotech world get talked about nearly like TSLA FB and MU do on this sub. 

What I'm telling you is, hospitals make the bank on the surgeries. That market is tapped and largely not driven by recommendation as much as it is it necessity. its inflexible. theres no, 'well, try the surgery and see if you like it!' .. no return policy. people shop surgeons but theres no surgeon to invest in... theres also no insight into investing in the best docs or hospital systems... the market there is hard to tap because of shade/mist in a consistent way for traders, is what im saying. The hospitals will keep making bank for themselves on the surgeries on the dumb systems.
 
But


If you find companies that use pills to support/nurture any of the smart systems, you'll be in a much more transparent market, where you can actually track how many diabetics there are, how many buy which pills, shifts in the market, etc, and folks that find drugs that work for them will invest in that drug for years.

I wouldn't be surprised at all if he were to suddenly change his mind about selling, then after TSLA drops, turn around and offer some fantastic news in order to benefit the long term holders. 

EDIT: A lot of people chiming in why entity a/b/c *wouldn't* buy or why Musk wouldn't sell to them. You're missing the point - so long as Musk can legally point to some kind of legitimate ability to sell his company, he can *claim* to be considering it. And then he do whatever he wants including changing his mind. So the net result on the shortsellers/nags would be:

talk about selling: price goes up - shorts get fucked


decide against selling: price drops (company is now free of short sellers)

new low price offers calmer, more loyal investors a chance to pick up shares: they buy up because they believe in Musk's vision

come out with some amazing news: price go back up but now with more loyal investors

151,2018-08-07,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to invest in $TSLA. Its quarterly losses are extremely non-subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the financial reports will go over a typical investor's head. There's also Elon's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. $TSLA investors understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these cars' features, to realise that they're not just about autopilot- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike $TSLA truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Elon's existential catchphrase "" We're going to be in production hell,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenevs Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Elon Musk's genius wit unfolds itself on his livestreams. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a $TSLA tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎",SaintMarinus,wallstreetbets,151.0

154,2018-08-07,"Amazon is using them to attack Facebook bruh. They sent them an autistically capable CFO exec after Q1 results disappointed... and made them put in programmable ads. Also they were up Q3 17 until they shot themselves in the foot by the design controversy. They fixed it and google trends for “Snapchat redesign sucks” cut off after May15 re- redesign (fixing stories and messages). Everyone uses it, ads are cheap, and the sector is only down because Facebook and Twitter are hit by privacy/bot scandal... whereas Snap has basically amazing privacy comparably and no bot problem. MSM is also not railing against Snap for “Russian interference”. Overall, Jeff Bezos would probably acquire Snap but the stock voting structure means he had to incorporate it via partnerships and personnel overlap instead. Only execs insider selling are departed board members who got kicked out between Q3 17 and Q1 18. Evan is a sperg but he’s not stupid, they make innovative products. And as Elon said in TSLA earning call... slightly paraphrasing... “moats are an outdated strategy... continual innovation is actually the best way to compete”. Kids also still use Snapchat and they use Instagram to post their snap photos. Aka snap isn’t going anywhere. It is also fixing its android app (where its rating is 4.5/5) and expanding overseas... probably because Amazon told them to do it (tinfoil lol). This is huge, Evan used to say that only rich western kids should use Snap, but since Q1 they released new versions and grew overseas (by Snapmap usage comparisons). Apple also shills for them because of ARkit, and spectacles aside their filter game and playful tools are unmatched in the industry. And last of all.. Keeping up with Kardashians season 15 promotional material started appearing in June/July 18 and the season started August 5th— and they love to use Snap, their insta is basically just their snap reposted.

13,2018-08-09,"The price you pay for the option (so the value of the option) includes a measurement of volatility (basically price movement uncertainty). SNAP's uncertainty was very very high, so the options were much more expensive than they would have been compared to an all-else-equal stock with low uncertainty. After earnings, the uncertainty decreased significantly, which means the value of your options decreased significantly, because people are now more certain on the direction SNAP's price will go. This makes their resale value a lot lower. 

The same thing will happen with TSLA. Due to the merger news, it has very high IV. TSLA options are therefore very expensive right now, and as soon as the merger news drops (for or against), they will all drop in value. By buying a TSLA option, you're betting the price change will be so large it will cancel out the high price you paid for that uncertainty.

Then there's an unknown percentage owned by Tesla employees who will probably be incentivized to hold onto their stock in the private company. I'd be surprised if more than 30%-40% of the public shares are sold if/when they go private (all of the shorts plus a sizeable part of the small investor longs who prefer to keep their stock investments more liquid).

Well, I can't say I blame you for your outlook on TSLA if this is your viewpoint, but this is pretty much where teams diverge. The years I've spent (somewhat successfully) in tech investing points to TSLA becoming fundamentally different than the incumbents, which is what TSLA bulls are betting on. 

I don't think we need to dive into those differences, because no doubt you've heard -- and refuted -- a long list of them.

Illiquidity is relative. No, it's not the NYSE, but no doubt there will be ample interest during the scheduled buy/sell periods. The stock doesn't just *go away* to make it suddenly illiquid.

There's also Elon's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. $TSLA investors understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these cars' features, to realise that they're not just about autopilot- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike $TSLA truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Elon's existential catchphrase "" We're going to be in production hell,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenevs Russian epic Fathers and Sons.

18,2018-08-10,"Proof/screenshots and write-ups detailing the climb in previous posts:

[Original post: $2,000 to $64,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8i3esy/started_w_2000_grew_it_to_64000_in_8_months/)

[First  update: $2,000 to $200,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8qkv93/from_2000_to_200000/)

In the past two months, my positions have gained to just over $400,000. I really wanted to wait until I hit half a million to make an update post, but I'm probably going to de-risk a lot (I think Q1 2019 will have a lot of catalysts, which is probably when I'll re-enter), so this will likely be the last update for a while:

- Winning positions were YELP, IAC, and AZO (basically the same positions I noted I was playing in the [fourth bullet of my previous comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8qkv93/from_2000_to_200000/e0jxaso/)). KORS almost made me a ton of money, but came out to be a wash/small gain due to the June trade war bullshit. Lost about $50k on my shorter-term contracts, but made that back on my longer-term contracts in the past couple of days after earnings.

- As mentioned previously, I'm not too bullish on the overall market going forward. I'll have most of my risk off the table by the end of the month. I have small plays in NVDA and AMAT earnings, but not much else that's too compelling. I think the market might climb through the rest of the month, but with increased volatility, then stagnate through year-end. I think heightened trade war tensions might create short-term downside vol, but nothing sustaining (hence the stagnation through year end). I believe the real negative catalyst will be sustained effects of rising interest rates, which seems to have been forgotten or buried in the past few months. I'm hoping to load up on downside bets around EOY or early 2019.

- I'm guessing there's been a lot of discussion on TSLA around here, but I haven't read any of it, so here are my thoughts: TSLA will never go private. There's not a financier insane enough finance that deal. As a comparison, JWN (which is actually profitable) tried to go private last year, on Baa1 rating at about $9bn market cap, which required ""only"" a $2bn capital raise, WITH the backing of one of the most respected consumer/retail PE firms in the world, yet was unable to secure financing at an acceptable cost. Do you really think any bank is going to finance a $70bn mkt cap (at proposed $420 take-private price) Caa1 junk company that is burning through cash? It astounds me that TSLA would bounce so much on a random Musk tweet, which have been proven time and again to be nothing more than Elon's whims and fantasies, and severely out of touch with reality. This is further exacerbated by the fact that the existing bonds, currently trading well under par, have a CoC clause allowing bondholders to put the bonds at 101. The whole situation is such a circus. The only situation I see this potentially materializing is if SoftBank or one of the Saudi entities with too much cash to throw around decides to entertain the idea just for clout. Despite my pessimism, I hope it can stay bouyed for the next few months, because the combination of rising rates, maturing debt (Mar 19), inaccessibility to capital markets, and uncontrollable cash-burn will lead to the perfect storm of a very severe correction around the time I'm hoping the markets will turn aroud.

- To answer common questions that came up after my previous post: 1. My background is in IB, HF, and PE, with the majority of my experince in PE 2. I don't have any reading recommendations or suggestions on how to learn. Bascially everything I know about and all the tools I use when investing, I picked up on the job. 3. I don't have any thoughts on random XYZ ticker that you DM me. I have a very small universe of tickers that I keep apprised of, and those are the only tickers I know intimately well. 4. My style is a hybrid approach; screen for fundamentals, and monitor 'technicals' and potential catalysts for entries. I don't have much else to say on how/what I screen for, etc.",wellbespoke,wallstreetbets,18.0

Y'all gave me great advice last time such as ""take it out and pay it off before you regret it,"" ""sell your AMD it's gonna crash,"" ""Starbucks is a bad short"" and other goodies. Well, good for me I didn't listen to you. In fact, I made almost all of this explicitly ignoring WSB consensus (except for getting burned for a few k on MU earnings).

[Elon 2: Electric Boogaloo](https://i.imgur.com/KD31eVA.png)

[MTCH](https://i.imgur.com/s3bcvU8.png)

*All of these are positions are realized except for AMD and a bit of MTCH calls*

**Tree, should I go take out a loan and do this too?**

No, hell no. Please don't. I don't trust any of you. Taking out a loan won't magically make you a good trader. I had already practiced swing trading with success before taking out the loan, and still did not touch options until I had another full year of experience. Additionally, while the account was small, I was very careful with position sizing and hedging, as well as having backup cash in another account so *I was never at risk of a default*. In fact, before going on my run vertical, I was less than $1000 away from hitting the point where I planned to liquidate everything, pay off the loan, and take the loss. The stress ain't worth it. I got lucky. This ain't in the spirit of WSB but I'd rather see this sub filled with more +$400k guys and less -99% guys.

**Are you gonna pay off the rest of loan right now?**

No.

**What are my next plays?**

I don't have any ready and waiting in the wings. I'm probably gonna sell a lot and take a chill pill until something shows itself. Timing the market beats time in the market, and you can't time the market without patience. That said, might play WMT earnings (long) depending on how it develops and I'm waiting for a good time to enter MU so aggressively that it'll make subae jealous.",treefiddy_cent,wallstreetbets,35.0

21,2018-08-12,"Yeah, this is my first time playing options, so I'm trying to keep it simple and not do any paired options. Along with my direct short position, I do have puts for January 2019 and January 2020. I have also sold a small number of calls for both of those as well.

The biggest advantage of the puts is great effective leverage: if they hit, the payoff is huge. The biggest advantage of the calls is that I can win without TSLA going to zero (and, presuming they don't get far enough out to margin call me, I should fairly easily break even or win a bit just from the stock not going up as much as it could have).

The biggest problem with the puts is that the company needs to go all the way down basically for me to hit. The biggest problem with the calls is they hit the hardest when TSLA pumps.

So, while I haven't run detailed numbers for various situations, my hope is basically I'd be about break-even if TSLA is break-even, win a bit if TSLA goes down a bit, and hit it big if they go bankrupt.

Of course, if TSLA really ends up getting sold for or sustaining $420 or above I'll have some losses, but I still think bankruptcy is the most likely outcome.",coinaday,wallstreetbets,21.0

The greeks is extremely important, and without a solid grasp of theoretical economics most of the trades will go over a typical investor's head. There's also Buffet's pragmatic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Benjamin Graham literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these economics, to realise that they're not just profitable- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Options Trading truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Buffet's addiction to Coke-a-Cola  which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons.

After all it’s still one generation of BMW vs one generation of TSLA.

Car people don’t compare a “1999 3 series to a 2003 3 series”. It’s an E36 vs an E46”

By the end of 2018, close to 100 million so-called light vehicles — cars and trucks designed to carry passengers and moderate amounts of cargo — will get sold.

Almost all of them will be powered by petroleum, either gasoline or diesel. How many is almost all? That would be 99%. EV sales should come in at around 1%.

40,2018-09-08,"No, option premiums also depend on implied volatility (IV). This value increases when the market expects the stock price to change, or if the stock has been more volatile in the past. People who issue options contracts need to ensure they get higher premiums for stocks that are presumed to move more wildly.

For example, the relatively stable stock $MSFT has 9/21 calls trading around 20% implied volatility. $TSLA calls expiring on the same date have IV around 57%.

Now to more fully answer your question, IV can differ between calls and puts on the same stock if the market has a bias toward one direction. $TSLA 9/21 puts have IV around 66%, and thus are more expensive than the calls. Here, the option writers have more bias toward $TSLA moving downward. A good example of when this difference is more pronounced is on the ex-dividend date. On the ex-div date, the stock is presumed to move down the same amount of the dividend that's being issued (to account for the company giving away ""free"" money). In this case, puts expiring on/after the ex-div date are more expensive and calls are cheaper. ",NeutralRedditor_,wallstreetbets,40.0

Once the gigafactories are up and running and Model S/3/X are bootin' along, Tesla will have a surplus of battery packs which can then be used to fulfil powerwall orders and lead the world in portable storage revolution.

Lol, no shit about mpg, Tesla doesnt make ICE cars.

And no, no other EV has more range than a tesla. The fact that you got 2 easy things wrong, proves your other points are useless.

They are also at a negative revenue because they spend most of their money on infrastructure and RnD. You have to have a fast charging network and service centers before you start mass producing EVs.

1,2018-09-12,"I felt like the weed part was pre-planned for some kind of PR reason, and the whole interview was setting up for that moment.

The whiskey drinking, the mentions of weed here and there, and then finally the fake hit followed immediately by Musk explaining that he doesn’t even like it and never really smokes it. 

And if I remember correctly, the joint disappears after that. It’s not even like Rogan continued to smoke it. 

I really can’t figure out the angle they are going for, but it definitively looked staged to me. 

One possibility I’m thinking for all the ‘bizarre’ behavior is that it is part of a plan for Musk to leave TSLA. All the craziness is to slowly allow the market to prepare and accept this as inevitable, especially considering Musk’s importance to TSLAs vision. 

The other possibility is that they are trying to desensitize people to his eccentric behavior, because if you listen to the interview, the guy is a genius.  ",ballinisahabit,wallstreetbets,1.0
2,2018-09-12,"Really tough, depends how you entered them and account sizing. For example in my main account I like to do an initial entry of ~12k-20k for a single position (assuming it isn't more of a 'gamble' play where I'll risk less but expect more %). With that, I'll be willing to add another 6k-10k if it moves against me but I still like it. I don't mean I'm down 5% after a few minutes, I mean a few days or so where overall market conditions draga position but underlying view/DD hasn't changed. Thinking you will time markets perfectly will drive you mad (and bankrupt). Certain tickers just require more capital to really have fun with (AMZN, TSLA) but this is speaking to my general average positions. 

One example that gives me more breathing room is I love to enter a position with verticals. ATVI was one such play. I knew I was very bullish on it after its earnings (I did not play earnings). Gave it the pre-requisite couple day wait for things to settle out and bought my 72.5C and sold the 85C (all for November) when the underlying was ~$70.5x. We got a nice move up and I just let it sit. Of course I am losing money on the 85C that I sold, but gaining more on the 72.5's and I already know my max profit ($1,250-cost of vertical * number of contracts) so I don't really worry. Well, sure enough that bullshit analyst ""muh fortnite!"" report came out and ATVI dropped ~$2.50 overnight. Nothing changed in my view (and some 'analyst' being bearish only further affirmed my bullish outlook). This also dropped right in the middle of more tariff fud and overall market lethargy. The nice thing about this is that I was able to wait a day and make sure ATVI found some footing and I bought back the 85C I sold for a profit (I sold them to someone else and then bought them back from the market later for less money). This alleviated a lot of position stress because I was able to recoup some losses and give myself significantly more breathing room on the long side. Because I also was still bullish and felt ATVI was being unfairly beat up by negativity surrounding EA/""tariffs"" and massively overstated support for Fortnite, I added to my long 72.5C position after I closed the sold 85C. Since that day ATVI has posted 4 green closes. Yesterday I started to work out of the 62 contracts I had. I sold a small chunk (12, I believe) to lock some gains in and more importantly get the position sizing back within my ""comfort zone"" (at the height, I had about $28k just in long ATVI contracts). Today I unloaded a further 40 contracts after such a fantastic day. I still firmly believe they'll test ATH/break out but I'm happy to let just 10 deep ITM contracts covering the next ER report time-frame ride and not even think twice about them or fret over them unless it breaks ATH in the next 2 days. I'll further shave a few and then just set alerts for it pulling back some so I can re-enter. 

Of course, I would have made more cash if I had just said ""FUCK IT, YOLO ALL IN"" and bought all 62 Nov 72.5C's on day 1, but it would have been a HELL of a lot tougher to sit there watching my $28k position down -$10k after 48 hours. Instead, I was never down more than roughly 3-4k due to staggered entries and selling further OTM calls. Due to this, the position moves didn't happen immediately so I felt I could still safely control and monitor with a clear head and not be tempted to emotionally trade.

49,2018-10-02,"I don't have a position on TSLA right now. I don't trade it frequently, because it does irrational crazy shit.

A few points though:

* You don't need to believe a company is going to go bankrupt to short it. You can just believe it's way overvalued
* The stock going up doesn't prove that shorts are irrational, any more than a stock going down doesn't prove that investors are irrational. There's a spectrum of possible futures, but only one can actually happen. If I say ""I think there's a decent chance this roll of the die doesn't result in a six"" and place a bet on it, but a six gets rolled, that doesn't make me irrational. Sometimes unlikely shit happens. That's why it's called unlikely, not impossible.

I'm going to assume you asked in good faith though, and make a bit of the bear case. My understanding of the short thesis is that there are a few catalysts that might drive the stock significantly lower:

* Tesla has [a $920 million 0.25% convertible issue](https://www.barrons.com/articles/tesla-stocks-surge-puts-convertible-bonds-in-the-money-1533667505) due Feb. 27, 2019, which would be convertible into common at a price of $359.8676 per share. If $TSLA is trading below that, they'll have to pay back that nearly-billion-dollars in cash. That'll be a huge hit to their sheet.
* Similarly, $1.4B in convertible bonds are due in early 2021 with similar terms.
* Musk has promised both [profitability and positive cash-flow](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/13/elon-musk-tweets-late-at-night-tesla-will-be-profitable-and-cash-flow-positive.html) in both quarters of 2H 2018. A failure to hit those metrics will put further pressure on Musk via the board to be more restrained in his forward-looking statements. A TSLA without bombastic growth promises is not a $50B TSLA, as no DCF or industry comp analysis prices it there without some *aggressive* growth assumptions
* A debt raise will be difficult and expensive for TSLA, as bonds are rated as B-.
* An equity raise will almost certainly force those convertible notes to be paid as cash, rather than equity, due to dilution.
* In 2019, competition will be entering the market with Jaguar and Mercedes entering at the high end. These challenge Tesla's more profitable models, putting downward pressure on both volume and margin.
* All of this tight cash in 2019 means they will not have the funding to open up new plants. That means the Semi is vaporware, and there isn't significant upside on the production side of things for existing models. By 2020, the Model S &amp; X will start to show that they're a bit long in the tooth, and so the plant will need to be re-tooled to update the body styles. This further diverts from actual growth opportunities.

I also don’t think he had any meaningful buyout talks with the Saudis, meaning funding was never secured. His tweet explicitly said “funding secured”, making that a total lie.

I think Elon is a visionary, but traders and investors are (rightfully) concerned about things like quarterly performance. It’s really the only quantitative measure we have as to the *true* happenings at the company.

I’m a cynic though. I assume that anything isn’t submitted to the SEC in a filing is exaggerated or fudged in some way; I just don’t believe a lot of press releases and speculation. Obviously I pay attention to those more qualitative takes, I usually take them with a grain or two of salt.

Everyone’s strategy is different. I’m comfortable because I’m in leaps and not short terms. The TSLA bears are very fervent. I have faith I will make a profit off these puts.",daddydunc,wallstreetbets,58.0

He added 20%, which *is* a common acquisition premium, and then rounded by a $1. Was it a stupid reason to round because it's funny? Yes, but it was funny that that was his reason. Not anything to be mad about.

The things that make him a great visionary/product leader aren't the best for short term quarterly profits. I just think with all that he's built, it's stupid to bet against him just because you don't like him as a person. That said, I've made $ off TSLA puts and calls; just more from the calls, so be careful out there.",smallfrys,wallstreetbets,61.0

63,2018-10-02,"01:03 PM EDT, 10/01/2018 (MT Newswires) -- Tesla (TSLA) achieved record production of about 80,000 electric vehicles in Q3, almost as many as the output of the last two quarters combined, Electrek reported Monday, citing a source familiar with the matter.
Electrek reported Friday that with two days to go in Q3, Tesla already achieved its Model 3 production goal at 51,000 units, with total production of 77,400 units. The company reportedly produced over 2,000 units in the last two days, bringing the quarterly total to about 80,000 electric vehicles.
Among the 80,000 units are 53,000 Model 3 vehicles, representing a 187% increase in production compared to Q2.
According to Electrek, Q3 was Tesla's ""most impressive quarter to date in terms of production,"" but the quarter's deliveries may be even higher, predicted at about 85,000 vehicles that will be more than double Tesla's previous record.

Now let’s compare this with another American car company, General Motors. Today, it’s market cap is about 48 billion dollars, which is higher than Tesla’s, but TSLA has been valued higher generally for the better part of almost two years now. GM sold 10 million cars and trucks worldwide, which is, not 10, but ONE HUNDRED TIMES more automobiles than TSLA. 

If you wanna take out the premium, and factor in TSLA’s supercharger network (which is easy to duplicate with money; nothing super nuanced about it. It’s a graph theory problem.), their self driving technology (which is more proprietary than their supercharger network, but can still be duplicated or exceeded by companies like Wayne) and their energy business in SolarCity, I’d say the market cap should still be less than 20 billion, which puts the stock at around $150.

Tesla already has no money and they lost 23 million dollars and for some reason everyone thinks that less shittier news than expected = good news when it comes to TSLA. then stock went right back to where it was.

0,2018-10-08,"I mean I somewhat take a problem with the consistent 30% growth rate as well. Growing from 5 billion to 10 billion in a nearly trillion dollar industry is far from outrageous; however, going from 10 Billion to 600 Billion in 10 years is actually stupid....like, just no. 

The number one reason I have an issue with that is because other manufacturers are still trying to work on their own electric vehicle ideas, and because Tesla has always been considered a luxery vehicle, companies such as Ford or Chevy (or even one of the Asian manufactures) could really take advantage of this market if they make a truly affordable, comfortable electric vehicle.

Tesla at $600 Billion in 10 years basically states that they have taken nearly 50% (Complete estimate, I obviously have no idea how big the car industry will be in 10 years) of the car industry, the adoption rate of electric vehicles in the global population will be a MINIMUM of 50% (Or whatever Tesla's actual market share is at that time) since that is all Tesla produces, and all other manufacturers gotta wave the white flag.

Just to finish this long comment, let me leave you with a little fundamental valuation of other auto makers using their 5 Year CAGR (For comparison of major auto companies once you reach a certain point in revenue):

F: 0.42%
TM: 0.90%
GM: -1.38%
FCAU: 3.40%
TSLA: 103% in 2016 to 59.13% in 2018

MU calls - lowest its been since shitty guidance is ~$41 and support appears to be strong at ~$42.50. At current share price looks like its primed for another pump and dump.  Since ER has been up between $45-47 a couple times before quickly dropping again.

40,2018-10-08,"This is actually something I brought up in Futurology awhile back and I got absolutely annihilated for it.

Their case is that TSLA has spent billions perfecting their tech and cars and are generations ahead of other makers and no other maker could ever catch up.

I simply can’t believe that a Toyota (who has &gt;20x revenue of TSLA and is actually profitable) or a VW who could spend billions without too much stress, couldn’t “catch up” eventually.  Will TSLA’s multi-year advantage work be a big help?  Absolutely, but even if TSLA is profitable in the next few years, it’ll take years, possibly decades, to have the same financial clout that Toyota has right now, and if Toyota keeps on being Toyota well, they’re going to be even higher.  Beyond that Toyota (and other giant makers) have perfected the art of building brand new plants that can spit out 300k+ vehicles per year in just a few years.  And we still don’t know how the long term durability of the new mass produced TSLA’s will be like; if they can go a full model cycle with building 5k cars per week without exceeding a major makers recall rate I will be impressed.

It’ll be an interesting decade.

All that said *if* TSLA turns a profit soon, there’s probably more money to be made going long on them over the next 5-10 years versus trying to ride Toyota because TSLA might double in value stock wise (or “just” go up 50% even) whereas Toyota might go up 15-20% in the next few years.

&gt; The number one reason I have an issue with that is because other manufacturers are still trying to work on their own electric vehicle ideas, and because Tesla has always been considered a luxery vehicle, companies such as Ford or Chevy (or even one of the Asian manufactures) could really take advantage of this market if they make a truly affordable, comfortable electric vehicle.
&gt; Tesla at $600 Billion in 10 years basically states that they have taken nearly 50% (Complete estimate, I obviously have no idea how big the car industry will be in 10 years) of the car industry, the adoption rate of electric vehicles in the global population will be a MINIMUM of 50% (Or whatever Tesla's actual market share is at that time) since that is all Tesla produces, and all other manufacturers gotta wave the white flag.
&gt; Just to finish this long comment, let me leave you with a little fundamental valuation of other auto makers using their 5 Year CAGR (For comparison of major auto companies once you reach a certain point in revenue):
&gt; F: 0.42% TM: 0.90% GM: -1.38% FCAU: 3.40% TSLA: 103% in 2016 to 59.13% in 2018

Not sure if you are familiar with the Financial Education channel but I think this guy is responding to the arbitrary price target of $3000 plus that of some analysts.

I’m excited to drive the new European EV’s but so far TSLA is the best car I’ve ever driven. I’m confident it will be around for a while. 

Toyota will however do very well in the affordable classes and will outcompete TSLA. I don’t think we’ll ever see a sub $35k vehicle from TSLA, meanwhile Toyota could enter in at that range and steal a big chunk of the market.

No, you gave one explanation. Another is that a capital raise isn't permitted while under SEC investigation. And there is still a separate one beyond the $420 tweet.

&gt;He doesn’t wasn’t to dilute his ownership.

But it's about the clean energy mission, right? I'm confused -- why would Musk do what's good for Musk only when he wants to save the world?

&gt;They could also get a bank loan to finance the model Y production line.

Where are they going to build it? Fremont is full.

&gt;I agree Tesla is way overvalued. 

Then why are you long Tesla? This is contradictory.

I actually want Tesla to succeed too, I think it's good for the planet and the U.S. auto industry. So I'm ""long"" in that sense, but definitely NOT long TSLA stock at $250.

* Shares down ~~2%~~ 2.5% today in reaction to the sales report. SUVs might be selling but overall the company's performance didn't quite meet expectations.
* There are consumer auto threats on the horizon such as ridesharing and long-term auto loans which may weaken auto demand in the future. In addition, a flood of lease returns originated during low interest rate periods means new autos will have to complete with depreciated, lightly used vehicles in the next few years.
* As noted by lurkering101, spike in crude prices poses a risk of impacting demand for new (ICE) SUVs.
* Even though EVs aren't quite yet at cost parity with similar ICE vehicles (netting out subsidies), the act of going through these motions show investors that management is serious about strategic transitions to the future. $F is behind both $GM and $TSLA here.
* Ford has not yet begun production of any electric trucks. Even Elon has been better at meeting promises of producing EVs.
* Rising risk-free rate negatively impacts competitive dividend yield, and risk of dividend cut during recessionary periods.

They took a rather big hit recently because of tariffs. I would only play $F long if you believe the trade war will be resolved before the next recession hits. Hope the VW partnership brings good news as well.

The biggest TSLA bulls welcome competition, as TSLA is poising itself to profit on the overall energy revolution, not just being a successful automotive mfg company. 

The book *Zero to One* by Peter Thiel (Yes, the tech guy the media villified) will explain this concept in simple yet thorough detail (not Tesla exclusively, but tech companies in general) What their *end-game* platform represents and how 99% of people do not look at it until it's too late.

For the rest of you still trading these options, please know this is not investing. These are not instruments designed to make you money. These are insurance contracts meant to hedge risk. Like all insurance it is priced well above the expected payout. When you are buying naked calls and puts you are doing nothing different than if you took tens of thousands to the casino and bet it all. Most of you would know not to do that. But it seems with derivatives people are giving themselves false justification by claiming they are traders and investors who are engaged in money making activity. But this is wrong. If you want to gamble go to the Casino, at least there you will know that you are gambling and hopefully have the good sense not to see it as some sure thing money making opportunity you should put your life savings into. 

For those who are really young and want to take some risk and live dangerously, stick to just buying the stocks. If you buy stocks like AMD, SQ, TSLA and other growth stocks you are actually investing and have a good chance. The market every day prices in all the info available for you. So each day the prices are fair and give you a good chance to get the 10% or so return they are pricing in each day.

4,2018-12-09,"&gt;You aren't even legally allowed to buy a Tesla in ohio. Why would Elon ever operate a factory there?

Dangling the perspective of opening up shop there seems like a good way to get some momentum in turning that around. 

Add a huge amount of media attention, states doling huge tax incentives being the new trend, I could totally see some politician using this as an opportunity to come out looking like a savior. 

For Elon, just like the thailand rescue stuff, I imagine he has a raging boner at the thought of coming out as the hero and all the free press that would come with it. He also would have them bent over the barrel in terms of negotiating terms for tax incentives, since they need him much more than he needs them.

15,2018-12-11,"I learned the hard lesson too may times to not chase. I always get burned when chasing so I am staying away from $ENR until it has a huge dip. It will then likely go to $52.  


I do a lot of bollinger band analysis and look for stocks that crossed below the bottom band and then buy, hold, and set sell target for middle bollinger band price. That's how I identified $ENR.  


I bought Alaska Air $ALK today using that technique. Price target for now is $65.50. But it may drop all the way to $61.50 before bouncing. Always hard to time the bottom.  


$TSLA crossed top bollinger band today so chances are good it will sell-off to $328 or so, but Tesla tends to defy any sort of TA so not touching that one.",bboyneko,wallstreetbets,15.0

I'm really fucking sad I didn't buy an amazon straddle at close. I rode it up to 1697 then sold before it dropped.

3,2018-12-12,"Correct me if I am wrong. In a purely ideal world where the future implications are completely disregarded, a stock “should be worth” a P/E of 1. Then, when you consider the future (possible growth) then a stock “should” be traded for more. Graham notes than between 1980 and 2000, only those stocks with P/E 20 or lower gave the most ROI. This is based on the assumption that the specific market the stock operates in would grow in such a way that makes the stock also grow. That’s why it’s reasonable for weed stocks to have a P/E greater than 20 because of the future possibilities of complete legalization. It’s also why people still believed in TSLA even when it never made a cent of profit for years. I think MU is valued at an accurate P/E purely because of the sector it is in: DRAMs (75% of its revenue). There’s no future possibility here that would warrant a step-change increase in revenue. That is, it’s met it’s ultimate promise. Thoughts?",Transracialfaggot,wallstreetbets,3.0
4,2018-12-12,"Yea, you're doing well. You might actually make it out of the big green machine alive.

I still think you should try to stick to the plan I described, and even double down on TSP and max out an IRA. At a minimum, max the IRA before you start funding a separate brokerage account.

But as for shopify, it looks like a decent buy as far as intrinsict value goes. Their last ER went pretty well. But remember if/when there's a downturn, retail/ecommerce is going to take a bigger hit than utilities and such. Might want to think about where were headed in the next 3-6 months before loading everything into $SHOP.

Maybe apple, Netflix, or Amazon? I would stay away from TSLA right now. How about target? What companies control consumer attention? Invest in those. And of course, you can't forget the white girl stocks LULU and ULTA. ",sturifidness,wallstreetbets,4.0

6,2018-12-12,"Gotcha, being liquid is great! It’s tough because everyone is saying a recession is coming, but we’ve heard that for 2 years now. 

I’m not as liquid but my strategy is to find a big safe company (Google, Apple, the ones above etc) and play the volatility. Google is great for this right now, steady swings of 5% up and down for the last couple months, buy the dips sell 75% at a peak (in case you sold early), repeat. It’s not like 5% is amazing but repeated 5% doesn’t suck. Or, buy and hold TSLA, this is my favorite stock by a mile but I won’t give you all the cool-aid arguments.

Just don’t sell if a recession hits or your buy continues to fall! That’s the key. It will be ok, Google etc aren’t going anywhere, if it gets crazy low increase your position.
