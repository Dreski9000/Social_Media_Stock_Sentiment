What about talking about the cumulative effect of all the tweets, amd how his continued role as POTUS directly contributes to market direction, and what his removal would do?

What about the effect his interactions with Congress and the press affects the confidence the retail investor has to put money in and what that may do.

All of these things require political discussion and disagreement. How about instead of banning them all together, we put our big boy pants on amd learn to except that there are people who disagree with us. Both rationally and irrationally.

Intel going 3D is also very good, but there are significant challenges with that approach that will not immediately result in huge gains. Rather the opposite. The market will I bet see 3D as a failure when intel fails to provide immediate competitive advantage over amd 7nm and 5nm and intel stock will likely suffer as a result. However, after years of staying the coarse intel will finally provide some major wins there and amd will not as easily be able to go 3D at lower nm — and thus the market will swing back.

Intel literally only has to poach 1-2 top engineers from AMD to fix their technical issues.

UVXY can move enough in one day to make this play max gain (~60%).  Of course UVXY could spike one day, sag the next, sideways the next, crater the next, then Friday fall back in your max loss zone.  Again degeneracy.

**Slightly less degenerate**

AMD bull call spread 19/25 15 Feb  
Each spread costs $163 per, max gain of $437

Slightly less

AMD bull call spread 19/20 15 Feb
Each cost $43, max gain of $57

*Problem with all the before is to get max gain, you need to be super in the money, or in the money and close to expiration.*

**More moderate**
  
Write AMD puts, 1 month out
1 Feb $18p  
You earn $145 for each contract, must leave $1800 for collateral.  8% returns isn’t sexy, but how many here wish they could earn that in a year?  Based on personal history selling puts, even on something as volatile as AMD, is a much safer bet than most plays.  Short of a recession, or AMD having a massive flaw, I think buying AMD (in case you get assigned) at just over $16.50 isn’t a bad play.",Gahvynn,wallstreetbets,82.0

Take AMD for example. Let’s say you own 100 shares with a cost basis of $17.42. You can write(sell to open) a call at a strike of $18 for next week. And you would receive $50 in income from the premium(bid price of the option). If the stock goes down you keep the $50, of the stock goes at or above $18 at expiration, you get a max profit of $50 plus $58 from the stock going up to the strike. Then it will sell the 100 shares for $18 at expiration.",TheRealNiBi,wallstreetbets,222.0

The 7nm should be unveiled and featured at CES next week by their CEO, Dr. Lisa Su, affectionately referred to at WSB as Su Bae. I read a few more articles online, somebody commented on AMD being the cheesy, smelly cock of the stock market, that you kind of want to touch and put in your mouth. I lol’d all over myself. 


I am a degenerate gambler, so one thing led to another and I bought ~$19,000 worth of AMD calls on Friday morning, even after it had gapped up. It soared and soared all day, and I sold for a ~$7000 profit at the end of the day. I’ll probably do this again next week with the 7k winnings, and maybe hold through CES this time.

You sell CSP, 20 AMD JAN19 $18 strike for $0.70 a piece.

You decide to sell calls to trim losses. your cost basis is $17.3 so you look at the $18 calls - no good, the ask on that is only $0.12. You decide to sell 20  $15.5 calls, you receive a premium of 0.55 each. cost basis now is $16.75/share

days later good news hits Reddit; TSMC pulled a rabbit out of the hat, doesn’t matter what. AMD rallies to $15.75, your 2000 shares get called away. you lose $1.25 per share. you’re out $2500

Additionally with the memory market as low at it is, HBM2 costs should be down as opposed to the first iteration of Vega. Vega couldn’t be produced in 4Q2017 and was sold out because HBM2 memory prices were outrageous. 

Also the fact that the die size is nearly half of the 2080 means that AMD has a greater yield per wafer. 

Pricing the Radeon VII any lower would also cannibalize the Vega 64-56 as well. 

By all means Nvidia does have better margins than AMD. But AMD has been guiding for margin expansion. And I do believe pricing it at $700 will positively impact their margin. This is the most expensive consumer GPU they’ve ever released (not counting Vega frontier, which was never advertised to gamers in the first place). 

I heard the rumors that they are taking a $50 loss on each card but I find it very hard to believe that, especially considering how competent Lisa Su is. 

Also the rest of the world (outside of America) is conscious to how much electricity they are using and how much they are spending. Not everybody has the money that Americans have.

10,2019-01-10,"\&gt;AMD margins will be much higher

1.If this is in anyway true, why didn't they just price the card lower? AMD aren't idiots, they know nobody will pick their card over an objectively better product if the price is higher. I think that the AMD margin is even less then NVIDIA and they've priced it as low as they could go.

2. The price of a gpu/cpu doesn't come from raw materials. smaller die size does not translate to cheaper chip. Lower power consumption is also not something the consumers they're targeting(""gamers"") care about too much, compared to performance.

the most interesting part was a heavily handicapped ryzen 3000 beating the top end INTC chip in a big way. finally AMD has beat INTC on single thread workloads. you also got confirmation that ryzen uses a chiplet design. a Feb 7 release of vega VII is also a great surprise.

i think AMD screwed up by reveling too much in the press release the week before CES keynote, and the CPU/GPU leaks that circulated in the follow up. had they kept the lid of the chromebook release, or the 7nm vega, it would have been a good surprise to SP. the presentation also focused a little too heavily on boring discussions with partners (xbox phil).

AMD is at 20.25 and you got $1000:

ATM 20 Calls exp 1/18 cost $.84, so you buy 11 ($924)

OTM 22 Calls exp 1/18 cost $.18, so you buy 55 ($990)

51,2019-02-07,"I keep seeing all these news articles and such talking about fortnite and how it'll impact other studios and their earnings and such and I don't understand it at all.

The gaming industry isn't like the computer hardware market where consumers are either going to spend their money on a CPU from AMD or Intel and then get their GPU from either AMD or NVIDIA etc so if one of them creates a better product the other misses out.

I literally just read an article about how Fortnite is one of the reasons EA had such a terrible earnings report due to Epic games bringing in so much money. The reason EA did so terribly is because they are completely out of touch with their customer base and they released a whole plethora of half finished garbage created around maximizing the amount of in-game microtransactions in an attempt to mimic the huge financial success of in-app microtransactions on phones and tablets.

These studios/companies aren't flopping because fortnite is stealing their business, they're flopping because fortnite caters to what their users are saying and they aren't.

Fallout 76 is a great example. Launch sales for fallout 76 were down 80% compared to fallout 4 because Bethesda continued to ignore their player base over and over through the betas.

Battlefront 2 and Battlefield V are two more great examples. At one point their community team literally told an entire community not to buy their game if they didn't like what they were doing with the game.

RuneScape is a good online example. Jagex rereleased the old version of their game as a standalone and it generally has 2-3x more active players than the main game they've been building for almost 20 years. The main game was massively monetized and filled with microtransactions, even after the community was super vocal about it, and pay to win and now their most popular game is a relaunch of the 2007 version of their game.

It's like you said, any studio that releases quality content is who's going to find success. Personally, I don't think the people who are trading these companies have any actual clue about how the game industry works especially if they think fortnite is the reason EA earnings is garbage. Fortnite could literally cease to exist tomorrow and it wouldn't really change any of EA's numbers because the literal garbage EA has been publishing for the past year is the cause, not fortnite.

I literally don't know how any of these people in charge don't understand fortnite's success. The base game is literally free. You don't have to spend a single penny on their game to play it. League of Legends is the exact same way. You could play LoL forever and never spend a penny yet these two games consistently bring in billions. It's not because the game has microtransactions. It's because they built an amazing game that people want to play so those same people purchase things for the game they love playing so much.",ShiftLeader,wallstreetbets,51.0

I was reading about options here and a user said something along the lines of ""Cut your losses at 30%"" which I figured would be a good practice to implement. 

I had 3 $8.5 2/8 SNAP calls and 1 $23 2/8 AMD call that I decided to unload literally moments before snap exploded to fucking $9 and AMD briefly hit $23 on Friday. I bought the calls to counter my SNAP and AMD puts which I didn't sell so I lost out on good gains AND have worthless puts.

17,2019-02-10,"Incorrect. Here's the example with random numbers. Lets say amd is 23 and he sells the 23.50 for .80. His dca is now 22.70. Lets say amd dips to 22.50 end of the week. He can sell next weeks 23 for another .80 to 1.00 bringing his dca down to 21.90. Pretend he gets called out that week on a pop on amd. He would have landed 16 to 20k in 2 weeks in premium. Every week he sells, his dca goes down a buck. I think amd's bottom in any worse case is 16-17. Hold the other 250K in case they dive. He doesnt have to keep selling the original shares if it drops, just wait it out for a little bit till it comes back up. If the premium isnt there, dont sell calls for a couple weeks.

NVDA has kept pace with the market rally too well for me to think this isn't going down.

I'm also bearish on the trade war, since I can't see Xi giving in. If Trump isn't meeting with him personally there's no chance. If we could stop the fake trade optimism pumps that would be great.

But honestly, the real reason I'm bagholding these puts is AMD. How the fuck can NVDA pump when they see AMD met earnings? Doesn't that just mean their competitor is taking market share? AMD mentioned no weakness in China. So isn't NVDA just spouting bullshit excuses for their poor GPU launch and mismanagement of the channel?

All my tendies vanished before my eyes( for months I was pissed at myself for losing all that money as I had been working 40hrs/wk for $11). \[BTW: this all took 2 wks to do so I guess I kinda lied. but a month before I had turned $76 to $1309\] 

Then I stopped trading for a while since I didn't have the funds to go on. then on Jan.19th RH lifted my Daytrader Status and I gave my two jobs( at this point I was working for 40hr-$11+monthly bonus/ 30hr-$10.5+biwkly bonus) my 2 wk notice and I started to trade full time. But, alas I did ONE stupid trade that wiped me out by wk2 of being unemployed. So I got my last check from work  1 and my tax return and put it into the stock market bringing me to today.

11,2019-03-02,"There was some weird bullshit graphic and I had to disable subreddit style to see the post. So I copy pasted the whole damn thing:

For serious though, the market can't beat me if I'm actively fighting it.

I'm curious, are you actually on the stock market, or are you afraid of it?

If you are already on the stock market, I just wasted a ton of time typing the following, but if you are afraid of it, you might want to listen.

When I first got onto the stock market I was dominating it consistently for at least a month before I stopped focusing on it so much (even started going days at a time without so much as glancing at it) because it was interfering with my job. People were getting their food deliveries late because I was distracted by all these pennies, and I don't believe in pretending to do a job that actually needs to be done so I decided to cut that shit out and shut down the constantly-having-anxiety-and-overanalyzing-everything-in-market-terms part of my brain so that I could actually go a shift without compulsively checking my phone or frantically trading.

Right now I need to focus on getting a newer car so that I can make more money, then I need to focus on getting from my motel room into an actual apartment so I can save more of the more money I'll be making, then it will be time to start dumping money into my trading account, probably cut down my delivery schedule, and get fully into my trading.

It then gets a lot easier because the bigger my portfolio gets, the more trading I'm free to do, which is an exponential difference in these early stages. For example, when I only owned 1 share of AMD, I couldn't freely sell AMD at whatever price point seemed high because that would cost my entire standing in the company and if it didn't bounce back into my price range I would just lose money. Once I owned 2-3 shares of AMD, that became something to play around with, because if I sold one too early I would still have the final one to hold or to sell at the best possible time.

So far I've mostly only been able to hold normal retail stocks like VWAGY, AMD, etc and trade ""penny stocks"" like OPTT or GERN. I don't know shit about OPTT or GERN except what I've learned as an investor. I know VWAGY and AMD intimately as major parts of the world I live in. The bigger companies that are more expensive to trade can also be much, much safer and more lucrative to trade for someone with my specific type of expertise. So when I go from having around $400 to having around $1200 in the market, that should way more than triple my ability to make gains even though it's only triple the amount.

And I was already constantly multiple times over the market before, so at that point it will really be easy as fuck to beat the market without any real chance of failure.

There's the kind of confidence where you know the chance of failure is small and there's not much you can do about it so it's best to just keep yourself focused on success instead of worrying about it, and then there's times where you actually just know for sure the chance of failure is pathetically tiny and there would be nothing to worry about even if you wanted to. The former is where I've been at most of the time so far, the latter is where I'll easily be once I get to where I can freely trade companies I actually know.

It's just too easy. You have to consider two things.

One, I'm one of the smartest, most well-informed civilians on the planet, a genius among geniuses, a king of smart people, so I can tend to outcompete in fair competitions with other smart people.

Two, and more importantly, the stock market does not primarily attract smart people. I don't know where the idea that Wall Street has smart people came from, but the reality is there are very few smart people in the finance sector and the few there are do very well for themselves.

You won't find smart people getting beaten by the market average. The market average is a very pathetic performance by a big collection of dumb people, it just isn't comparable to what you can do with a brain that actually works.

Just go look at an investment news site. Read some articles and try to discern good ones from bad ones. Consider that other people are also trying to discern the good ones from the bad ones, and betting millions and millions of dollars on their conclusions. Knowing people - in fact, being a denizen of /r/Drama, really intimately knowing how populations react to information they can read - do you really not see how incredibly easy of an opportunity that alone creates? Even if you're not very smart, you can probably find at least one article where you easily know the exact reality of the situation the article regards, and you also easily know exactly how everyone else is going to react to the article and what kind of delusions they'll have about the reality. I'm sure you can find at least one that you just ""get"" because you have some info most people don't - everyone has some area of expertise. And if you can do that, you can see how the type of people who read all the time and try to be experts on a lot of different shit would be able to keep finding articles like that, and from that, you can understand how the competition of the entire modern world really works.

Every single person with any intelligence in the stock market absolutely decimates the everloving shit out of the market average by actually getting rich, which is what I'm going to do. The market sits around pretending to enjoy single-digit-percentage gains while above-average people - I'd say probably anyone around the 98th or 99th percentile - keep doubling or tripling or quadrupling their money until the exponential impact of increased wealth starts to work in reverse and it starts getting harder to trade your positions because they're so big, instead of dangerous because they're so small like in the beginning. After that, it gets impossible to keep doubling or tripling shit without being a mega-super-ultra-genius like me, but beating the market remains easy as fuck for anyone who tries with that kind of money.

If you're not smart enough to get rich, you should still be able to beat the market. If you're one of those people whose brains just don't work right for this shit and you can't beat the market, then don't trade actively, just buy and hold companies you like (maybe with one of the free brokers who discourage active investing like M1 Finance instead of Robinhood) and you'll still at least beat inflation or the interest bank accounts offer.

Seriously, if you have $50 to hold onto, get on the market. You have nothing to fear if you're not retarded.",an_exciting_couch,wallstreetbets,11.0

As far as the futures, with your kind of  money, you need to be day trading shares and futures only. Forget options unless you are selling covered calls.

I'll give you a hint, Imagine if you put $30,000 of shares into AMD pre-market today and it's up 90 cents right now.  You would have that profit and taken it today. You also can sell calls while holding the shares and etc..

As for the futures, they are just like shares except make you a lot more and move quickly and every day including sunday and you can trade them at 3am if you want and get in before things..

You need to learn about them some first.. just watch some youtube videos of some guys trading them a few times.. and you'll see it, there is nothing to it but just timing on when to buy and hold. You can trade in and out in minutes to hours.. it's not a holding thing unless you really want to but you only hold if you got them in December or after a big big big drop like Dow down 800-1000 points, that's when you buy and hold futures for months.. otherwise you just trade them in minutes or just 1 day etc..

18,2019-03-12,"Daily I try to tell everyone here to day trade options. Options are gay and good for nothing but quick crazy days like Boeing just had.

  


Tesla also recently with its gay news of the cheaper model.

  


The market screws options over with implied volatility and theta decay..

  


This is a classic example.

  


If you sell put spreads you can be ok, as you only have to have the stock price stay above the strike price.

  


Buying calls and holding them longer than 1 day just is asking the market makers and hedge funds and algos to do everything they can to take that money.

  


It's the reason why buying shares or selling puts is the answer if you hold longer.

  


Options trading in WSB form should be strangles, straddles and just day trading calls or puts depending on the news.

  


Think about the days Nvidia dropped from 170, AMD soared to 35! APPLE flew down from 230, tilray roared up to ?, now Boeing down to 380 and back up to 400 etc..

  


Play options on those and/or buy otm cheap calls right during a big red dip day.

  


Notice the market seems to rush up after 4pm ehen you can't buy options.. I have seen the market rush up to the exact penny over the strike when selling calls after market hours. It's no coincodence.

  


Anyway I'm just going to say, get into the future. (You'll see soon)

  


The futures awaits, and take profit when you have those big jumps like you just had, because marketmakers, algos, etc will quickly in the blink of an eye proceeding that right back in.

  


Just take your profit and move on.

There is still plenty of money to be made, just wait for after this China news crap deal happens or more likely doesnt happen!

38,2019-04-01,"I am just dumbfounded.. You have $10,000 that could have bought $20,000 worth of shares on 2x margin of Tesla shares at $269 anytime it was around there for awhile. Those shares don't decay, and you would have sold and been done with it, now you are with options decaying and at a stupid strike to be honest.

Having said that, I hope it does work, I mean I want people to make money, but I just see people put bets like $10,000 on Tesla 300 calls~?!  


How about start buying shares of SOXS for $6/share! or TVIX for $25.50/share and how about AMD for $26.30/share.  All of these are going to go up and  you won't have to worry about your expiration with shares.


In particular AMD will try to hit $27 very soon, So think about shares and sell calls $27 or just hold the shares and close at $27/28 for some quick trades as earnings run-up is coming up.

AMD is going to have good earnings, they have new products and companies are starting to use their CPU and GPU much more now. They are the cheap quick way to get in on the tech push into Intel's market share.

Remember, AMD was $2/share in 2015, it's only been 3 years and look where they are. Just giving you a heads up.. lets see what you do.

In this case: I know one of the criteria is that 2018's EPS decreased from 17 after three years of improvement. Return on equity was still positive but cut in half, and as an active businessperson in the sector, GoDaddy's losing market share to other smaller cloud based services as the industry in general consolidates.

They also spend less on TV commercials, which is a good signal that it wasn't effective enough for them to continue. Revenue is stagnating and the OTM option volatility skews on my script obviously didn't like what's going on here.

Could be right, could be wrong, but without following it closely for a few weeks before picking to trade it, I can't say much.

Their guidance would probably offer you more valuable color on the reasons why the numbers say what they do, though. I'm purely programmatic, minus NVDA and AMD trades, because LULz

AMD in Mac Pros - Wrong, no thunderbolt 3 support. But you didn't know that because you don't know what you're talking about.

AMD went up because people hated Intel's unveil. Wrong it was due to an analyst report and $33 price target. INTC went up as well today.

AMD will have a 18 month lead on Intel chips - Wrong, Zen 2 still won't match the IPC of current Intel chips, merely get close. More cores doesn't automatically mean faster performance either. You have zero clue how any of this stuff works, so stop strutting around like you do with you $10,000 account or whatever the fuck you have in Robinhood.

Most of their customers in the past buy the lower cost CPUs so they generate slim profit per customer. A 5Ghz 16 core mainstream CPU will be such a leap in power that this will be one of those sweet spots in history. More people than usual will feel compelled to finally upgrade and each will dig deeper for a higher end purchase that they feel will last.

They'll have dramatically increased market share and average selling price during a boom cycle.

I think the stock is actually worth $30 right now but it will likely boom up to $60+ this year and then bust back down to $30-40 late 2020. They'll have gained market share and margin but lose most of the P/E premium they enjoy (AMD PE = 88, Intel PE = 12).",sasksean,wallstreetbets,25.0

Sorry for not doing this yesterday, but I think this help clarifies the situation a bit (while still leaving some ambiguity). I think to a certain degree everyone had the right idea, but how Tesla's cars came together is/was a bit of a mystery.

The heart of Tesla's new ASAD system is their custom work(an ASIC chip) that is plugged into a older Samsung Exynos (modified off the shelf asfaik) to handle some traditional I/O and compute tasks. This samsung chip uses ARM cores.

[https://electrek.co/2019/01/04/tesla-leaks-hardware-3-self-driving-computer/](https://electrek.co/2019/01/04/tesla-leaks-hardware-3-self-driving-computer/)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/acjdrt/tesla\_autopilot\_hw3\_details/](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/acjdrt/tesla_autopilot_hw3_details/)

Plugged into the SoC a PCI-E slot is Tesla's custom chip called TRIP.

  
Tesla also added Intel Atom (low powered) chips to handle infotainment systems. I suspect there was a good chance they had talks with AMD about this too, but AMDs Atom competitor isn't quite ready for the limelight yet. That said I'd imagine Tesla has an incredible amount of flexibility here and could easily switch to a different chip manufacturer if they desired. On that point, I believe they could switch from the Samsung chip too if they found a new ARM based SoC they wanted to use.  


This all seemed to stem in part of a big misconception that GPUs were an essential component of self driving systems. Here is Elon's relevant quote:

*""But using a GPU, fundamentally it's an emulation mode, and then you  also get choked on the bus. So, the transfer between the GPU and the CPU  ends up being one of the constraints of the system.""*

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Tesla has a custom chip but is using ARM and x86 chips in their cars, and I wouldn't rule out AMD partnering with them in the future as a supplier when they introduce their low powered x86 competitor.",Flyers179,wallstreetbets,10.0

I see the market pricing in things but ofcourse I cant predict it but you can see when it's doing it..

  


I'll write up a post on it.

  


So I must have seen low IV or a moment when may 17th calls went sky high in IV and then dropped big on price which is when you buy calls as then as earnings on the 24th gets closer, those prices go back up sky high because of IV.. etc.. it gets deeper but that was the idea

I'll give you a start and will be happy to answer any questions as they come about. My first advice is google and read up on ""Chiplet Architecture"". Unless some other advancement comes out of nowhere, it looks like the most likely path CPU design will be taking. Today's monolithic dies haven't met Moore's Law for a while.

AMD has a very solid head start in this area of innovation and I think it's often overlooked. Don't forget just how innovative they were back in the early 2000's. That potential is still there. As a company they're engineering driven, which is something Intel lost long ago. There's a reason INTC has been leaching AMD talent the last 2-3 years.",DeginGambler,wallstreetbets,0.0

When they take the IV out, you’re back to where you’re supposed to be. But that ride up, to get you to where you’re supposed to be, it doesn’t really exist. It raises your chances of curing, but when they take it out, you’re back to where you started.

Alive. 

IV is speed. Use it like that. Every ticker has a different IV. If the IV for AMD averages 48% and you see it at 65% and buy options, you’re toast. 

To use IV at an advantage, sell within the first hour of trading. If you’re long options, don’t buy until the IV of your ticker is near average.

This is why IV goes up closer to earnings. The stock market ain’t stupid. Good luck.",doctor-key,wallstreetbets,2.0

4,2019-04-11,"Won't argue with the lobbying part at all, Intel has the coffers and connections to make that happen. If I'm being cynically realistic, it's probably the most likely outcome.

However, I have to ask, are you in the tech industry or follow it outside of the market? I'm not sure most people realize the implications of some of these security issues that Intel has been subject to these past few years. HT was basically a shortcut sacrificing security for speed. There's hundreds of pages of information summarized in that last sentence but it's my best way to explain how I see it.

You mention them developing their on specialized chips, which is in my eyes yet another bullish argument when you study what AMD's lead in chiplet architecture potentially delivers. Intel will likely follow-up soon with their own chiplet design and with their financial prowess they obviously have the power to once again leap past AMD but it's anything but a sure thing. For at least the next two years AMD should gain a significant portion of marketshare in the datacenter. 

I'm having to stop myself from dumping a wall of text because I literally get excited reading and studying this shit. It's why I entered AMD in 03/2016 and haven't sold any shares, just accumulate and swing options.

Bet your ass some parties would go to the trouble to take advantage of those exploits in that scenario.

Only way I see Intel getting the contract is if they've greased the right palms. Given our government officials records and Intel's history of playing dirty, I wouldn't be terribly surprised.

4,2019-04-11,"Sure thing!

My main earnings strategy is to sell far out of the money puts the day before the earnings release. The expiry I pick is the closest one to the day after earnings which will have the highest implied volatility. Implied volatility (IV) is very high right before an earnings release because the non-inside traders don't know if the stock will go up or down. It's a gamble. Some stocks are more volatile than others. Companies like $AMD or $TSLA are going to move huge while other companies like $JPM (tomorrow morning) may not move so much. The higher the IV the more money there is to be made. 

&amp;#x200B;

After the earnings release the IV drops an outstanding amount because everyone knows what has happened. This is what is referred to as ""IV crush"". For example, $BBBY had an IV of 129% before close 4/10/19 and dropped to \~50-70% on open today. You will recall from your Black-Scholes options mathematics that Vega is the relation of an options contract price to IV. Price goes up, IV goes up, price goes down, IV goes down. Basically, you can guarantee that every earnings release on every company will experience enormous IV crush. If you buy the calls or puts you're screwed by this no matter what direction you pick. If you sell a call or put you can capitalize on this IV crush by selling the contact when the premium is grossly inflated and buying it back cheap after the crush.

&amp;#x200B;

So why ""far OTM strikes""? This strategy is not foolproof. If you sell an ATM put and the stock shits (like $BBBY did today) the change in Delta (the relation of the underlying to the options contract price \[e.g. stock goes down, call price goes down, put price goes up; stock goes up, call price goes up, put price goes down\]) may cause you to lose money if the change in Delta is larger than the decrease in Vega. Remember that when you sell a put the worst case scenario is that your contact expires in the money and you are assigned and will own 100 shares per option contact on whatever stock you picked at the strike price you picked (although the stock price may drop much lower than whatever strike price you picked so you will own shares that are worth much less). If your contact expires out of the money you get to keep the premium you collected in full. The name of the game is to pick a strike that will not expire in the money. So look at how the stock moves during past earnings. $BBBY moves like 15-20%, so you need to pick a strike that can tolerate that movement and not be in the money. $LULU moves like 20% on earnings. If your strike is low enough you don't need to be too worried if the stock shits the bed 20%. 

&amp;#x200B;

When you sell puts the profit is capped so this is not yacht-making money. The return for the lower profits though is a higher probability of success which if you execute this strategy over and over again you will start to accumulate some nice wins and you can start to laugh at the people who buy calls and puts the day before earnings and lose their ass on the I V  C R U S H and that they picked the wrong direction. 

&amp;#x200B;

Below are some real trades I have made illustrating what I have described:

&amp;#x200B;

3/20/19: $MU sold to open 22 MAR 40p at 1.35 at 109% IV.

3/21/19: $MU bought to close 22 MAR 40p at 0.29 at 60% IV (1.06 profit). 

3/27/19: $LULU sold to open 29 MAR 130p at 1.62 at 135 IV.

3/28/19: $LULU bought to close 29 MAR 130p at 0.02 at 80% IV (1.60 profit).

4/2/19: $GME sold to open 12 APR 8.5p at 0.16 at 113% IV.

4/3/19: $GME bought to close 12 APR 8.5p at 0.13 at 65% IV. ($GME shit the bed. This one came close to not being profitable but it worked out for a tiny 0.03 profit).

4/10/19: $BBBY sold to open 18 APR 15p at 0.14 at 129% IV.

4/11/19: $BBBY bought to close 18 APR 15p at 0.04 at 70% IV. ($BBBY shit the bed too but the IV crush was massive too. Doesn't matter, 0.10 profit).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm all cash at the moment (aside from a small position in $REML) in preparation for $NFLX earnings on Tuesday. The 18 APR contacts are already around 69% IV and they usually trade around 35% (forecasting a 34% I V  C R U S H already!). You could sell the 18 APR 312.5p at 1.00 and tolerate a 15% drop in the stock after earnings. Not a bad buffer. After that we have $TWTR, $FB, $TSLA, $AMD, and $AAPL.

9,2019-05-03,"basically, an option is a contract that gives you the \*option\* to buy (calls) or sell (puts) 100 shares of stock at a given \*strike price\* . The option contract has an expiration date, at which point the option will expire worthless if it is not exercised. 

So, when reading a quote like AMD 5/03 35c, that would be the option to buy 100 shares of AMD stock at a strike price of 35 dollars by May 3rd. 

That contract costs 1 dollar. It will almost certainly expire worthless, because AMD will almost certainly not finish at or above 35 by tomorrow. 

Most important thing to know about options is that time is valuable. A short-dated (1 week-2 months) contract will lose value over time unless the stock moves in your direction pretty consistently.

24,2019-05-02,"Look dude, the cash flow your 100k can produce is probably worth more than risking it all to buy a condo outright.

Take tbills, interest amounts to ~2k a yr. not a lot, but if you’re paying 1k/mo, 12k/yr in rent. This is a decent amount to subsidize your housing.

Step up the risk a little? 
O/F/T/GE/etc all pay dividends that I think exceed tbills. 
I own some O, so using the 3.87% on ETrade, you’d get ~3870/yr. 

You probably get my point with dividends and interest. 

The next layer I’d think to explore would be using derivatives to collateralize your assets by writing options/derivatives. 
This is a far more complex, and in most cases, far more risk-prone approach. But you can get decent reward for relatively isolated risk.

Take this recent amd earnings call. I approached it from the perspective of “I’d like more shares, and I think things are fairly volatile at the moment” so instead of buying 100 shares outright for 27.50 the week before earnings, I wrote a 28.50P for 5/17 and collected about $240. Which means on assignment I’d have an actual per share price of ~26.60.

Looking at that example, and focusing on two outcomes from holding the contract: either it expires worthless or I am assigned, the next decision is easy for me; I just take the result, cash or equity, and write another contract against it.


Lot so of chat about a very narrow view of options here, but there’s other venues than longing options into oblivion. Esp if you’re trying to ultimately subsize cost of living.

That's a pretty reasonable outlook for AMD, and holding the stock for a year or two should allow you to capture that growth. 

The 5/3 35 call will be 100% worthless unless AMD hits 35 by TOMORROW. Its retarded. 

So to say that pick is not a wild card because AMD is a good stock is missing the point. It's a wild card because it's a bet on direction and time, and it's a bet that the stock will move 7 points in 24 hours.

64,2019-05-02,"\&gt; I am a bit confused when buying stocks. What should I watch before buying a stock? 

Technicals? Fundamentals? Whatever you find useful to gauge the future value of a stock.

&amp;#x200B;

Dividend yield is fine but you need to pay attention to the dividend payout ratio. A high dividend payout ratio tends to be near a top of dividend yield. A company can't pay out a ton of net income forever. If you're looking at income stocks dividend payout ratio will be an important fundamental.

&amp;#x200B;

Stock price in isolation is meaningless. $1000 might be cheap for Google, but very expensive for AMD. Again you need a method of evaluating stocks.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;  Lastly please let me know if I should buy individual stocks for  dividends or should I buy etf and index stocks for dividends instead. 

If you don't have much money available a portfolio of stocks will likely underperform a similar portfolio of ETFs. The reason being is it's tough to diversify stocks properly under that amount. There are plenty of good portfolio strategies you can use on the internet for ETFs in a buy and hold scenario. Adjust them to your risk preferences and of course do your research on each ETF before purchasing.",AfterArtichoke6,wallstreetbets,64.0

If the positions are closed out, what was your P/L on each one?  If your positions are still open how do you expect to capitalize on OTM calls at this point?

Consider the current prices at this moment (5/2 10:40 am Eastern Time):

* AMC - $14.70 vs 16.5 5/3 calls
* MRK - $79.79 vs 79 5/10 calls

I'm super new to everything, but I'm also a semi-professional poker player (mostly NL Texas Hold'em) so I'm always aware of high-risk, high-reward situations. 

(I apologize in advance If I ask any questions that you do not wish to answer/If it makes you think I did not read the post.) 

**(Note: I take all risk(s) in my attempts in trading and I do not blame you (OP) for anything they share. I do not consider this advice but just answering with his opinion with any or all questions I ask.)

***(I plan on doing way more studies of my own before I even attempt to do anything. I have never traded nor attempted to trade to this date.)

0) Is there any Do's and Don't advice for a newbie? Like is there any common mistakes I could know about? Is there any website(s) that give solid information about the activities of everything in general that happens during the trade week? Also, is there a preferable trading outlet I should consider trying? I want to do my 'due diligence' but afraid of reading ill-informed information which would then skew my point of view accordingly, which could have been avoided by reading quality material.

1) I don't mind losing all of my invested cash, but what would be a good 'starting size' bank roll to develope a sizable portfolio? (In example, is a ""$500"" bank roll invested in small scale items similar to a ""$20,000"" bank roll invested in bigger scale items?)

2) As a potential ""Investor"", I feel more tempted to 'ride the waves' for a more ""long term investment"" than most. I understand the market is very unforgiving with swings in either direction. Is this a general ""bad play"" for traders? More for your opinion on this one: In general, do you feel that we are supposed to ride the waves day by day, or is it possible to ride for longer terms? I assume there's a bigger risk by not playing it ""minute by minute"", but I'm tended to believe that just because something closes low, doesn't mean like it's ""doomed to be low"" forever?

3) Im more interested in stuff like technologies, so would it be a wiser decision to 'invest' and 'trade' for stuff in a similar category? Like since i'm really into building computers and such, would it be easier for me to read into trends of Apple, Microsoft, AMD, Intel, Nvidia... etc if I keep up with how everybody is doing? I'm open to ""open my horizons"" and delve into other stuff, but I feel that I should build up confidence in myself and 'stay in my little realm' for now. To me, this seems to be like a huge, vast plane and it would be literal suicide to dive into stuff I know nothing about, besides looking at a few graphs that depict ""trends"", and bet on them. 

4) Most importantly, to me, what skills can you learn while doing this? I'm more so interested in learning analytical skills and comprehensive assessments *while* trying to make cash. Kinda like ""earn while you learn"" type stuff. I know I probably won't be the next big guy, but I feel as long as I have a ""chip and a chair"", I can still be in the game. I understand I can fall flat on my ass, but that's 'a OK' to me. As long as I learn something productive while doing this, I feel it'll be a great experience for me.

&gt; any tariffs levied on semiconductor products imported into China could still hit AMD and Intel CPUs sold into the mainstream server market.

I think you're the person to ask -- do you know how much revenue AMD makes from direct customer sales as opposed to B2B? I think their processors are the go-to contender for the budget conscious but I still think Intel tops PC builders. I'm not sure if that number is different with their B2B sales and I don't know how to find this information.

I was looking at Western Digital, another company that imports from Thailand. I think they started to doing that with their HDDs almost a decade ago. What's your thoughts on them? I saw Michael Burry add it to his Scion's portfolio and he's good at picking up underpriced stocks.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) was the best performing stock in the S&amp;P 500 for 2018 with an almost 69% gain. Tony Mitchell first bought AMD in October 2014 at $3.45. Today it trades at $26.

While you don’t often see a great performance like AMD had in 2018 followed by another great performance in the following year, there is a good reason to believe history can repeat itself with AMD.

Intel announced in January 2018 that its processors were vulnerable to attacks called Spectre and Meltdown. Intel initially said Spectre and Meltdown were industry-wide problems implying that AMD had no advantage. That is why it took a while before investors saw through Intel's spin and drive up AMD's price.

Believe it or not, it's happening again. In March, Intel revealed its CPUs were vulnerable to another attack called [Spoiler](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenkam/2019/03/05/new-intel-cpu-vulnerability-bodes-well-for-amd/#104b17e47961).

This time around the researchers who discovered Spoiler tested AMD processors and found them to be immune. Consequently, Spoiler will give AMD an advantage over Intel. The question now is how big is AMD's advantage and will it last long enough for them to gain significant market share.

Notice,

Lets see, not going to buy calls until thursday around 3pm and only anything that costs less than $0.10 calls expiring on Friday.. There is a good chance it will flop down lower or even do the ol' down 200 points and then swing right back up 200 points in same day to cancel out. So there is a chance we trade flat as well.. Just don't trade anything because I think they will price in things thursday overnight.. (as in the futures will all the sudden rip up or down at 12 midnight or 3am , 6am etc..)

I guess Volatility went up...Geeeeee, who would have thought after Vix hit back down to $11 that it could ever get back up to $20?!

I mean nobody could ever guess that Vix would somehow at somepoint go back up right!?

I mean we had ""slow growth"" and ""end of bull run"" pushed on us sooo much earlier in the year and it was just a matter of time WITHIN the year that we would not be able to continue straight up.

2019 went up almost what? 14-20% on the Indices in 4 months?? That's more than any year of holding for the Entire year in General..

I mean who could of guessed the market wouldn't hold..

Don't buy options until tomorrow to yolo on the trade crap..

I will probably sell strike $23 puts on AMD if it lowers to $25.50.

I can't wait to see what the puts make that I sold on UVXY today.

I will wait to see what shares holding in TVIX from $19 will make as well.

I Love WSB and so far I don't think the new E-Micro futures are good.

It's better to trade the real future.

I mean who wants a micro future? You want the full future ahead of you.

Get to the future WSB.

(and where is the guy who bought Spy $300 calls? You see now why I told you it was pointless and not to yolo until after China news and also to not yolo anything unless it's under $0.10 calls which I think you actually may have bought them for under .10! I forget)",legiondoom,wallstreetbets,52.0

Both could be reduced to rubble tomorrow but that's also why I bought the 5/17 calls and not 5/10 FDs. I have another week for Xi to suck Trump's economic dick and for them to rise again but in AMD's case, it's 1.34 a share and M$ is 1.04. They'd have to go down quite a bit for me to lose everything.

Don't be afraid to buy the dip, gaiz. For instance, I'm glad I sold my SPY puts in the morning because now it's up to 286 last I checked. If Trump decided to fuck the market over, it'll likely revert to yesterday's levels before free-falling EOD Friday.",Jubelowski,wallstreetbets,13.0

&amp;nbsp;

I got a wash sale disallowed of $12.63 on my second trade of AMD because I rebought the stock on 9/10. Based on my 1099-B it looks like my total gain for that year thanks to AMD was:

$2601.83-$2560.26 = $41.57.

 **BUT WHAT GIVES, MY WASH SALE DISALLOWED IS MAKING MY TOTAL GAIN $54.20 BECAUSE IT'S NOT COUNTING THAT $12.63 LOSS, I'M PAYING MORE IN TAXES!**  

Actually, when we look a little bit closer, they're doing the cost basis adjustment automatically!

Look at my Robinhood history: https://i.imgur.com/jQuXGIT.png

45 Shares for $1270.80. Now if we look back at the last 2 transactions on my 1099-B and add together the cost basis for the two we get:

$1001.03 + $282.40 = 1283.42.

They're automatically doing the ""Cost Basis Adjustment"" I discussed in my post, and raising my total cost by $1283.42-$1270.80 = **$12.63!** (My wash sale disallowed)

I’ll say this though, since Intel has opened up the Thunderbolt specification to be included in USB 4 and works closely with Apple, there is an outside chance that they could adopt AMD CPUs for the Mac Pro and still work with Intel to license the tech to include it with the Mac Pro.

8,2019-06-01,"CCs are considered the most safe options strategy.  

Biggest pitfall to avoid is choosing the wrong stock, setting up the play without knowing each outcome, and choose a strike that you did not actually want to sell at simply because of the nice premium.  Pitfalls you cannot avoid is a large drop in the underlying stock.  However, if a stock drops hard, you still beat everyone that ONLY held the stock.  

Using the example above, because the 2% is the amount of premium paid to OP, then the play naturally has 2% of downside protection.  

Because he is selling an ATM call, the play will max out at 2%.  At expiration, anything above the strike will sell the shares and OP keeps the 2%.  Anything below, OP will keep the shares and keep the premium.  Both can be advantageous.  But, if it is under, technically you have to count that too.  So if SPY loses 1%, then OP's play will be net +1%.  

For an OTM option, your profit can be higher.  Say I buy 100 shares of AMD at $25.  I sell an AMD $30 Call 45 days out for $115.  If it hits, I profit rise AND premium.  $500+$115=$615

You do not want to sell CC on stocks you are VERY bullish on, only slightly bullish.  If AMD drops 5%, you don't want to sell a 3% OTM CC because if it recovers, you capped your profit at 3%.",Azntigerlion,wallstreetbets,8.0

So for sports events you could be given an option to play say the previous match in a game in anticipation for something like the ""final four"" of march madness.  The games could updated with real world advertisement in game instead of annoying commercials.

The whole point of streaming games to generate revenue off streaming, not selling consoles. Heck Sony didn't make money off consoles, they made it off licensing and sales.

25,2019-06-05,"x86 is less and less meaningful outside of very specific circumstamces.  Are you worried that an incompatible ISA will keep you from running Windows 10 and the Witcher 3 on your K6 machine?  Do you have an app that really needs SSE4 for the sweet CPU graphics?   Do you need a 32 bit OS to run on a pre x86_64 CPU (if so, NeckbeardOS has you covered... don't let those haters get you down)?

In practical terms, x86 refers to an ISA defined family of chips protected by a copyrights and patents that only AMD IBM and Intel can legally produce.  Software has evolved along with it, but the nuts and bolts of the chip beyond the decoders have been RISC-like for some time.

X86 is more of an ongoing standard based upon mutual collaboration (formerly called the ""Wintel"" monopoly) than a single standard or a defining feature of high tech CPUs.  Lots of stuff could be removed and sometimes is (fare thee well, MMX), but everyone keeps compiling to the current standard.

If anything, China would prefer to drop x86 because 1) it would make their hardware incompatible with Western Devil hardware, 2) they could pare down the useless garbage kept for compatibility and 3) they can decree OS level compatibility by forcing their Big Brother linux distro.",amschind,wallstreetbets,25.0

A ton of business were beaten to the punch by Netflix's streaming business, everyone is getting on the bandwagon because they don't want to be where Netflix's competitors were for years regarding content streaming.

Samsung really needs to work with all of the Streaming competitors so that they can bundle their services into every Samsung smart TV, it doesn't have to be the top of the line experience but they could join the equivlant of Sega Channel.  

For instance you could have ESPN stream free basketball videos games a few hours before one of those final march madness basket ball games.

You don't know if it will break up or down, but we assume at this point MCD will move up.

Seen a lot of good news on AMD recently:
7nm card popping at E3, or at least the official announcement
Partnering with Sony AND Microsoft for their next gen consoles. I know the Sony one is for GPU and CPU, not clear what the xbox will use.
This could be the catalyst that pushes it past 40 over the next 8 months or so, akin to NVIDIA jumping a few years back to hover where it's at these days.

""The fact we are ahead of them on an architectural node for the first time in our 50 year history is causing customers to pause and consider risk mitigation when considering our competitor""

""We've been hiring a lot of software engineers to improve the ecosystem""

""Four years ago it was challenging to attract talent to the company because the roadmap was not obvious, now we are attracting a lot of talent... attrition is low.""

""The interest in Rome is very strong and we are very pleased, we see a solid path towards double digit market share but we are under no illusions. Our competitor is behind by a node but will come back but we are up for it""

""2021 is a good time frame for really seeing momentum on that product (Epyc?)""

""By 2020 we would be looking for a better balance between our cloud and enterprise customers which you would want because cloud is lumpy""

""What we showed at computex last week was very much incremental improvements over the last generation... we want to differentiate by price at different price points including 50% cheaper at the high end""

Re shortages: ""We're being very careful into how we manage our brand, we are protecting our brand... we want to ensure the supply chain is not upset in anyway, generally it seems fine... AMD is showing leadership in a place it never showed leadership before in terms of a node... the calls we are making 3 generations ahead are very attractive to customers""

""We've been building out our presence across OEMS, Lenovo is a great example, HP as well, we hope to get Dell and others on board as things move forward""

""Its important for us as we grow our marketshare throughout GPU markets that people are familiar with Radeon""

""We believe we have very unique IP, we are happy to enable others with that IP as long as we don't end up competing with ourselves... we are a product company, a high performance computing company... so while IP licensing is something we pursue it is not something we are distracted by""

""Our long term model is a target of 42-44% gross margin, we've guided to 41% this year... we do have some work to do on our discrete graphics gross margin... can gross margin go higher than 44%? Let us get there and then we can share a plan.""

""We will share more about navi as part of the livecast at E3, we will also give more information about our new RDNA architecture""

3800x: A good deal tbh... not much else to say, but spend a little more and get a 9700k and lose some cores? seems like a shitty argument imo. 

3700x: isn't much better than last gen amd for more money..

3600x &amp; 3600: I imagine these will be huge just because of the great value.


As for GPU's I imagine nvidia will announce new stuff over the weekend, amd stuff just isn't that competitive but the real value for amd stock is is the cpu's anyways. 

Overall I'm torn. I think AMD has potential to be big in the long run, kinda like BYND, and if that's anything to go by, all in calls. 

However with all this said, intel spends more money on R&amp;D than the next 4 companies in the WORLD combined. All it takes is one announcement from intel for amd to crash back to where it was, and guess what's coming up? intel announcement, a year from their last CPU release.

&gt;Borderlands 3 Was Literally Made for AMD Hardware

&gt;here's nothing quite like Borderlands. Other games offer some of the same characteristics, from the art style and crass humor to the progression-based systems built on top of a first-person shooter, but none bring them all together in quite the same way. There's some good news for fans of the series, especially if they use AMD products, because Gearbox Software and 2K announced today that Borderlands 3 debuts on September 13 and will be very AMD-friendly.

This is bullshit, there are plenty of architectures that have a shit load of mobo designs that failed pretty hard. The reason why there are so many is because AMD promised that the chipset wouldn't change, so you could keep your mobo from last gen, but these new chips use a lot more power. Because of that, the old ones aren't gonna cut it... A lot of these ""new"" mobo's are just the old ones with better cooling and whatnot.

The top end has always been Intel (for the last 10 years) and id bet it will stay that way for single core performance. Not enough programs average people use can take advantage of the extra cores yet. With that said amd does have some crazy value chips with the 3600, but I think this is a buy on the hope they will grow bigger, there is still a chance what happened last year will happen again.

You think zombieload is going to be the last vulnerability you'll have to patch for with Intel? No. The architecture cuts corners on security checks. Oh but let's just wait for the hardware mitigations! [Those suck too.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/bxf8ld/intels_hardware_mitigation_suffers_the_same)

Spending more on R&amp;D doesn't mean good results. Can I remind you that Intel sucked so bad at 5g that they withdrew and the stock price went up? All their R&amp;D money isn't going to let them catch up with AMD and NVIDIA on the GPU side either. 

Also it isn't an AMD vs Intel R&amp;D show anymore. Half of the battle is fabrication technology. AMD is uses TSMC along with other big players like Apple and NVIDIA. AMD can switch to Samsung if they needed. So on that front it's Intel vs the rest of the world. There's a reason Intel hasn't released 10nm in volume. There's a reason their leaked roadmap shows 14nm for another couple of years. It just isn't going to magically fix itself.

Do you know what Intel did to AMD for a long time? AMD would come out with a better architecture but Intel would be able to node shrink and re-gain the advantage.

When you're investing in AMD the question is: AMD has better CPUs for the next couple of years across desktop, mobile, and server, can they take away market share with better products? This hasn't always been the case since they've had better GPUs than NVIDIA but did not take more market share.

On the GPU side, can AMD take away market share from NVIDIA? Google Stadia and Samsung have told me yes, for whatever reason companies are working with AMD vs NVIDIA. I expect Microsoft to announce their cloud gaming partnership with AMD soon.",anhties,wallstreetbets,90.0

There might be a short term bump with the hype, but ultimately I don't think global telecommunications infrastructure is in a place to make these streaming services anything more than glorified game demo platforms.

For cpu it won't be intel as last gen was AMD for both sony/msoft and Lisa Su already said they are working on both next gen consoles. 

Only issue for Microsoft is if they have to bump the price due to tarrif bs cause lots of the components are made in China. I think they won't announce price this year though.

Since I have taken out my position from earlier today the Implied vol went up, and the price jumped closer to the strike of $7 (currently sitting at 6.80). As a I can sell now and cover my premium (paid .15, its now at .35). 

As for $AMD I am long on it, took a call out for $42 strike price with the contract expiring in January of 2021. The reasoning behind this is that the new processor is in the new XBOX that is being shipped with the new Halo game. Further, im betting that Bethesda will unveil their next big game, Starfield, as a console launch title with the XBOX (Bethesda and Xbox have become close over the past 5 years). On top of all of this the new China threat is against Intel, Microsoft, and Dell (among others). 

All of these points to a good 2020 year for AMD, and im pretty optimistic that by q1 of 2021 AMD's price will be around $60 with it going down to $50 or $45 by fall 2021.

If have options Pls pls pls listen to me once you have your gains cash out don’t bother holding if your expiration dates are far out. If your expiration dates are short I’m pretty sure your planning on getting your gains and cashing out right away.

If you flat out buying stock wait for the price to drop below $30 it will and a lot sooner than you think.


Navi 5700 = Vega 56 which now goes for $250. There is no reason for people to upgrade

Navi 5700 xt = Vega 64 which goes for $300 now or you can buy a 56 mod the bios and it’s the same. Again no reason to upgrade

Navi 5700 xt 50th anniversary is just an OC 5700 xt. Only reason to buy is if you like exclusive products.

They seem to be a big player influencing the market as usual. They raised their rating on Tesla earlier last week and bam. Rise. AMD is a solid company but I don't know how high they will go. 

Tbh, I think this is all just a short-term rouse by our President and the Politics behind him, but we will see.

&gt;  
&gt;Its hilarious the kinds of things Americans will take credit for, and what things they think ""changed the world"" lol. IPhones changing the world? It's an innovation on two or three existing techs, and oh, Canada had blackberry first, maybe didn't take off, but sure as shit came first and all iPhone added was touch screen.

I'm not a fan of much of what Apple does, but the iPhone was the first usable phone with a touch-only interface allowing for a bigger screen.  The iPhone added more than a touch screen; importantly it had an OS that was designed with touch in mind. You're free to still use a Blackberry; why don't you?   And he was just giving you an example, anyway--AMD, Intel, American companies. Nvidia,   Apple, Microsoft, Google, I could go on and on.  You hurt your argument by dickswinging about fucking BLACKBERRY.   The only other country that really matters is in this space is Japan.  We should have teamed up during WWII and took over the rest of the world together, it's regrettable how history turned out.

&gt;For a country of 30 million, with a lot more fairness / less competition in our systems, I think we're doing damn good.

Leave it to a Canadian or European to think that less competition is a good thing.  No wonder your economy is relatively stagnant compared to ours.  And to fall back on something so touchy-feely and subjective as ""fairness,"" grow a fucking dick.

&gt;Then you state space exploration which you literally have Nazis you gave the choice of work for us, or die, to thank. And electric cars, which you credit to tesla... Run by/brainchild of a South African.

You exaggerate the contributions ""Nazis"" gave to the space race, massively so, because you have this cringey ""I hate America"" shit going on like most of the rest of the world; you devour our products, you eat our shit, and yet you hate us due to a massive inferiority complex and posturing by your leaders on the world stage who pretend to hate our foreign policy while relying on it to downsize and minimize your own militaries.

What you might not get, as a Canadian, is that we Americans view any naturalized citizen as an ""American.""  We don't care if someone is an immigrant and they invent something--if they live here, and are a citizen, they are just as American as the next person.  And disregarding that, who cares if Tesla had South American heritage?

Since you have  hard on for Blackberry, let's look at who started BlackBerry.  Mike Lazaridis, a born in Turkey and ethnically Greek, the other guy was a Canadian but held a much smaller part.  Oops, guess Blackberry is really a Turkish thing!

The fact that you're trying to claim Tesla is South African because the founder is from South Africa is laughable.  Really laughable.  In fact, Musk also holds Canadian citizenship; why didn't he found Tesla in Canada?  \*chuckle\*

Face it, bucko, all you got is maple syrup, eh?

&gt;The British (Alan Turing) have a lot to do with the invention of the first PC's..

So?  Nobody claims America invented everything; we just are the most successful at inventing stuff and have the largest economy.  And we have an economy and talent pool where this stuff thrives.  There's a reason Tesla is in America and not Canada (or South America).  You can sit around and pick your nose and ramble on about how your economy might suck but at least ""it's full of fairness"" and reminisce about the good old days of phones with physical minikeyboards but America is just, simply, #1.

&gt;  
If anything, your list is an example of how America takes good inventions, and makes them palatable to consumers. And just flat out taking credit for what's not yours.. Very American of you to not understand where all of these inventions came from, taking credit for others work.

This is starting to get really stupid.  The cringe is unreal.  Christ, you are so fucking whiny and jealous, it's unbelievable.  You're here masturbating over the Blackberry and then whining that America doesn't create anything when WE LITERALLY HAVE THE WORLD'S LARGEST ECONOMY.  Shopify and Blackberry are hilariously irrelevant compared to American companies.  If that's all you can think of, shucks, you made our argument for us.

Remember, Turkey invented the smart phone, because Blackberry was started by a guy from Turkey, just like how Tesla is a South African company.  Important takeaway from this amazing conversation.",HankAngus,wallstreetbets,73.0

165,2019-06-10,"AMD is gonna be about this price for a few months as cloud gaming news gets out as they're probably all gonna leverage their CPUs and/or GPUs.

Microsoft, Google, and Amazon (probably) are all gonna have their own cloud gaming systems. 

Google's Stadia is probably gonna fail at some point because I refuse to believe they'll ever make it user friendly enough to work properly. They can try and give special bundles with YouTube TV, Red, and Stadia, but won't for probably a few years and Stadia will die a slow death. Sure they have Google Cloud, but holy shit is it ugly to use.

Microsoft can use their position as OS market leader and with the Xbox and their influence with game developers to push their platform. Not only that, they have the most to gain outside of their actual gaming service as they could use it as a marketing opportunity for Azure.

Amazon probably has the most cash to burn and could leverage AWS's more expansive features to come out on top. Also, they could leverage Twitch/Amazon Prime to get a leg up. 

My opinion, however, is that whoever teams up with Valve will end up on top. Valve has done a lot of work with Proton (which would benefit Google and Amazon most) and has all your games already that you've bought. Maybe adding like a Humble Monthly subscription thing to Steam could work well.

Side note: I don't think game streaming will be good enough until 5G comes out and gigabit internet is ubiquitous.

AMD has a current market cap of 36.62B at their current stock price, where INTC has a market cap of 210.14B at their current stock price.  AMD has a P/E Ratio of 137.86 with YOY revenue for 2018 being around 6.5 billion, where INTC has a P/E ration of 10.60 with a YOY revenue of 70.8 billion.

So what you're saying by saying ""hype only"" is that AMD somehow deserves a P/E Ratio that's almost 38% higher than INTC while normalized revenues are 54% LOWER than INTC even if they had the same market cap.

Stocks are different. They are mostly index sensitive unless a piece of news hits. If you knew computex was around the corner for example, and bought AMD calls to capture whatever move came from that catalyst, you were lit.

Had one earnings week where I took 3500 in premium and it all expired.  That was cool.

Now I have built up a big position in NVDA (600 shares), because I figured AMD rallied for having no China exposure basically and NVDA got crushed, so I see more upside.

Let’s say you’re with TD Ameritrade, you’d need 125k to get portfolio margin to increase your stock buying power to 500k total. You also need to know how to actually trade. You’d have to be selling covered calls and puts constantly. Rules like never selling the calls below your average or entry price of the shares. AMD is a great high iv choice to do this- but like others said, it could post a bad earnings rn while people expect a lot and see it back to low 20’s. You do NOT want your average to be 30 if you’re on a loan with margin all in with an average of 29.5 you can’t sell 30 calls for enough money for “income” a week or two out if the stock is at 20. You’d need the rest of your capital to average down selling puts then, if you have reason to believe there’s support there and it isn’t going lower. If you havnt been trading for a long time profitably I’d suggest not to do this. Try ThinkOrSwim’s paper trading account and ask them to reduce your amount to the size of loan you’d get. If you bust ass and use your own 25k to hold shares and sell the covered calls or puts, that’s not bad and a choice for yourself to make.

&gt;The creation of the second, China-controlled joint venture allowed the parties to claim that the resulting product was indigenously developed in China, a key goal of the Chinese government.

44,2019-07-07,"So here's what I do, and i still lose money. But mostly profitable by looking for:

1) hot sector- sector rotation is real. When a sector is being rotated into, that's where you want to look for stocks

2) stocks that are outperforming their sector- so, hot stock in a hot sector.

Ex: semis are running and AMD has massively outperformed semis, take AMD. 

from here, I do one of two things, either: 

A) if the stock is still running up, I look for a bull flag. Quick Google search can show you the pattern. I like it because it's very easy to spot and is usually pretty reliable. 

Or

B) wait for a dip on that stock and buy it. I've found this works best if the stock has been running, hits a high, drops, and consolidates a bit. The hotter its been usually the better. 
Ex: OKTA reaches 130s, pulls back, trades around 119-121 for a week, you buy that. Its back at 127 and at this point I'd be scoping out bull flags to play the run. 

Ex2: AMD hits 34, pulls back, trades between 29 and 30 for a week or two. Buy that. Back at 31.5 now, another bull flag scenario I'd look for now.

67,2019-07-08,"the 5700xt trades blows in gaming with base 2070, and usually loses out to the 2070 super, I'm basing this of the gamersnexus review as well as here: https://www.techspot.com/review/1870-amd-radeon-rx-5700/

Ok so we have a $400 5700xt with a garbage cooler (according to reviews) which means the partner cards with good coolers will be $500ish.

It's competing with base 2070's for sub-$400 with good coolers, and 2070-S at $500 with good coolers.

Also consider that AMD is a no-go still for any deep learning applications and a large portion of miners.

Basically it's 5700xt partners card for $500 vs 2070S for $500 when the 2070S outperforms in the majority of situations. I think you're not taking the garbage stock cooler into account and over estimating how 'on par' it is with the 2070S",po-handz,wallstreetbets,67.0
68,2019-07-08,"What's the market share for personal computers (gamers) versus server/cloud computing (business) CPU's? Where does AMD get more of their revenue from (I personally don't know the answer)?

Because I'm pretty sure most video games are single-core focused and you're making this a bigger deal than it is. Intel has the upper hand on single core performance - hence the higher avg fps per games - and a larger market share. Sure, AMD is better bang for the buck (not by a lot), but intel still makes better gaming CPUs.

This 3900X is just a budget intel CPU with greater multi core performance. Sure, streamers who want to render 1080p 60fps videos in 2x the speed might want to grab this, but anyone who's just interested in 144hz 1440p gaming (which will be the market focus in the next \~2-3 years, in terms of audience) will buy an intel CPU for the single core performance.

93,2019-07-09,"Yep, the key was expecting price to go up in the wake of the launch of newest Ryzen. I knew before the launch that they would soundly beat Intel in multithreaded workloads and reach parity in single threaded.

I remember when the first Ryzen processors launched and AMD stock was in single digits. I thought about buying some before launch and decided against it, because I assumed everyone else knew Ryzen was coming and how badass it would be so gains were priced-in. I've stopped making those assumptions.

I geek out a bit less than I used to, but computers are my hobby, so I follow the news and rumors, especially when it comes to AMD. This means I've made some decent money by anticipating the market. I've bought options on things I don't know as well, like oil and banking, and lost money. 

So, I think the key is gambling on what you know, whether it's computer parts or cars or maritime insurance or marital aids. If it's your hobby or profession, there's a good chance you know more about it than the average investor (even the sophisticated ones), so might as well leverage that.

2,2019-07-11,"There's definitely a chance. I'm new to trading so I'm trying to use my janky coding skills (aka this data might be wrong) to see if I can't gather info from historical data. From what I'm gathering this is a weird time in the market though and with all of the good news for AMD who knows how often historical trends will hold up. Either way here's some more data:

The average close of the 5 days following a close that was up 2%+ was down  79.0004805382028 % of the time, being down an average of  -5.871132245506797 %
The average close of the 5 days following a close that was up 2%+ was up  20.51898125901009 % of the time, being up an average of  3.459706107134237 %
The average close of the 5 days following a close that was up 2%+ was the same  0.4805382027871216 % of the time

Meanwhile the average close of the 5 days following every trading day is up 57% of the time, so AMD trends upwards but has frequent pullbacks after going up quick. And with earnings coming up and such a high PE ratio, any disappointment will send the stock tumbling. I predict a pullback happening before earnings as people take their profits. Also I imagine Intel is going crazy trying to avoid AMD from taking too much of their market share and one good announcement from them could hurt AMD.

12,2019-07-11,"I don't think there is actual a bear gang. I think cautious has been misrepresented as bearish. I am not bullish just because job data is good and rate cuts initially only help the market for a short while. That being said like I said I am not bearish yet. You got to just respect the charts imo even though I am not a TA guy.

So as someone who is cautious I still trade many high growth stocks on the long side but in my investment portfolio I mainly have cash/bonds/gold/few utility stocks and 1-2 \*safe equities like MACD/DIS.  

Every time I think the market is too high I do buy a bit of protection on the side. Like yesterday I had AMZN/GOOGL/AMD calls, some which I sold and some I kept but I also bought some SQQQ calls that were RIDICULOUSLY cheap.

There is lots of uncertainty right now in the global economic system so you have to be a bit cautious just incase shit hits the fan like in 07-08.

If you do your research every now and then you hit a big winner like AMD or TSLA into the right direction and you turn $2000 into $4000 profit. Those are like one in a month kind of days. Once or twice a year you will hit a 500% bagger if the overall market and the sector you invest in all go up or down the way you predict for 2-3 days in a row.

Important think is don't hunt for the big winners, be happy taking 15% profit better then losing 30%. Every week there is at least 2 days that will kill option players on either side. If you go hunting for big winners on those days you will bankrupt yourself. That's also why you never go all in weeklies, pretend like your playing poker. Fold the bad hands and when you find the ideal setup like two queens in your hand and 2 queens on the board you can bet 10% of your account and go for a big day.

But don't expect to see anything for a while. Making Modems is among the toughest things to do in the Electrical Engineering business, and Intel modems were kinda known to be shit. The only way I see this going well for apple is if they manage to poach a bunch of people from Qualcomm, which they will probably do easily, as working at apple is a much larger flex than Qualcomm. I say long apple, but isnt really enough to affect short term calls and such.

82,2019-07-11,"I only learn from pain.  Lot’s of it.

So pre ~mid 2017 the only thing I did was trade shares and write options occasionally.  A good week for me was to be up 2%, great was being up 5%.  My main method was early in the week I would screen stocks that had moved down more than 2% in the last few days on no real news (no ER recently, no market wide reason, and no reason for the sector, and no reason for that stock specifically) and I would buy shares in that company.  More than 60% of the time within a week the stock would rebound and I would cash out.  Sometimes the rebound was quick and I might make 2% in a day, then do it again, and again, that was a 5% week for me.  Sure sometimes I’d pick wrong and it wouldn’t recover for weeks or months, and sometimes the slide continued so I absolutely suffered some losses, and I would say my “best” average was just barely beating what the SP500 would do in a year.

So I started shifting more to writing options more and more and a good week was ~2% for me.  My win rate (not losing money in a week) was much better but my average return was not as hot, and I did suffer some losses.  But overall it seemed more consistent.  I stayed away from selling naked, but I quickly realized I could buy shares on margin and write calls, so there was better return potential on writing calls versus writing puts (on covered puts you can’t utilize margin as collateral… yeah I could’ve done naked but didn’t want to).  Except I picked AMD when it went from $12/share down to $9.90/share from mid  into late 2017, and then I wrote calls at $10/share and they got called away.  So while I had some decent returns with this method I didn’t react with enough agility when I was in a losing trade with a significant part of my portfolio.

My saving grace in mid/late 2017 was that with a relatively small part of my portfolio I was being aggressive and made decent gains on other tickers, enough to offset the AMD losses and then some, and was able to avoid getting blown out in February mainly because I had most of my money in cash, and then I did pretty well until mid/late summer 2018.

Anyhow I learn every time a better way and then fuck it up.  So far this last 6 months I seem to be doing OK, mainly by having multiple tickers in multiple sectors and not playing too aggressively, but I’m still open to any sharp moves against me (May hurt).  Once I have enough capital I plan to go options writing only, but for now I keep trying to navigate my way there.  Let me know how it goes, I’m looking forward to it.",Gahvynn,wallstreetbets,82.0

I need AMD to hit low 34s to be around break even on Monday, touch 34 to be ""only"" -20% instead of -50%.

1. A stock that moves 1 penny at a time. For me this was AMD back when I played the game. It would move between. 5.20 and 5.21 (for example) all day long.
2. Put your entire portfolio (and margin if possible) when the stock is 5.20.
3. Sell when it hits 5.21
4. Quickly open a short position at 5.21 on the same stock
5. Wait till it drops to 5.20

61,2019-08-02,"You buy 100 shares of a company. Sell a call on those 100 shares. For something cheap like $AMD, that’s only a $3,000 up front investment. So you sell covered (you own the shares) calls on a stock and collect the premium. If they exercise you likely got a nice premium. If they don’t you keep the shares and resell the call again for more premium. 

Doing this with something highly violative will yield higher premiums, but with the added risk of exercise.",I_Know_KungFu,wallstreetbets,61.0

14,2019-08-03,"Wow, I'm going to assume you are sincere and not just trying to troll me. Be wary of the ""big corporations"" stereotype. They originally started as public/private entities for public works projects and building bridges, shit like that. The computer or device you are using was designed and built by a corporation. The company who delivered it is a corporation. You can essentially form your own personal corporation with an LLC. 

This notion that Amazon and everything and everybody will be automated and roboticized out of job; to whom is Amazon going to sell stuff to to generate the taxes to subsidize people who aren't working? Robots are simply a tool to make people more productive. 

I would prefer a sales tax and property tax exemption/voucher equal to $1000 for means tested people or people who are in school, job training/retraining. No redistribution necessary. It would need to be an actual means test and not just income. There was a retired millionaire who recently applied for food stamps and got them because assets didn't apply, only income. 

Inflation related to monetary policy you need to research the Federal Reserve.

https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm

UBI wouldn't be the same thing as the Fed creating money, but it would still drive up prices on any good with scarcity.

82,2019-08-06,"&gt; According to my sources, Lisa Su is eyeing the #2 position at IBM with the eventual goal to end up as CEO and President of IBM, replacing Ginni Rometty. The advanced groundwork for this transition has apparently already been laid down as you will read further in this article. While I do not know the exact reasons for why Lisa would choose IBM of all companies to move to, I am told that this is something that she has wanted for a very long time.

&gt;Lisa Su is planning to launch AMD’s Rome CPUs tomorrow and from everything we have heard so far, it is going to be a resounding success. Leaving the company in a technically and financially sound condition means that her successor should have a fairly easy job until Intel rolls out its response to AMD’s Zen parts. Lisa, however, was not completely satisfied with replacements existing within AMD and this is where a recent hiring comes into play.

&gt; AMD recently brought on Rick Bergman, former CEO of Synaptics, as the lead for the PC and Semi-Custom business and the real reason, or so I am told, was for Lisa Su to prepare a successor to take over the reins once she leaves. Rick Bergman would make an excellent candidate considering his past experience with AMD and Synaptics, and is exactly the kind of grounded personality the company requires moving forward.

AMD was trading reliably at the 32-34 range for weeks leading up to Q2 ER, they met estimates and beat on revenue but were lukewarm on guidance so they gapped down. Then Trump tariff-twatted, Chinese went currency nuclear and the market tanked. 

The “Rome” launch presser was pretty damn significant imo. They showcased a DOD contract, expanded with Google, Twitter, and Microsoft data centers, they focused on how EPYC outperforms Intel, and they announced ambitious timeframes for “Milan” and “Genoa.”

Well I was going to play LYFT earnings and had 2 contracts of 67.5 which I cashed out at close and didn't play LYFT earnings. So I am happy since they would have been IV crushed.

STMP: pretty much going to hold both options until expiry (30p and 70c). If they keep their gains, expect a squeeze on STMP.

MSFT calls: 137c fd, will take a call EOD tomorrow to cut or let it run through Friday.

w.r.t swinging stocks

Swinging AMZN since 1776 (ha tht worked out)

AMD (in at 28.88). Hoping these gains hold and Su Bae showers me with tendies.. might update stops to get the most out of this.

\----------------

No TA or anything: But have a feeling DIS is going to start moving up soon.. Might take 3-4 days.

\-----------------

Ok TIME for some TA... now please bear in mind that this is just TA and one news event or tweet will run this. But if no bad news etc happens..  VISA($V) and MSFT ($MSFT) are looking RIPE to move up after being oversold on many TA indicators (MACD,RSI,Full STO)

CNBC broke out the yuan news flipping futures. Lets see what happens. Today's market red to green showed that the market was going through price discovery and might just rip up tomorrow.

But then RANDOMLY my research led me to .a Youtube channel with over 10K subs who is known to be a veritable source talking about the Epyc Rome launch event that didn't even have an official date or time anywhere to be found. And in the comments there was a thread was talking about how this could be where they announce the Google partnership.",Adios_numero_two,wallstreetbets,42.0

310,2019-08-08,"For me an epic short has to be a bet against something *everyone* has faith in or didn't see coming. Something like if you'd caught GE or Deutsche Bank before their share prices collapsed.

I think the most logical targets would be the Chinese mega caps like BABA and Tencent, but Chinese government won't let those collapse. At the least I wouldn't trust any PnL or numbers from them. Who's going to call them out for fraud?

Tesla is the short everyone keeps waiting on but never happens. 

Under normal circumstances a great candidate right now is Boeing, because I feel more stuff is going to come out regarding impropriety around the 737-Max. But, they're so important to national security and industrial manufacturing I feel there's a floor.

AMZN may have a big drop if Bezos and Trump can't make nice. But wouldn't count on it.

I'm not too well versed in semis but I'm starting to feel Intel is going to find itself in a weird position. Sold off the 5G smart phone modem business and AMD is breathing down its neck with new competitive products and there's tons of competition in the networking space.

Watched it slowly creep down and sold the rest around the 34.70 range.

Lastly, market cap is NOT a CURRENT valuation of a company but a **FORWARD LOOKING** valuation therefore if a company's market cap increase by 30% overnight, it doesn't mean they hold that cash instantly, it means within the next 5-10 years, they are going to grow to fit that size.",Adios_numero_two,wallstreetbets,146.0

BABA is gonna soar. Its over due. 2 years ago BABA hit 170-200 range. Since then revenue is up 150% and earnings have doubled.

Their growth is insane for a company of their size and they will grow with the Chinese economy (6.2% gdp growth June) and internationally.

They make most of their money domestically so tariffs aren't a big deal. 
Alipay is massive and has 54% market share.
Their cloud is up 76% YoY.

Another thing to consider is the growth of amazon, ebay, ecommerce.

Look at their products and try to find them on Aliexpress or Alibaba.com

14,2019-08-13,"but they are not guaranteed to do the same in GPU. They are improving, but they have released like 3 new lines of GPU in 2 years  (compared to ONE for Nvidia). Each line has pretty much peaked at the power of the 3 year old 1080 card from Nvidia... Nvidia also currently has the GPU render community on lock (and I think a lot of scientific programs). 

Considering that Nvidia is racing towards AI (which I think they most likely partially lucked into in the first place?), I highly doubt that they are siting on their ballsacks like Intel did. I don't think we will see an AMD graphics chip best the top of the line Nvidia for the next 5 years. Nvidia is pulling an intel in that they aren't releasing things overly quickly so that they can drive up margins, but IMO they are always keeping something in the chamber in case AMD drops something big that they weren't aware was coming. Plus, if they can push ray tracing via RTX and get it to be mass accepted in the next gen or two, they'll have even more market share in the PC space.

Spy puts at open on Tuesday. Hoping we are still around 290-292 so I can ride it down over the week.

FSLY calls at open on Tuesday after seeing how the first 15 minutes look. 

COST calls. Looking at $305c 10/4. Will see if it can dip lower before buying in. Earnings are on 10/3. I think it can carry to over $305 before then and then will have positive ER as well with great guidance. 

Of course if whit gets crazy bad fast I will abandon and just focus on puts for SPY and  tech like AAPL MSFT and AMD

3,2019-09-02,Lots of reasons.  You might wanna hedge with an entirely different product in order to improve r/r.  Hedging SPY puts with AMD calls for example.  You might hedge a long term bullish position with some cheap short duration puts during a news event or data dump or whatever.  The goal is to protect whatever position you have.

13,2019-09-02,"I had a difficult time finding a way to organize the data, so the best way to put it was by calling it a yield. 

I will do an in depth explanation when the tool is ready, but in short you can see how much an option costs at x % out of the money. The data is sorted so you can read it very easily. You can also see what that same option price was at x% out of the money last week (so you can see how much an option price has changed due to a trump tweet or other market factors that affects volatility).

As an example, you want to look at the AMD option for September 27. Say the AMD stock price today is at $30. You can see that %5 OTM PUT option (at $28.50 strike) is trading for 4% yield (4% of $30 current price = $1.20).
You can then look at the history of this option from say 3-4 weeks ago and compare it to how much yield the option was offering at 5% OTM back then. Because there was a little more time value in the option, it was probably offering slightly more yield, let’s say 6%. Also let’s say 3-4 weeks ago AMD was trading at $37.00. So the 6% yield would mean the put option price was 6% of $37 = $2.22 at 5% OTM ($35 ish strike price)

You would be able to compare the way trump tweets, earnings dates, etc affect pricing of an option and how much of a yield they are offering over the duration of the life of the option. 

I wanted to make this tool because it reduces the amount of time you spend actually looking at the data either on Yahoo Finance/Nasdaq or your broker’s App.",swaggymedia,wallstreetbets,13.0

16,2019-09-02,"Honestly I'm not at all any professional, I've just seen the same shit everytime.. options expire worthess unless you bought them before a major news herd buy, or squeeze etc..

  


I've seen the same thing happen over and over again with dips..

  


We just had a 20% drop, does the market crash 2 or 3 times in 1 year and how many times does it drop %20 in a year??

  


I see that options are worth selling instead of buying for what I want out of the market..

  


We all want to Yolo and make $30,000 in one day, but you can only buy on insider news or get real lucky for a stock to jump 5% or more in 1 day and on top of that it has to keep going up and not have any pullback or else the option decays so fast you cant even believe how the stock can be up but your call is just whatever..

  


I've just seen the drops and the buy up pumps. I've seen the squeezes.. BYND, Tilray, AMD, and a bunch I cant even remember, but they all did the same thing, nvidia, Netflix, .. they try to take money.

  


Snap, GE, and many more . All just doing things they shouldn't..

  


Blah blah, point is I've seen futures rally overnight from 3am to 8am onky to fly even higher during the whole day..

  


I've seen the market drop 400 points and end the day up 400 points same day..

  


I'm no expert or claim to know it all, but I've just experienced some stupid shit and now I get it..

  


You always want the market to go up, and you never want to buy until the crashes and huge drops..

  


You always want to have things work for you (theta and decay work for you) and you if you want to yolo, just buy 1 week or less after the options are $0.10 or less..

  


I've just seen some shady stuff and hilarious stuff fo on in the market..

  


Halts on stocks for really stupid things yet other stocks that have such volatile days way more than ever and they dont get halted at all..

  


I could go on forever ..

  


But again the point is, you always want the market to go up and you always want to be in as low as possible..

  


I crave and pray and hope sooooo bad for another 20% drop so we can all just get in again..

  


I didn't take full advantage of that December drop and it still gets me that I was sitting watching it all through December and was too much of a pussy to go all in.. well knowing that the market is always about going up.. it will never just go to $0.. it will always rebound..

  


So I dont know why we would ever be scared or even care about any drops or red days at all.. remember a huge red day is a huge buying opportunity (or selling put spread day for me!!

  


Catch my drift .",Frogs-and-Frags,wallstreetbets,16.0
17,2019-09-02,"I dont have a serious strategy and it doesn't always work.. all I've seen and noe do though is watch when the market takes bigger dips and then sell pit put spreads ..

  


  


We just had a 650 point drop on the Dow 2 Fridays ago.. that's a perfect opportunity to sell put spreads expiring st the earliest and shortest time frame..

  


When Disney dtopped near $131, another perfect opportunity, when AMD drops to $24 or around there, perfect.. etc etc..

  


When Tesla goes down a bit, more opportunity.. it's just catching drops of 2% to 10% and selling the crap out of puts that expire the shortest possible time..

  


Especially on TQQQ..

82,2019-09-04,don't buy short term contracts. It's fun because you don't have to wait around and you don't have to see your money shoot up and down but it limits the places you can get out and turn a profit. I bought SQ and BOX calls last week because I was testing a strategy where I buy long term calls for undervalued stocks/growth stocks and reel in tendies as time passes. I knew BOX had potential to be bought out so while having an activist investor come in was quite lucky and seems to have reversed poor earnings it makes a lot of sense. I want to test this strategy out on the trade war so I'm looking at calls for $CAT $BA $MMM $AAPL and $AMD and will probably get in next time Mango decides to drop the market 500 points with a tweet storm at Xi/China,kkooddaakkjjaacckk,wallstreetbets,82.0

The next, after optimism from an event, the same options were up 16,400%. I couldn't make this up. Check prices right before epyc event and after.

Gold I can almost see why, but silver?! Please.. nobody gives a shit about silver..

Look we are all waiting for lower prices in the stock market and so any next big 20% down drop would be welcome..


If your theory is correct, then I fear the computers and the quantitative easing bullshit will just have the market slowly back pedal and chop up and down to stay where it is essentially doing nothing.

This would mean even more reason to sell options instead of buying them so theta makes you money instead of options losing value when you buy them and hold them..

Also all bugger red days, like the Dow down 600+ points days, we all should be buying anyway to get good stocks like Disney, Apple AMD and etc..

Don't forget to load up on TQQQ on huge red days.

People are clamoring on about calls before tomorrow's event (me included) but there are also people still holding onto puts. If AMD starts going up you're going to see a lot of bullish comments ""now we go to the moon"" ""sue baeeeeeee takin me for a ride"" and if AMD starts going back down you're going to see a lot of bearish comments ""drillin Su Bae"" ""keep goin down bb""


Whenever the mkt is doing what someone wants, they are happy, and post more. The two types of comments we see here are the super pessimistic ""I'm walking out on my family before my wife kills me for betting our six houses on stonks"" and the comments that align with what hte market is doing at that moment. So this morning when the mkt was bullish, we saw more bullish comments as those people were happy and confident and trending up.

35,2019-10-02,"&gt;As a person that has worked in the banking industry for four years in the past,

It takes a pulse and a basic level of not being 'pants on head retarded' to work at a bank.

&gt; Moreover, an agent that has the credentials to work in an office is not a scrub that makes $20 per hour. 

Those ""scrubs"" make more money than 30% of America.

&gt;They are not going to risk their financial security to release information like that to their clients. Just saying, this was the case at JP Morgan Chase and Merrill Lynch BOA 

_meanwhile at wells fargo, Citi, TD, BB&amp;T, Santander, PNC_

&gt;This economy is going no where - at least not until trade deals are finalized.

14,2019-10-03,"AMD, it'd be like $3000~ assignment risk given that the stock is around $30. It depends on what strikes you pick for the puts you sell. It has decent IV and the stock is cheap enough that you can sell a few contracts unless you're real poor, then just do vertical spreads (my favorite strategy).

Typically what I do is sell puts 5-10% OTM, depending on the type of credit I'd receive, 30-45 days out. Almost like a monthly dividend if you want to think of it like that. If I get assigned, I sell calls for even more credit.

It works well on stocks like Microsoft, mainly because it doesn't move all that much and if I get more Microsoft I don't really mind as I'm pretty much all in on my boy Satya Nutella.

I also don't tend to hold my short calls/puts to expiration, if I sell a put/call and the shit is up like 50% relatively fast (still has like 20 days to expiration or some shit), I'll just close it and wait to sell it again.

I don't think it'll be Mango who plays hard here -- it'll be China. Trump doesn't have leverage anymore and China has a longer view than the next 13 months. 13 months is basically nothing to 🐉 Land of 5000 Years 🐲, they can wait it out.

&gt;Impeachment talk is all noise with an R Senate

I don't know. Trump is rapidly becoming toxic (even more toxic than usual) and you're seeing a lot of R senators just not saying shit at all about this situation. The typical lickspittles are spouting their insane conspiracy theories, but there's also about 20 or so Senators who have just vanished and are refusing to speak to the media. That doesn't bode well to me.

You're also seeing people like Flake saying that if it was a secret ballot, 🥭 absolutely would get impeached. Do I think Republicans want to get rid of Mango, wash their hands of him, and have a President Pence and pretend Trump never happened? Absolutely, yeah.

9,2019-10-05,"Step 1. Go to [SwaggyStocks.com](https://www.swaggystocks.com) 

Step 2. Go to “Options” -&gt; Options Scanner

Step 3. On the options scanner page, search by “Options yields” (first search filter). Select how far out you are looking to sell options and order by “yield descending”.

Step 4: Scroll through the calls/puts depending which direction you are looking to go. You’ll be able to find stocks you recognize (stocks you know).

Step 5: The “yield” is basically how much premium you are going to collect relative to how much you will risk. Aka a stock priced at $100 with 5% yield brings in $5 per $100 of risk.

Step 6: Combine the “Yield Scanner” with some of your own analysis, either fundamental or technical, to find how you will implement a strategy.

For example, looking at AMD two weeks out we can see that selling a put 5% OTM will give us a 1.95% return.

Times that by 10 and you made 300 dollars and it may not hit that strike price so your producing free cash flow. That’s not a bad idea but me personally I’d set it up in spreads. Collect a big premium on an ITM call with an expiration far out then some calls OTM for less premium. Now if you hypothetically know AMD is going down then you’ll keep your shares and money but if it does stay ITM on one call you could still have 9 others that never hit their targets.

1. buy 100 shares of AAPL and sell monthly OTM covered call options

2. buy 1000 shares of AMD and sell monthly OTM covered call options

I will choose a strike price that yield roughly equal % return, but AAPL pays a dividend and is way more stable whereas AMD can go to $50 and back to $30 in a month. Another thing to consider is AAPL is at their historic ATH and come next week will most likely drop a few % due to people taking profits.

2,2019-11-02,I made mistakes too. Bought AMD calls and didn't hold. Stock went down and I got nervous so sold. But stock hit 35 today and I could have cashed in. You make mistakes but you learn from them. Buy itm options every time and buy far out exp.,jakersthepig,wallstreetbets,2.0
3,2019-11-02,"Don't quit, I'll tell you a strat. Be the seller of calls, then use the proceeds to play and have fun with.

Let's look at AMD, it is going up like gangbuster, so we are finding ourselves at 34.9x or something. Buy 100 shares on Monday at roughly 34.45 or about there. The minute the shares are in your hand, sell Dec 20 C35. You will receive a handsome premium that you shouldn't receive, but because of the price pendulum swinging up, it the call seller market. Sit back for a month and watch the action, if you get call away at $35, you don't lose a penny and net about 10% from the premium. If not, you get the premium free and even if the share collapse, you can sell lower call, while not losing any real capital to start with.

Do this with BAC and you will also get DIV while you wait. Rinse and repeat.",dotme,wallstreetbets,3.0
4,2019-11-02,"If you want, you can buy 100 amd stocks and start selling covered calls.  You can sell a 36$ weekly call, collect the premium, and hope it expires worthless.  Even if your call goes in the money, you'd still make all of the premium and get 3600$ if your call gets exercised.  Then with all the new cash you just got, you can sell an amd put!!

18,2019-11-01,"&gt;My second question is, would another brokerage have stopped me somewhere? I know “guh” guy was stupid but the above seems negligent on RH’s part.

Yeah.  They would have.  Buying power is calculated based on the cash and margin available in your account.     
Typical margin is 2x equity.  
So in contro\_dude's case he put in $2k.  Typically in a real brokerage he'd be able to by like $4k worth of stock.  Since he bought like $3800 worth of AMD, the most he could purchase additionally is $200.   The short adds to his cash.  But the short doesn't add to this buying power b/c first, options are not marginable and the value of the option (b/c it's a short position) goes against your equity position.

Typically you have to have enough equity/cash to cover the max loss of a position either long call/put or spreads.",unclefire,wallstreetbets,18.0

81,2019-11-01,"With Robinhood Gold, you can use what's called Margin to trade with increased Buying Power. So I did an instant deposit of 2000 dollars (the minimum required to access Gold Trading), and then I bought 100 shares of AMD for 3,800 or so, with margin.

If I'm looking at this correctly, you can't actually generate unlimited margin. This is because the value of 100 shares will always be greater than the value of the 100 most ITM calls. For instance, AMD is $35/share, 100 shares is $3500, you need this collateral to sell your ITM calls. The most autistic call you can sell is 1/15/2021 AMD strike @ $3 for $31.90/contract (3190). So you have to spend $3500 of RH's money to generate $3190. So you can only perform this recursion this many times: 1/(1 - 3190/3500) = 11.3 times. With 2x leverage from initial deposit, you're @ 22.6x leverage. This is likely why he didn't just go to infinite margin.",Themaninak,wallstreetbets,112.0

162,2019-11-01,"Not quite. Let’s assume you hold $10,000 of AMD in the account. AMD has a 30% margin requirement, which means in a margin account, you have to have deposited $3,000 in the account. This is way oversimplifying it but it’ll do. At this point, there is no margin buying power because the account is fully leveraged. You have 30% equity in the account. By writing a call, let’s say you get $2,000 from the premium. That’s an additional $2,000 of equity you now have in the account, which if no other accounting is done, would open up buying power because you’re not fully leveraged anymore. The missing step for RH is reflecting the value of the contract, which is also near $2,000 because that’s what you sold it for, as a negative number in the holdings. So when you receive the $2,000 premium, the -$2,000 holding in the account prevents your personal equity in the account from going up $2,000 and fraudulently opening up more buying power. Your equity would still be $3,000 in an account still worth $10,000, still fully leveraged.

198,2019-11-01,"With Robinhood Gold, you can use what's called Margin to trade with increased Buying Power. So I did an instant deposit of 2000 dollars (the minimum required to access Gold Trading), and then I bought 100 shares of AMD for 3,800 or so, with margin. Then I sold an AMD Call Contract with a 2 dollar price strike to get almost all my money back (it's important to find a stock that has Call Options with such low strike prices like Ford, GE, etc). Then I use that money to buy TWO hundred shares of AMD because remember, margin doubles my buying power, then I sell 2 Call Contracts witht he same 2 dollar strike price to get almost all my money back, which is then doubled again thanks to Robinhood's Margin. I repeat this until I am sufficiently leveraged for my Personal Risk Tolerance. Right now, I am at 25x leverage because I had 2000 dollars in Instant Deposits. I then use my increased buying power to maximize my gains.

199,2019-11-01,"He used a RH loophole to ramp up leverage 25X.

Basically with RH gold you have 100% margin on your deposit, so op bought 100 shares of AMD with 2K deposit, sold amd 2C options, get back his 3K and now has 6K margin, buy 200 shares on margin with the credit, rinse &amp; repeat.

OP did it until he had leveraged 50K from his 2K initial deposit",FredWeedMax,wallstreetbets,199.0

202,2019-11-01,"Yeh I’m familiar with covered calls. So he deposits $2k, buys $4k AMD stock on margin, sells covered calls on it. But that would yield a smaller premium right, not the entire $4k? What am I missing? Unless he wrote deep ITM calls? Is that right?",dingodoyle,wallstreetbets,202.0
203,2019-11-01,"He bought AMD stock on margin, used the stock as collateral to sell covered calls, used proceeds to purchase more AMD stock and sold covered calls again until he got to about $50k and bought AAPL puts with 1.5 days til expiry and lost it all unless AAPL tanks today.",BB4567,wallstreetbets,203.0

205,2019-11-01,"Are you familiar with covered calls?

Basically you deposit $1k with your bank, and they match your deposit 1:1, so you can buy a car worth $2k. You buy a car worth $2k, and then sell the pink slip for that car, receiving $2k. Now your bank matches it 1:1 again, and you buy a car worth $4k. You sell the pink slip, receiving $4k, and then you buy a car worth $8k.

Rinse and repeat till you’ve borrowed $48k from your bank with just a $2k deposit, and yolo it on lottery tickets and proceed to lose everything

Car = AMD shares, Pink slips = Covered Calls, Bank = RH",4dr14n,wallstreetbets,205.0

23,2019-11-02,"That strat I mentioned is a conservative strat, and one of many I am deploying, part of my Personal Risk Tolerance ^(TM).

With this particular strat, you actually want the share to drop, maybe not 28, but go ahead go down to 32 or 31, that is within the ""EASY MONEY"" pendulum. In fact, I wish it will go down, meaning the premium are free, I can also buy back the option and redeploy again within the quarter, maybe up to 5x, before a concrete ER comes into the picture and move the share to a new threshold, lower or higher. If the broad market is being pumped as it is now, the next quarter should sustain at the new higher range of 35-40 for AMD and 30 to 35 easily for BAC.

AMD Dec 20 C35 is selling for 1.92 as of this writing, let's say 2.00, that is a \~6% profit against 3500 risk. That should ensure that you won't lose a penny from now till Dec 20th if AMD doesn't collapse beyond 33. If Dec 20th comes around and AMD is 34.99 or lower, you get that $200 for free. Another covered call writes at 34 will yield you around $100 at least expiring into Jan 2020.

You can use this strat successfully against the S&amp;P 500, the PCG of the world requires a more aggressive play and shorter timeframe as the share price is being manipulated.",dotme,wallstreetbets,23.0

People poured through his history and he traded up pretty well getting a 100k amd position before yoloing it on the aapl puts.

Either what he did was incredibly smart or he was incredibly retarded (like maybe he just happened to sell a $2 call and got lots of money added to his buying power and didn't realize the implications that RH was double counting both the cash and shares.)

""With Robinhood Gold, you can use what's called Margin to trade with increased Buying Power. So I did an instant deposit of 2000 dollars (the minimum required to access Gold Trading), and then I bought 100 shares of AMD for 3,800 or so, with margin. Then I sold an AMD Call Contract with a 2 dollar price strike to get almost all my money back (it's important to find a stock that has Call Options with such low strike prices like Ford, GE, etc). Then I use that money to buy TWO hundred shares of AMD because remember, margin doubles my buying power, then I sell 2 Call Contracts witht he same 2 dollar strike price to get almost all my money back, which is then doubled again thanks to Robinhood's Margin. I repeat this until I am sufficiently leveraged for my Personal Risk Tolerance. Right now, I am at 25x leverage because I had 2000 dollars in Instant Deposits. I then use my increased buying power to maximize my gains.""",eOvrUsr,wallstreetbets,51.0

12,2019-11-04,"Here's the short version (still long)

1.  He had 2k in RH

2. This allowed him 2k in margin from RH gold

3.  He used this to buy 100 shares of AMD

4.  He sold an ITM call for 3k (or something)

5. (KEY POINT). RH thinks he has 7k (2k margin), but he does not.  The original 4k will be needed when he gets assigned.  Those calls are ITM with a strike of $2 or something.

6.  Now that RH thinks he has 7k, he can borrow another 3k.  Combined with the 3k from selling the call, he has 6k.

7.  He buys more AMD and sells a call and gets his margin cap increased over and over until he has 12,000 AMD shares selling 120 covered calls.  And now he can borrow (somehow) more margin

8. He YOLO's all the borrowed money on AAPL puts which drop and he is immediately margin called.

He bought AMD shares and sold deep in the money calls which gave him money back.  The loophole was that RH thought this was new money didn't realize it would have to be paid out to cover the calls when they became assigned. 

So RH, thinking this was new money, allowed him borrow more.  He then repeated the process until he had borrowed 100k of RH's money.  

50k was tied up in the AMD accounting fraud.  And the remaining 50k was put into AAPL options.  Had AAPL ended the day down or had he bought calls, he might have gotten away with it.  In fact he was up the day before and RH did not notice what he had done.

You can make money on the stock going up in this period, but the ultimate goal is to make money on the theta premium. Try to do it with a stock that you think won't completely melt, biggest risk is you get assigned a bunch of shares and the price falls off a cliff.

35,2019-11-03,"If you look at AMD options prices you can sell calls expiring in a week that are $0.50 to $1.00 out of the money for $60-80.
I actually repeated what the OP did to see if it was possible and got $100k of AMD shares with only $15k of my own money. I closed the position the next day, but with OP's $50k buying power that he gambled away, he could have purchased 1500 shares of amd and sold 15 calls against them expiring in a week for $900-$1200. Repeat weekly or extend the expiration date for a few thousand in premium a month.
I currently do this with 1100 AMD shares myself.
There are a few problems that I believe could bite you in the ass if you go full retard like Op:
1. If your account balance is only a few thousand but you have 100k of AMD with crazy margin, and AMD drops 10% after this massive bull run... The high premium $2 strike calls you sold to get the buying power will go down in price and you won't really lose money there because they're super deep ITM and they have high delta. BUT the other $50k or whatever that you're selling weekly calls on will not be as protected by your covered calls. The shares dropping will hit you harder than the gains from the calls. This could provide an ideal opportunity to buy them back for cheap and wait for another good day to resell, BUT if we're talking about insane leverage like OP, the drop may completely erase your account value and you'll get fucked by the broker. 
2. If AMD stays down for a while you're now in a risky situation because the original plan was to sell calls 0.5-1.0 out of the money for that juicy premium. If you get impatient and do that when AMD is $3 below where you bought it, you could get assigned by a small bump up and have to sell for a loss- big RIP. With the super leverage this could be thousands of dollars in losses you can't afford to lose.
I would not recommend trying to imitate OP, I was just pointing out that IF you were actually retarded and wanted to go crazy with margin, there are certainly safer ways to do it than betting it all on an earnings announcement. If AMD stays high and continues to climb or trade flat then great, but the options are priced high for a reason- the shits volatile and could just as easily fuck you.",AAnderson22,wallstreetbets,35.0

63,2019-11-04,"I have held onto all my losers and sold my winners at a break even. This month has been awful and it made me realize that I actually have a gambling problem. This community is awesome and I’ll continue to check in and laugh at the ridiculous shit you guys somehow get into but I’ll be playing along with a lot less capital.

I held onto my spy puts, I sold my Netflix calls on the day they got upgraded, I sold my AMD dec 20 calls 2 days after earnings, I bought intel puts, I sold my Disney calls near the bottom, and I bought beyond meat calls for some fucking reason that I’ll never understand. I’ve been fucked so hard by MCD it’s not even funny and I got theta fucked on my Tesla puts. All in all I’m down 5k and it’s 5k I realize now that I couldn’t afford to lose.

I just want to say to everyone that gambling is fun and it’s super fun when you win and it can even be tolerable when you lose. Just make sure that losing is an option and you can play again even if you do. I got into this rut of “well my portfolio isn’t at an all time high” so I would all in on some play and it worked for a long time. I started at 6k and worked my way all the way to 15k after all inning whenever I had a 20% loss and it worked. This time was different and I lost it all and I’m now resorting to 0 day spy puts to try to make it back which I know won’t work.  

I’ll be back next year when I can put more money in my Roth and hopefully I’ll stick to the rules I set for myself when I started this time but failed to adhere to.

I did the math and if i had just followed my own rules I would be at around 8k right now which is a hell of a lot better than where I’m at now.

Basically you deposit $1k with your bank, and they match your deposit 1:1, so you can buy a car worth $2k. You buy a car worth $2k, and then sell the pink slip for that car, receiving $2k. Now your bank matches your funds 1:1 again, and you buy a car worth $4k. You sell the pink slip, receiving $4k, and then you buy a car worth $8k.

Rinse and repeat till you’ve borrowed $48k from your bank with just a $2k deposit, and yolo it and proceed to lose everything. This shouldn’t be possible with a real broker, but RH sucks 

Car = AMD shares, Pink slips = call options, Bank = RH

&gt; With Robinhood Gold, you can use what's called Margin to trade with increased Buying Power. So I did an instant deposit of 2000 dollars (the minimum required to access Gold Trading), and then I bought 100 shares of AMD for 3,800 or so, with margin. Then I sold an AMD Call Contract with a 2 dollar price strike to get almost all my money back (it's important to find a stock that has Call Options with such low strike prices like Ford, GE, etc). Then I use that money to buy TWO hundred shares of AMD because remember, margin doubles my buying power, then I sell 2 Call Contracts witht he same 2 dollar strike price to get almost all my money back, which is then doubled again thanks to Robinhood's Margin. I repeat this until I am sufficiently leveraged for my Personal Risk Tolerance. Right now, I am at 25x leverage because I had 2000 dollars in Instant Deposits.

8,2019-11-06,"Tagging /u/JordanLeDoux 

This is the best explanation and example that I've found.  I still have a couple questions though.

When you sell an option, don't you always try to make a little money (however small) assuming that the underlying share price doesn't move at all until expiration?  In the example, AMD is at $38 and the account owner sells the $2 call option for $31.  So if AMD stays at $38 until expiration, the counterparty exercises the call by paying $2 to the account owner and the account owner transfers the 100 AMD shares to the counterparty.  In the end, the account owner has paid $38 for AMD stock and made only $31 + $2 = $33 afterward.  Is it realistic for anyone to sell an option like that?  I would think it would be more realistic if he sold a $2C call option at something like $36.10 so that he at least in theory can make $0.10 per share if the AMD share price doesn't change from $38.  Of course, this doesn't change the problems with RH.  

How do you get the Margin BP of $8900 at the end?  So the account owner makes $3100 cash from selling the call option.  Then RH mistakenly counts (instead of subtracts) the value of the stocks held that those short calls ""depend on,"" so that adds $3800.  And then another $2000, the original money that the account owner deposited? 

Also, how do you get the Margin BP of ($500) for the ""What they should be"" version at the end?  (I'm really not familiar with margin borrowing calculations.)  So we have the account owner selling a $2C call option for $31.  Just as another example, what if instead of doing that, the account owner simply held AMD and AMD fell to $33.  I would think that this means that the owner's cash has gone down from $2000 to $1500 and the borrowed money remains at $1800.  If the account owner only has $1500 of his own money in the account now, RH would only want to lend him $1500 instead of $1800, so they would want do a margin call for $300.  So would that be a Margin BP of ($300)?  (I'm really not sure...)  In both cases (selling $2C option at $31 and not selling an option and just holding AMD as it falls to $33), there is a P/L of ($500), so I would think the affect on Margin BP would be the same.",conjyak,wallstreetbets,8.0

Console chips are extremely low margin and it's only end of cycle where they become profitable.

&gt; It sounds like you are ignoring process and architecture.

I'm one of the only ones factoring both.

AMD cannot pay TSMC more than Intel charges itself and sell their chips cheaper than Intel. It's just basic math. Maybe they can produce the most powerful chips but that argument only matters for single core speed which Intel still wins using old fabrication processes. For multicore (where AMD shines) all that matters is price/performance and Intel can always undercut AMD **if they need to**.

1) Buy Stock
2) Sell deep ITM calls on said stock (this is basically selling the stock, but you get the money a bit in advance)
3) Use some of the money to buy *more* stock, increasing your margin limit

At the end, he had a pile of AMD stock that's cancelled out by his call obligations, and a pile of cash that's cancelled out by debt to RobinHood (secured by the pile of about-to-vanish stock).

That meant he could buy even more AMD stock on margin, and still have leftover ""cash"".  I put it in quotes because the calls will quickly force him to sell the AMD for far less than he bought it for, and RH would seize back the premium from selling the calls in a margin call.  

At the end of the day, he has an ephemeral pile of AMD stock that's going to vanish as soon as the calls are exercised (and at $2, they *will* be), but he has a day or two to maybe profit from a quick ""death or glory"" AAPL earnings play using the make-believe money.",gbs5009,wallstreetbets,165.0

You should take a step back from the financials and chartists, look at their product side. They're pushing a roadmap to make an honest attack at Intel's share, and it's working.

Chartists will tell you this mania will die like it has the past 2 times (see historicals), and that may be true, but I don't see a drop like 2000 or mid-2000 coming. Intel can't even get a solid 10nm desktop OR server architecture. AMD is signing contracts *already* to take server share.

Alone, RH PRT users abusing the loop won’t move the price much, but multiple algos would notice the consistent buy orders and buy shares themselves anticipating more share purchases to bring prices up further. Then trend followers and scalp traders notice the upward momentum and buy shares too. This process loops as algos, PRT users, and trend followers continue to push prices higher by continuing to buy shares, outweighing any sells on AMD. Throw in some FOMO and index fund rebalancing we have a recipe for a 10% increase one week.

233,2019-11-05,"Infinite leverage

Robinhood Markets Inc. is a discount brokerage that allows customers to trade stocks and options, with zero commissions, on their phones. We have talked about Robinhood in the past when we discussed brokerage-y topics like zero commissions and payment for order flow.

But you can also analyze Robinhood as a mobile gaming company. It makes an app that you can download to your phone, and then you can play a game on the app. As with many mobile games, there are in-app purchases, and you can end up spending a lot of money on the Robinhood game. The game is of course a stock-trading game. The purchases are stocks. You win by getting a lot of money. But there are other ways to play. Some people aren’t interested in playing the game as its designers intended. They want to hack the game, to find weird glitches and exploits, to take the game apart and build their own weird levels, to stream the resulting monstrosities to entertain their friends.

Many, many, many of my readers have emailed and tweeted about a Robinhood exploit that goes by the charming and accurate name “infinite leverage.” Here’s a Reddit user called ControlTheNarrative who claims to have gotten 25x leverage on his trading; that is, he put in $2,000 and turned it into about $50,000 worth of stock. Here’s another Reddit user called MoonYachts who claims to have gotten 250x leverage, putting in $4,000 and turning it into a $1,000,000 stock position. You are not supposed to be able to do this; normal stock market games do not allow you to bet a million dollars by putting up only $4,000 of your own. (“We’re aware of the isolated situations and communicating directly with customers,” said a Robinhood spokesperson.)

These people are posting screenshots and videos of their exploits. They are discussing ways to use the exploit for further, even more outrageous pranks. I do not exactly know what they are thinking. Presumably some part of what they are thinking is along the lines of “if I use $4,000 to buy a million dollars’ worth of stock and it goes up then I will make a lot of money.” But surely another big part of what they are thinking is “if I use $4,000 to buy a million dollars’ worth of stock then my friends on Reddit will be amused.” Judging by the Reddit threads, and by my email inbox, this was a correct analysis. I suppose it is not a conventional financial analysis, but you should not underestimate the importance, in trading generally, of impressing people with your wit and boldness. For what do we live, but to make sport for r/wallstreetbets, and laugh at it in our turn?

Okay what is the trade? It might make more sense if I describe it in three ways. Version 1 is the simple economic description of the trade, which is easy to follow and, therefore, self-evidently ridiculous:

Put $100 in your margin account.
Buy $200 worth of stock on margin. (Brokers will generally lend you up to 50% of the value of the stock, so you can use your $100 to buy $200 of stock.)
Sell the stock for $200 of cash.
Use the $200 of cash to buy $400 of stock on margin.
Sell that stock for $400 of cash.
Use the $400 to buy $800 of stock on margin.
Etc.
That, to be clear, is not a thing. Your broker would notice, in step 3, that you sold the stock. It would probably ask you to repay the margin loan at that point. At the very least, it would notice that you still only had $100 of equity, and it wouldn’t lend you more money on margin.

But there is a variant on the trade that is economically more or less identical but that disguises what’s going on a bit. Here is Version 2 in schematic form[1]:

Put $100 into your margin account.
Buy $200 worth of stock on margin.
Sell deep-in-the-money covered call options on the stock for, say, $190. Simplistically, this means that someone pays you $190 today and in exchange you promise to sell them the $200 worth of stock for $10 at some specified date in the near future. You’ve sold $200 worth of stock for $200, but on a sort of installment plan where you get $190 now and $10 later.[2]
Now you don’t really own the stock anymore. Soon the options will be exercised, and you will deliver the shares. The option buyer really owns the stock; you’re just holding on to it for her for a little while.
But you still technically own the stock; the options haven’t been exercised yet.
And now you have $190 in cash to go along with the stock that you still technically own.
Use the cash to buy another $380 worth of stock on margin
Sell deep-in-the-money covered calls on that stock for, say, $361.
Now you have another $361 in cash.
Use that to buy another $722 worth of stock on margin.
Etc.
This is exactly as silly as the first version of the trade, but it is more confusing. “Sell deep-in-the-money covered calls on the stock” means almost the same thing as “sell the stock,” but it doesn’t sound the same. It has more words, and those words sound technical and options-y. And whereas selling the stock leaves you with no position (you had stock, you sold it, you have nothing), selling the option leaves you with two positions (you own stock and have sold options). Perhaps the computer software will not know how to combine those two positions. It should know how to combine them—this is pretty basic stuff, and you don’t really have any more equity in your account after selling a covered call than you do after selling the stock—but it might not. It definitely would not let you get away with Version 1, but it might let you get away with Version 2. 

It did! Here’s Version 3, which is quoted from ControlTheNarrative’s description on Reddit:

With Robinhood Gold, you can use what's called Margin to trade with increased Buying Power. So I did an instant deposit of 2000 dollars (the minimum required to access Gold Trading), and then I bought 100 shares of AMD for 3,800 or so, with margin. Then I sold an AMD Call Contract with a 2 dollar price strike to get almost all my money back (it's important to find a stock that has Call Options with such low strike prices like Ford, GE, etc). Then I use that money to buy TWO hundred shares of AMD because remember, margin doubles my buying power, then I sell 2 Call Contracts with the same 2 dollar strike price to get almost all my money back, which is then doubled again thanks to Robinhood's Margin. I repeat this until I am sufficiently leveraged for my Personal Risk Tolerance. Right now, I am at 25x leverage because I had 2000 dollars in Instant Deposits. 

Ah. Super. If you are reading this I hope I do not need to tell you that this is not investing advice. First of all it really shouldn’t be allowed; you shouldn’t be able to get infinite leverage this way, and I assume that Robinhood will close this loophole quickly. Second, even if you can do this, it’s not … it’s not like it’s free money or anything. You get more leverage than you ought to, but why would you want infinite leverage? Leverage isn’t an absolute good; it increases your potential return but also your risk. You probably shouldn’t make hugely levered single-stock bets with your savings! I don’t know, maybe it’s fun for you. Certainly it’s not investing.

I write sometimes around here about weird derivatives and financial perpetual-motion machines, trades that exploit glitches in markets or regulation to produce economically strange results. This is not exactly that. This is not a glitch in the world, or in regulation, or in the structure of markets, that will take years of work and complex legislation to fix; it doesn’t really demonstrate anything interesting or fundamental about the financial system. This is a glitch in one particular piece of software that can probably be fixed today by patching the software. 

On the other hand, I mean, sure, this is the retail version of goofy financial engineering. ControlTheNarrative and friends would fit right in as investment-bank derivatives structurers or distressed credit-default-swap traders. The combination of attributes here—high risk tolerance, ethical flexibility, fanatical literalism, a sense of joy and play and pride in their creativity—is easily recognizable. This trade doesn’t tell you anything fundamental about the financial system, but the attitude behind it might. So much of what is interesting and important in finance really is, deep down, about finding ways to hack the game.",xnate15,wallstreetbets,233.0

This is literally gambling with extra steps. You'll have a much better time learning to play Poker. Bunch of Indian Casinos are 18+. The buy in to even have a good time playing options is at least 10x what you have saved up. You can afford at most two decent plays.

I remember being 18 and having no money. The idea of getting ""rich"" quick was very appealing but if it was so easy, everyone would be driving lambos. You are way better off going to the personalfinance sub which actually has good advice for someone in your current situation. All you have to do is start a vanguard account and just dump as much money as you can in some growth fund. Stonks literally only go up over time which you have a lot of. If you're feeling nuts just make your own memestock portfolio with TSLA MSFT DIS AMD AAPL. A few hundred bucks into those stocks a month. By the time you graduate you'll likely be able to pay off your student loans in one go.

I wouldn't take that end of the trade too. But if you priced the call somewhere around $1.05 for $39, someone will take it. You can also price a call at $15 for $26, but doing this would slow down your process of doubling your margin during each trade cycle. 


&gt;I think the only opportunity for this to profit is if the underlying security gets juuuust down to the strike price. If that happens, the calls won't be exercised. That means he properly owns quite a bit of stock, and can then sell it for a little bit of extra profit.


Why does the share going just down to the strike price matter? It being called away for the strike price vs. selling it for a little under the strike price gives him about the same amount of capital back. It would actually be better for the stock to remain at or above the strike price because in that case he can collect the full strike from the contract instead of selling it for under that if the options expire worthless. 


The point of doing this isn't about turning a profit from selling the options for a premium, it's about minimizing the risk of losing your capital from each ""ponzi scheme"" margin cycle that you pull so that when its time to pay robinhood back (lol) for your ill-gotten margin, you still retain all of your bottom line.

It only really works well if there's a strong resistance or support that you can predict regularly it will bounce off of, if you have that reliable then you can estimate the low point on the put as it uptrends towards that resistance and lowball your bid to get it for the brief moment it touches, same for the support on calls  


This works great with meme stocks that are facing strong resistance (like AMD) until it doesn't. Friday last week I saw lots of sell orders and strong resistance at 35 so I kept scalping pennies on puts whenever it spiked to 34.9x and sold when it dropped down to 34.8x range for easy 3-4c gains

Dude deposited $2000. Got margin by using the automatic approval process, which gave him another $2000.

He then bought a financial contract that said that he would sell a $30 share of AMD for $2, and was paid $28 for accepting the contract.

As soon as he got that $28, he used that cash to apply for more margin, turning that $28 in ""new"" money into a total of $56, per share.

The financial contract he entered into is called a put, and it works on 100 shares at a time per contract, so instead of making $28, he made $2800, which was then doubled to $5600.

You repeat this a few times, and you're doubling your margin literally every time. After 8 doublings, you've got over 1 million dollars in leverage.

169,2019-11-06,"Uh you do not want to bet like this. This is illegal and the guy is risking 1.7mil that isn't his on a particularly risky bet.

Basically robinhood has a glitch in the way they calculate margin that for whatever reason they still have not patched many days after it was discovered.

The longer explanation... This guy abused that glitch by putting $3000 of his own money + the $3000 margin he actually should have access to towards buying 100 shares of AMD. He then wrote covered calls (calls are a type of options contract; in this case he is basically promising 100 shares of AMD to someone in the future in exchange for a smaller payment today). He then took the money from the call to buy more shares of AMD, which he then wrote more calls on, rinse and repeat until he had $1.7mil worth of AMD shares. The final trade he made is what's important - he bought 22000 shares of AMD and only wrote contracts on 2000 of them, effectively giving him 20,000 shares of AMD that he can actually profit from.

The problem is, because this is a glitch and goes against various laws/regulations (not to mention the contract he signed when he signed up for a margin account in the first place), he has no right to any profits, and could be liable for any losses.

All of the trades up until the last one are basically a wash out due to this;

Buy 100 shares for $3,529
Sell 100 shares for $3,314 + $200 = $3514
Net: -$15

Buy 200 shares for $7,003.64
$6,600 + $400 = $7,000
Net: -$3.63

....

Buy 12,000 shares for $420,183.60
Sell 12,000 shares for $396,600 + $24,000 = $420,600
Net: $416.40

Last Trade:

Buy 22,000 shares of AMD @ 34.98 for $769,553.40

But then either the market for $2 calls in AMD dried up, or OP decided they wanted to ride or die, because they only sold $65,800 worth of AMD calls.

This means they are left with a very significant (~$700k) long exposure to AMD at $34.98.

All the trades which are covered by the covered calls have effectively zero risk, at worst case $1 a share, but AMD would have to go to literally $0.

The final trade as long as it’s outstanding holds all the risk, but those shares can be straight up sold in a moments notice to basically close it all down and lock in gains. AMD currently at $36.09. So OP is currently up about $20k.",zaroth1,wallstreetbets,192.0

TL:DR

&gt;With Robinhood Gold, you can use what's called Margin to trade with increased Buying Power. So I did an instant deposit of 2000 dollars (the minimum required to access Gold Trading), and then I bought 100 shares of AMD for 3,800 or so, with margin. Then I sold an AMD Call Contract with a 2 dollar price strike to get almost all my money back (it's important to find a stock that has Call Options with such low strike prices like Ford, GE, etc). Then I use that money to buy TWO hundred shares of AMD because remember, margin doubles my buying power, then I sell 2 Call Contracts witht he same 2 dollar strike price to get almost all my money back, which is then doubled again thanks to Robinhood's Margin. I repeat this until I am sufficiently leveraged for my Personal Risk Tolerance. Right now, I am at 25x leverage because I had 2000 dollars in Instant Deposits. I then use my increased buying power to maximize my gains.

&gt;Basically Robinhood gave a skilled risk manager a 250 for 1 ratio loan so he can stomp their automated algorithm into the floor and lose it all with 16 hours or so. He purchased shares of stock and then sold calls against it deep in the money at a loss of about $2 per 100 shares. What this did was return the vast majority of his buying power back into his account. So basically he was allowed to keep the shares while also retaining his full buying power. This led to a theory. What if he could do this dozens of times. And oh he did. And blew up his account when he failed to anticipate the direction of Apple. &gt;This statement is for educational purposes only. Do not do this. It is meant as a warning&lt;

&gt;Mr. Pessimist gets a quote on the January $610 call on GOOG and sees the price at bid $5.00 and ask $5.10. He places an order to SELL 1 GOOG January $610 call as a market order. Mr. Bull also places a market order to BUY the very same GOOG option contract. Mr. Pessimist's order immediately gets filled at $5.00 so he receives $500 (remember each option contract covers 100 shares but is priced on a per share basis) in his account for selling the call option. Mr. Bull immediately gets filled at $5.10 and pays $510 for the GOOG January $610 call. The market maker gets the $10 spread.

Therefore, based on what i gathered:

Mr. Retard buys 100 shares of AMD at 35.29 for $3529. Does $2 call sell on these shares and gets $3314.

$2 is apparently the strike price? Or is it the premium?

Anyways somehow RH (Retard Haven) is giving him the value of the (stocks - premium)? And he uses that to market buy and rinse and repeat.

—————————-
&gt;A call option gives you the right to buy 100 shares of stock. A put option gives you the right to sell 100 shares of stock.

Buying call, you want it to go up so you can het higher valued stock at a lower price (eg $20 put costs $2 per share, stock goes to $50 so you profit 5000-2000-200 = 2800).

Buying put, you want it to go down so you can sell x shares that you don’t currently have (eg 2011 $40 put contract that costs $2 per share, goes down from $50 to $20 within time range so you profit 4000-2000-200 = 1800).

&gt;Call and put options simply change who has the ability to exercise the option. Call options give the buyer the choice to buy the commodity, whereas put options give the seller the power. Options differ from normal sales in that they do not occur immediately.

&gt;If the seller of the call owns the underlying stock, then it is called ""writing a covered call.""

&gt;It's January 1st and Mr. Pessimist owns 100 shares of GOOG stock that he bought 5 years ago at $100. The stock is now at $600 but Mr. Pessimist thinks that the price of GOOG is going to stay the same or drop in the next month, but he wants to continue to own the stock for the long term. At the same time, Mr. Bull just read an article on GOOG and thinks GOOG is going to go up $20 in the next few weeks because GOOG is about to have a press release saying they expect their China traffic to be very strong for the year.

&gt;Mr. Pessimist gets a quote on the January $610 call on GOOG and sees the price at bid $5.00 and ask $5.10. He places an order to SELL 1 GOOG January $610 call as a market order. Mr. Bull also places a market order to BUY the very same GOOG option contract. Mr. Pessimist's order immediately gets filled at $5.00 so he receives $500 (remember each option contract covers 100 shares but is priced on a per share basis) in his account for selling the call option. Mr. Bull immediately gets filled at $5.10 and pays $510 for the GOOG January $610 call. The market maker gets the $10 spread.

&gt;Once the trade is made, Mr. Pessimist hopes that GOOG stays below $610 until the third Friday in January. Meanwhile, Mr. Bull is hoping that GOOG closes well above $610 by the third Friday in January. If GOOG closes at $610 or below then the call option will expire worthless and Mr. Pessimist profits the $500 he received for writing / selling the call; and Mr. Bull loses his $510. If GOOG closes at $620, then Mr. Bull would exercise the call option and buy the 100 shares of GOOG from Mr. Pessimist at $610. Mr. Pessimist has now received $500 for writing the call option, but he has also lost $1000 because he had to sell a stock that was worth $620 for $610. Mr. Bull would be happy in that he spent $510, but he made $1000 on the stock because he ended up paying $610 for a stock that was worth $620.

So using all this can someone explain how RH is giving him money to reinvest and leverage to a stupid amount starting from a couple grand.

Even with all this I still don’t get how he’s getting the money to leverage himself more. I mainly don’t get how he arrived at $1.7 million covered calls.

Found in other threads:

if i read correctly you sold calls on top of a long position that you own. so if your options expire ITM you'll basically sell your position and pocket your gains + the options fee.

this is called a covered call position. it's used by people to generate income and/or magnify returns on a bullish position. It's a nice strategy, because the options fee you charged allows you to sell lower than you bought. this is a smart move for your case.

He sold deep ITM options. If he's holding $1.7m of $AMD covered calls and $AMD goes up $1, his shares increase in value by $1 BUT his shares will still be called away at the strike price he originally sold calls at. And if he tries to buy back those contracts, they will have gone up in value by $1. Net $0 either way.

I think you can use this glitch to continually increase your margin cash but at some point you need to ""cash out"" into something other than deep ITM covered calls, otherwise basically nothing happens.",slimuser98,wallstreetbets,240.0

271,2019-11-06,"Oh, didn't realize they were extremely deep ITM ($2 strike vs ~36$ underlying). 

Well, it has two sides, if they share price goes under the strike price he earns the full premium (which, mind you, is extremely high because the calls ar sold ITM) because no one is going to exercise an OTM call. But then again, is the call buyer sees a steady drop in value such that AMD is going to drop from $36 to under your strike price $2 (!!!) you bet your ass he is gonna exercise before that happens (or just really likes risk). On the other side, if the share price drops you lose on your long position as well. 

Now how does this change the payoff? Say the premium on a $2 strike on 36$ underlying is $35 (never lower than $36-$2=$34 if you ever find this, buy and exercise immediately, it's literally free money!). 

If the share price goes up from $36 to $50 your payoff is $14 long and -/-$48 short = -/-$34, but your premium was at least $34 so total profit is at least $0, in our example with 35$ premium profit is 1$.

For share price = $1000: $964-$998=-/-$34 + premium $35 = $1 profit. So our profits if the share price goes up or stays flat is capped at $1.

Now what if the share price goes down? Again, you went long on $36, sold calls with strike $2 and a $35 premium. 
Say the share price drops to $35, you have these payoffs: long stock -/-$1, short call -/-$33, total -/-$34, BUT again, you have a premium of $35, netting you $1 in profit. 

Say it goes down deep, $3: long stock -/-$33, short call -/-$1 total -/-$34, again, premium of $35 = $1 profit. 

Say AMD goed bankrupt and all shares are worthless:
Long stock -/-$36, short call $0 (if share price is lower than strike price a call isn't exercised, so it's payoff capped at $0), premium =$35, so net LOSS of $1. 

So what does this tell us? If the share price is between $0-$1 call seller loses up to 1 dollar. If the share price goes anywhere above $1 call seller gains up to $1, regardless of underlying asset price.

So this was extremely simplified, and assuming that the market is liquid enough, and keep in mind that I've priced the option premium at $35 for simplification, which isn't the reality. In reality, you would probably not even make cents profit instead of 1 dollar, because the risk that AMD goes from $36 to $2 is extremely small (but still there!).

Infinite leverage

Robinhood Markets Inc. is a discount brokerage that allows customers to trade stocks and options, with zero commissions, on their phones. We have talked about Robinhood in the past when we discussed brokerage-y topics like zero commissions and payment for order flow.

But you can also analyze Robinhood as a mobile gaming company. It makes an app that you can download to your phone, and then you can play a game on the app. As with many mobile games, there are in-app purchases, and you can end up spending a lot of money on the Robinhood game. The game is of course a stock-trading game. The purchases are stocks. You win by getting a lot of money. But there are other ways to play. Some people aren’t interested in playing the game as its designers intended. They want to hack the game, to find weird glitches and exploits, to take the game apart and build their own weird levels, to stream the resulting monstrosities to entertain their friends.

Many, many, many of my readers have emailed and tweeted about a Robinhood exploit that goes by the charming and accurate name “infinite leverage.” Here’s a Reddit user called ControlTheNarrative who claims to have gotten 25x leverage on his trading; that is, he put in $2,000 and turned it into about $50,000 worth of stock. Here’s another Reddit user called MoonYachts who claims to have gotten 250x leverage, putting in $4,000 and turning it into a $1,000,000 stock position. You are not supposed to be able to do this; normal stock market games do not allow you to bet a million dollars by putting up only $4,000 of your own. (“We’re aware of the isolated situations and communicating directly with customers,” said a Robinhood spokesperson.)

These people are posting screenshots and videos of their exploits. They are discussing ways to use the exploit for further, even more outrageous pranks. I do not exactly know what they are thinking. Presumably some part of what they are thinking is along the lines of “if I use $4,000 to buy a million dollars’ worth of stock and it goes up then I will make a lot of money.” But surely another big part of what they are thinking is “if I use $4,000 to buy a million dollars’ worth of stock then my friends on Reddit will be amused.” Judging by the Reddit threads, and by my email inbox, this was a correct analysis. I suppose it is not a conventional financial analysis, but you should not underestimate the importance, in trading generally, of impressing people with your wit and boldness. For what do we live, but to make sport for r/wallstreetbets, and laugh at it in our turn?

Okay what is the trade? It might make more sense if I describe it in three ways. Version 1 is the simple economic description of the trade, which is easy to follow and, therefore, self-evidently ridiculous:

Put $100 in your margin account.

Buy $200 worth of stock on margin. (Brokers will generally lend you up to 50% of the value of the stock, so you can use your $100 to buy $200 of stock.)

Sell the stock for $200 of cash.

Use the $200 of cash to buy $400 of stock on margin.

Sell that stock for $400 of cash.

Use the $400 to buy $800 of stock on margin.

Etc.

That, to be clear, is not a thing. Your broker would notice, in step 3, that you sold the stock. It would probably ask you to repay the margin loan at that point. At the very least, it would notice that you still only had $100 of equity, and it wouldn’t lend you more money on margin.

But there is a variant on the trade that is economically more or less identical but that disguises what’s going on a bit. Here is Version 2 in schematic form[1]:

Put $100 into your margin account.

Buy $200 worth of stock on margin.

Sell deep-in-the-money covered call options on the stock for, say, $190. Simplistically, this means that someone pays you $190 today and in exchange you promise to sell them the $200 worth of stock for $10 at some specified date in the near future. You’ve sold $200 worth of stock for $200, but on a sort of installment plan where you get $190 now and $10 later.[2]

Now you don’t really own the stock anymore. Soon the options will be exercised, and you will deliver the shares. The option buyer really owns the stock; you’re just holding on to it for her for a little while.

But you still technically own the stock; the options haven’t been exercised yet.

And now you have $190 in cash to go along with the stock that you still technically own.

Use the cash to buy another $380 worth of stock on margin

Sell deep-in-the-money covered calls on that stock for, say, $361.

Now you have another $361 in cash.

Use that to buy another $722 worth of stock on margin.

Etc.

This is exactly as silly as the first version of the trade, but it is more confusing. “Sell deep-in-the-money covered calls on the stock” means almost the same thing as “sell the stock,” but it doesn’t sound the same. It has more words, and those words sound technical and options-y. And whereas selling the stock leaves you with no position (you had stock, you sold it, you have nothing), selling the option leaves you with two positions (you own stock and have sold options). Perhaps the computer software will not know how to combine those two positions. It should know how to combine them—this is pretty basic stuff, and you don’t really have any more equity in your account after selling a covered call than you do after selling the stock—but it might not. It definitely would not let you get away with Version 1, but it might let you get away with Version 2. 

It did! Here’s Version 3, which is quoted from ControlTheNarrative’s description on Reddit:

With Robinhood Gold, you can use what's called Margin to trade with increased Buying Power. So I did an instant deposit of 2000 dollars (the minimum required to access Gold Trading), and then I bought 100 shares of AMD for 3,800 or so, with margin. Then I sold an AMD Call Contract with a 2 dollar price strike to get almost all my money back (it's important to find a stock that has Call Options with such low strike prices like Ford, GE, etc). Then I use that money to buy TWO hundred shares of AMD because remember, margin doubles my buying power, then I sell 2 Call Contracts with the same 2 dollar strike price to get almost all my money back, which is then doubled again thanks to Robinhood's Margin. I repeat this until I am sufficiently leveraged for my Personal Risk Tolerance. Right now, I am at 25x leverage because I had 2000 dollars in Instant Deposits. 

Ah. Super. If you are reading this I hope I do not need to tell you that this is not investing advice. First of all it really shouldn’t be allowed; you shouldn’t be able to get infinite leverage this way, and I assume that Robinhood will close this loophole quickly. Second, even if you can do this, it’s not … it’s not like it’s free money or anything. You get more leverage than you ought to, but why would you want infinite leverage? Leverage isn’t an absolute good; it increases your potential return but also your risk. You probably shouldn’t make hugely levered single-stock bets with your savings! I don’t know, maybe it’s fun for you. Certainly it’s not investing.

I write sometimes around here about weird derivatives and financial perpetual-motion machines, trades that exploit glitches in markets or regulation to produce economically strange results. This is not exactly that. This is not a glitch in the world, or in regulation, or in the structure of markets, that will take years of work and complex legislation to fix; it doesn’t really demonstrate anything interesting or fundamental about the financial system. This is a glitch in one particular piece of software that can probably be fixed today by patching the software. 

On the other hand, I mean, sure, this is the retail version of goofy financial engineering. ControlTheNarrative and friends would fit right in as investment-bank derivatives structurers or distressed credit-default-swap traders. The combination of attributes here—high risk tolerance, ethical flexibility, fanatical literalism, a sense of joy and play and pride in their creativity—is easily recognizable. This trade doesn’t tell you anything fundamental about the financial system, but the attitude behind it might. So much of what is interesting and important in finance really is, deep down, about finding ways to hack the game.",ShorttheEntre,wallstreetbets,289.0

1 Testing by AMD performance labs on  10/07/2019  comparing an AMD Ryzen™ Threadripper™ 3970X and  Intel © Core™ i9-9980XE in the Cinebench R20 nT benchmark test. Results may vary. CPK-01
2 Specifications of 3rd generation Ryzen Threadripper processors as of  October 29th, 2019 . As of  October 8, 2019 , the AMD 3rd Gen Ryzen Threadripper processors can deliver 133GB/s of concurrent device bandwidth.  Intel's  competing high-end desktop processor, the Core i9-10980XE, can deliver up to 52GB/s of concurrent device bandwidth. 52/133=2.55 times the bandwidth on 3rd gen AMD Threadripper. The desktop platform that previously offered the most bandwidth on desktop was the 2nd Gen Ryzen Threadripper processor, which could deliver up to 128 GB/s of bandwidth. CPK-14

6 Performance per watt testing conducted by AMD performance labs as of 10/18/2019. Relative performance per watt evaluated by dividing Cinebench R20 nT score by total system power. Watts per core approximated by dividing system wall power by core count(s). Products tested: AMD Ryzen™ Threadripper™ 3960X, AMD Ryzen™ Threadripper™ 3970X, Intel Core i9-9980XE. Results may vary. CPK-03
7 Max boost for AMD Ryzen PRO Processors is the maximum frequency achievable by a single core on the processor running a bursty single-threaded workload. Max boost will vary based on several factors, including, but not limited to: thermal paste; system cooling; motherboard design and BIOS; the latest AMD chipset driver; and the latest OS updates. GD-150
8 Though both are often measured in watts, it is important to distinguish between thermal and electrical watts. Thermal wattage for processors is conveyed via thermal design power (TDP). TDP is a calculated value that conveys an appropriate thermal solution to achieve the intended operation of a processor. Electrical watts are not a variable in the TDP calculation. By design, electrical watts can vary from workload to workload and may exceed thermal watts. GD-109

4,2019-11-10,"So. I've been trading options for about 10 years now.. Given the trades you posted I think there is some issues I can help with. 

1. Risk management - I don't know how big your account is but given the trades you posted it seems like your oversizing your positions and swinging for the fences. I have a 100k trading account and I run 2k position sizes. That's 2% per trade and I generally have 12-16 trades on. If a trade goes against me I generally recover 50% so 1% max loss per trade. I've done the oversizing thing. It never ends well. If you have a 5k account.. obviously 2% inst gonna get you much but 10% could.. $500 is doable per position. I started with 4k. 
2. I don't trade earnings. Its a losing game. You don't know what its gonna do and IV will kill options. I've learned this over years of pain. Maybe 2 out of 10 earnings trades work out IMHO. 
3. You need to get on the right side of the market.. What hot right now is not V, AMD, MC, NVDA. It value plays, oil, semis, Util/Reit shorts, Software shorts and china. I have Dec calls in MCHP, WLL, PYPL, CLF, AKS, MRO, X, BIDU, CRC, BABA, DLPH, and a SO short. The market is rotating under your feet. You need to recognize by watching the what is getting bought every day. Top 100 winners and losers will tell you when shifts occur. No way I would take a trade in NKE.. Bad entry, Bad risk/reward. You cant buy Z after the earnings pop. Its a good idea but all those earnings buyers are gonna get trapped. I wouldn't enter till 34.50. If I don't get that price I'd move on, always another trade.  AMD is begging for a pullback. You gotta buy low.. you are SO late to the AMD party, you will lose money.",Malice4you2,wallstreetbets,4.0
5,2019-11-09,"And everyone wants the 500% gain. A trend I see with a lot of earnings too is that whether they beat or miss, whether the stock goes up after ER or down after ER, more than likely the stock likes to move in the opposite direction or return to base a week or two after, which is why if you pair monthlies and itm options together, you can hold and profit from that post ER move.

Intel has good CPUs and no decent GPUs but the Xe may change that... Maybe.

The only issue I have with nVidia is that they don't have an x86 CPU yet which could put them at a disadvantage if Intel's Xe GPU ever becomes competitive. nVidia is doing some nice work with ARM-based SOCs and there are some x86 patents expiring soon so things may get interesting.",Draiko,wallstreetbets,9.0

Earlier this year, I was going to buy Qualcomm before they settled with Apple but they settled about a month earlier than I expected and I missed the wave. I'm pretty sure Apple is going to dump Qualcomm once they have their own softmodems up and running. Samsung may do the same. Qualcomm is going to dip again at some point. I don't want to time those events because that dip could be a big one.

I'm keeping a close eye on Intel in case their upcoming Xe GPU is any good and/or Mobileye does anything amazing.

20,2019-11-11,"Ok the best way to look at buying vs selling is this, especially with options:

When you buy a call, the stock price needs to go up and continue up quickly and not stop or have any flat or pullback days or else your call loses value quickly. 

This is why day trading or weekly options can be lucrative except when the algos and computers just push the price around to take free money from kids playing with options..

When you sell a put, you only care about the strike price you sold at. You want the stock to be above the strike price you sold on the day of expiration and into that night after close.

So if you sell a $248 apple put, then apple needs to stay above $248 on the day that option expires. 

When you sell a call you can get assigned but remember that most of the time you either want to be assigned or you are getting the stock at a lower price so it would be a good thing.

You also need to know you can also sell put spreads which will mean you won't even get assigned the shares you will just cancel put at a small loss and exercise both the sold put and the bought put.

Ask if you need this explained more.

If you want apple at $242 by next week, then sell $242 apple puts expiring this friday.

And if apple doesn't hit $242 by this Friday, you just keep free money that you get when you sell the put. That's the ""premium"" you read about here.


So, the difference between buying a call and selling a put is buying lets you make way more money quicker but absolutely relies on good news and hype of the stock to rise very fast and then stay at the new higher price without falling back at all.

And selling a put only requires the stock price to stay above the strike price you sold ON the DAY of Expiration.

Make sure you understand it's ok for the stock price to go below your strike during some of the time you sell a put. You just only want the price of the stock to be above your strike if you are letting it expire worthless to collect all the premium.

Remember if you sell a put, you also may actually want the shares at a lower price, so you should be selling puts all the time if you want shares at lower prices..

Take AMD for example, you may not like the big and asks but let's say you want shares of AMD at $27, well try to sell strike $27 puts or put spreads that expire this friday.

That way if AMD doesn't hit under $27 by this Friday, you collect like $50 or less for doing that or, if AMD does go to $26.99 or lower by this Friday, you will get assigned the shares and then own AMD at $27/share!

So I want you to realize as much as you'll get comments trying to scare you out of selling puts, realize the facts that selling puts is a major component of what we should be doing here while yoloing calls on top of them.


Imagine buying calls on apple or weed, and then sellikg tons of put spreads underneath, that way you can make the price of the calls less since you will be getting premium for selling puts and you will be essentially taking a bet that the stock will go up and when your calls lose value because of the way options work (like I said the stock price has to rise up fast and stay up) you will be still ok because you sold puts which are making you money while the stock stays flat or even pulls back, as long as the price doesn't go below the strike of the put you sold on the DAY of EXPIRATION.

Make sure you understand that if someone exercises your put before the expiration and the price is above the strike you sold, they are literally forcing you to make money!

I can tell you more later.",jarjarbinks3e,wallstreetbets,20.0

32,2019-11-10,"&gt; Trading is about timing.

You can't really time the market, at least I know I can't.

&gt; You had no idea what AMD was designing or if it was gonna work

We did know they were working on Zen in 2016. And we knew AMD was betting the company on it. There is a youtube video with Mark Pappermaster and Jim Keller, in which they talk about scrapping all the CPU design teams and creating a  new team, with focus on early tooling and simulations to help them hit the design goals from the get go. In 2016 we've known that they have worked on the Zen core for 4 years already and that at the end of 2016 we were going to see the result of that work.

&gt; Personal traders and day traders don’t buy and hold forever like that, it ties up capital and leaves your risk wide open. 

They keep posting stats which show that day traders and personal traders often get beat by simple total market index funds on average.

Investing in AMD in 2016 and holding until now is akin to value investing. Basically the same stuff that made Warren Buffet rich.

I was going to sell by now, but at this point, I think AMD actually has a chance of staying ahead of Intel for quite some time.

In 2016 when I bought AMD, the stock wasn't even part of the S&amp;P500. It's AMD's performance that propelled it to that level. Now granted, I do agree that rising tide lifts all boats, and probably a good portion of AMD's gains comes from general bullish market we've been having since 2010 (in no small part due to low Fed rates). But AMD has been an outlier. It's one of the best performing stocks on the market by quite a margin. 

This isn't related to some macro anomaly. This is the direct result of AMD actually having competitive products and the position they are in as a result of their own performance.

It is very simple indeed, AMD currently has the world's best server CPU. Let that sink in.

They have an architectural lead and a process fab lead (thanks to TSMC and the decade of smartphone proliferation). Both leads which took years to establish, and both leads which could take years to lose. Quite simply AMD is in the driving seat as a result of making the right bets with their technology.

Now consider this. AMD has less than 10% marketshare in the most lucrative of its markets (the Server market). This makes their position such that the only way for them to go is up. Regardless of the macro conditions.",noiserr,wallstreetbets,17.0

19,2019-11-11,"so the point of playing options around earnings is the occasional 10 bagger you make. it's not a consistent play. a bunch of shit has to go right, like it did with $AMD in Q3 this year. 

So you start watching close around 1 month before earnings, when you are anticipating a big move based on market research you've been doing since the start of the previous quarter...

Then you wait for *the smallest little dip* and buy, say, 10 contracts OTM, but within reach. I usually track these options prices for about a week before making the first buy (unless shit starts getting crazy, then I'm fuck-it-YOLOing whatever contracts are in the \~$1.00 range). Exp dates are tough, but try to not be retarded and do some math. If you're trying to make 1600% gains, you can't buy leaps, sorry. 

As you creep closer to earnings, depends on how big ur balls are, buy more slightly OTM contracts in say batches of 5. 

Never forget: you can sell any time, but you want to sell the day before earnings, bc that's when all the FOMO-affected retards buy in. When they buy, you sell.

5,2019-11-13,the xavier chips those are the ones for autonomous cars correct? I dont know to much for those however tesla is no longer going to be using nvidias chips in their cars. they are making there own and seeing huge success. This is a big problem if nvidia prices themselves out of their own market where other companies rather make their own chips and seeing good results isnt a good sign. The xavier chips have not seen good enough adoption to carry faltering sales from their core business. The gpus in data center are fine especially if they take advantage of the tensor cores in the new gpus. However they simply price too high amd alot of the time bundels free gpus with epic sever cpus. Nvidia cant compete because there cpus are lacking. Besides gpus nvidia is worse at everything. With gpus nvidia is charging an arm and a leg because until recently amds gpus were not good efficient enough in severs and they had a bad rep in the pc industry. With those both being gone now nvidia has to lower prices because amd will undercut them. Nvidia sits with profit margins in the over 200% range amd has stated they are more than happy enough to lower margies all the way down to 45 %. As long as amds options arnt too far behind data centers look at them first. And more on the cpu front. Arm chips made by other compaines are currently much better than nvidias from what i have seen. Tldr nvidia is over pricing them selves out of the market and competitors are catching up because they can just sell there stuff cheaper or make it themselves cheaper. let me know if u got more questions,DragonMaster9595,wallstreetbets,5.0

7,2019-11-13,"Nvidias stock is over rated currently. As someone who is entrenched in pc hardware technologies and the companies around it i can say that they are essentially puffing up their chest to make the value go up. They moved substantially less units this year because the 2000 series gpus was so expensive. The margins were great and investors love that and all but a lot of you don't realize is the bigger problem. The super refreshes were just re pumping out the same cards the 2070s is a cut down 2080 2060 s is a 2070 and so on. They use these ""new"" cards in order to get increased publicity in order to be able to drive more sales. Most of their sales currently come from gamers and they have reached essentially market cap. Almost everyone who will buy from nvidia has. And their attempts of going into other sectors isn't panning out. AMDs gpus are catching up really quick. Because nvidias prices are so high its easy for amd to make gpus at a lower cost and under cut at every price point. Amds gpus are pretty good this time around and are seeing great adoption imagine what happens when more than 2 cards will release? With amds ryzen cpus they make combo deals with companies that include gpus cutting nvidia out. Nvidia has currently peaked. Their real new gpus are not planned for at least until march. The 11/15 ur calling is probably the 1650 super since we know that planned to launch.",DragonMaster9595,wallstreetbets,7.0

27,2019-12-02,"I let my puts ride, I think we get a bit more selling. 


Going to start stepping into mid Jan and Feb AMD calls. If you want long dated calls or shares of AMD now or any time before CES would be a fine time to build up. It is not going to double again this year, but i could see anywhere from 50 to 60s by next Jan depending on how their mobile and next EYPC chip stack up. I think the big wildcard is the mobile. They will have the console revenue this year as well. An EPS of 1.5 isn't unreasonable for full year 2020  and a 40 multiple gets you $60 a share, 30 multiple gets you 45. That being said who knows how the market will react of we have a major correction. 


TSM earnings are Dec 15. I like long calls or shares on TSM for the next year or 2 till Intel or Samsung figure their shit out. They have 5nm on the way and have industry leaders from every field as customers. They are booked to capacity and are spending billions to produce more and on R n D to stay ahead.

The beauty of options is you can buy premiums on stocks you could not afford with a 1000 trading account. Your question only makes sense for a stock portfolio. I suggest you look into options alpha or investopedia for further research. That being said there are cheap stocks with high volatility, amd and snap are popular ones for intraday trading. You can buy a SPY contract for a dollar or for 1000 dollars depending on your strike price and expiration. Anything goes, and it's all about your goals, and what you expect the market to do.

85,2019-12-03,"AMD has the potential to go to $80 a share by 2025, that’s for certain. Their engineering approach is fascinating. They need to capture more of the server market from Intel to be a real threat to their dominance, but for consumer hardware, their APUs offer a nice, simple package for game consoles, and any workstation with a Threadripper at its heart is a force to be reckoned with. 

I’m a PC nut and build my own rigs, and my current rig is a Core i7-6950X with 128GB RAM, two Titan X Pascals, all SSD storage, a 1600W PSU, a Corsair 900D case, and a custom EKWB loop with two radiators. Put it together myself. Well, me and dad, actually. He helped with the tubing bending part, since he’s good with a heat gun, and I did all the component installation and the waterblocks and backplates. It has clear acrylic hard lines with red dyed coolant (Mayhems distilled water with EKWB dye). It runs like a bat out of hell, even two years later. 

I originally built it not just to be able to play Star Citizen, but also to run DAWs with big orchestral templates and stuff, since I compose as a hobby, lol. I was actually eyeing Threadripper for my next build, even though my last few have been Intels. I need that multi-core power for my projects. More cores = more raw calc power = less buffer overruns and latency in DAWs. Also, yes, the RAM is totally necessary. It’s easy to end up allocating 30 to 60 gigs for orchestral samples, and in fact, back in the day, composers often did cluster setups where they’d use something like Vienna Ensemble and have one rig running the DAW as a master rig, and a couple of slave rigs that would do nothing but sit there all day, powered on, with the samples already loaded into memory (the composer for Dead Space used a couple Power Macs and Pro Tools, IIRC). These days, you can do it all in one single monster workstation, and SSDs mean you can load your samples into RAM in mere minutes whereas before, it’d take all damn day. I swear by the Samsung SATA and M.2 SSDs. Very robust. I’ve had Corsair SSDs fail on me before.

I fiddle around with 3DS Max and Blender and video encoding stuff, but I’ve never particularly felt the need to get something like a Quadro. For my next rig, I was thinking about mounting the components inside my desk. Desk-integral rigs with glass tops that let you look down into the guts are the new hotness. Like, do a custom enclosure with a blower fan with its own HEPA filter, and water cooling lines that run out to external radiators, and stuff like that. It gets chilly where I am, so I’d set it up so that the radiators are behind the monitor and it blows hot air over me. It’s gonna be wild. When and if I get around to building it, I’ll have to document the process.",THASF,wallstreetbets,85.0

7,2019-12-05,"Yea, so one of my first times using condors to recover was during high IV environments, when either:

 1. VIX was higher earlier in the year OR 2. During Earnings Season

I would check the implied weekly move of the earnings stock, the average implied move of previous earnings (to see outliers as well), and the calculate the value of the move based on that percentage (so like 4% could be 7$ depending on the stock).

Example: Disney earnings implied move: 5% or 7$, I would sell OTM Condors around a 7-8%  or $10 move with a decent width (distance between short and long leg). They would be weeklies so I could immediately profit off the high IV the next day if the trade goes my way. I have always profited (7/8 this year) off this during earnings season except one time I got greedy with CSCO and moved it a little closer, but outside, the implied move. Managed to not lose a lot on that though. Some earnings stocks to look at: FB, DIS, SNAP (go a little bit extra otm on SNAP), AAPL, AMD

The trick is using stocks that don't have crazy outliers like Amazon could drop or rise $120 off earnings even if the implied move is 70$.",Big_Factz,wallstreetbets,7.0

1. They sold the mobile wing of the business (It had no future LOL) and then later rebuilt and failed at mobile processors multiple times and have no viable product here
2. Amazon and Google are going to or have started to build their own processors for specialized tasks for their cloud services for performance reasons that a  general processor like intel makes can't help.

It was Christmas break last year when the market was tanking and I was about to get a bonus. I was thinking about what stock I should lose this newfound money on. I'm at my desk and my cat is on this shelf that's above. Also on this shelf is a giant jar or pens and pencils.

So, I'm sitting there talking to my cat. Asking him if I should put it into Amazon or the Zuck or maybe Disney will blow up with its crazy 2019 movie line. He kinda looks at me like I'm retarded. Also, I think he just wanted to have a peaceful nap in the sun that is hitting him perfectly while on the shelf.

Then I mention AMD. His head perks up and with his front paw he knocks that jar of pens and pencils off the desk and directly onto the box I had for the new Ryzen processor I had recently bought. 

I was like ya, 2019 will be AMD's year. Intel is finally going to implode on itself and the institutions will finally get on board. So, I buy like $10K of stock at $19 on the cat's advice. Today it is $40 a more than 100% return. However, I am still retarded and didn't make 100% because I thought I could make more on poorly timed AMD options but still that cat was a wizard.

Earlier in the week I got 4k worth 95 strike TWLO calls and about 400AMD shares, but next day trump comes out with that trade comment that he can wait till after election, scared me out of my positions for a loss, next day TWLO goes to 99. Rotated into EA puts the next day and it stayed green while rest of market tanked, sold for loss. Today was okay I bought 312 1 week calls on SPY yesterday over 100% gain but I only spent 600 unfortunately. Sold my 5k worth of SPY 312 strike 4 weeks expry yesterday, unwilling to bet so much on jobs report, and moved some of that to DIS, but DIS barely moved today. Sold those calls for minor loss. Played a little on CRM earnings and lost, shoulda know it'd barely move. But biggest loss was that EA put with the DIS calls second highest loss. Down 1500 this week. All my SPY plays were gains.

Decided to not buy calls anymore. Be smarter about my trading. I'll just buy shares on margin and buy them by selling puts. There's really no reason for me to buy options because my margin account sma is so high from past margin use in 2018. With 12k account I can get about 50k margin. A 5% move in stocks I own would represent 20% account swing and its less dangerous than buying options. Plus can get premiums for selling options. If I diversify stock holdings then margin call shouldn't be an issue unless the market itself crashes. Today I started this plan and already got over $500 in premium for sold puts (TWLO 98, TTD 247.5, NET 17.5). I got assigned TTD (by $0.15) but that's okay. Plan to sell call on it Monday, and calls sell for a lot, near money is like $600. Stocks I bought were small posotions just to diversify. 10 ULTA, 10 TSLA, 100 AMD.

7,2019-12-08,"I’m mid 30s and also millionaire mostly from stock trading though I had great income for a few years. Found WSB around 2 years ago and my trading account went from 300k to right now about 1.5MM almost entirely on AMD.

Before AMD I made about 90% in a year on WNC and the year or two before that maybe 150% or more on GGP. At this point I don’t think I have anything but house money in my stock account since I’ve pulled a good bit out along the way.

Most of my trades have been my entire portfolio or near it and then I have a Roth that is slightly more balanced.

In my opinion, buying options in general is a good pretty good way to lose money over the long term though I did have a 10-bagger on ESI that I held for about 5 minutes of market time on ESI a few years back too. I don’t think this applies for spreads and other strategies because you’re selling/hedging. 

Leaps are different too. I very nearly bought 100k of $12 leaps when I was down 100k on AMD when it was at $9 (my in price is like $11.50) and had I done it they would have been worth 3.5MM so I guess they’re not always bad. Feels bad man.

Anyway, it can be done. Just steady gains in a 10 year bull market!",IKnowTheCodings,wallstreetbets,7.0

9,2019-12-08,"I was iffy on AMD after this rise but I think the trade scare news last week convinced me that AMD is pretty safe at these levels. I'm not saying it can't or won't drop, but if you look at AMD price history it rallies up then finds a new range that it sticks to until earnings, this used to be 29 to 32. After the rise to about 42 it became unclear what its new range is. It has dropped to as low as 38.5ish since then. I don't think 42 is the top end of its new range, we might not even see that again for awhile, but with trade scare it fell to about 38.5 so I don't think the bottom range is that much lower than that for AMD. With any trade news I would have expected a larger drop than that given how fast it rose without building support levels. New tariff increases will definitely make it go lower than 38.5, but probably no lower than mid 36s where it paused briefly on its rally. It has held strong at 39.5ish with some visits to 40+ but I wouldn't be ready to say 39.5 is support, it could end up being resistance of the new range. So conservatively, I think AMD is in a 36-39.5 range. If being less conservative, I would say 38.5-42, but I wouldn't bank on that.",Zer033x,wallstreetbets,9.0

AMD is currently unbeatable in chips and are poised to take marketshare from INTC. they broke 34ish resistance awhile back then built some bases on its ascent, mostly at 36.5, now at 39.5. I consider 36.5ish lowest it'll drop before next earnings.

35,2019-12-10,"To a certain degree the numbers are pretty accurate. I think the numbers on the website are calculated once per day and are not real time though, which is one reason why my numbers differ. The biggest factor on the difference in numbers is the model for calculating options price &amp; Greeks, ie, Multinomial, Black-Scholes, Bjerksund-Stendsland, or in house crafted models.  


The discrepancy between SPX and SPY is IMO, because options writers love SPX. It is cash settled and so has inherently less rick. Since market making options writers are not particularly interested in profiting from underlying shares it makes sense that they would be interested in writing on SPX over SPY.  


If you only had time to analyze the greeks of one of those tickers yes I would focus on SPX, but like everything in the market, the connection and analysis on SPY could also be helpful, as well as /ES and really any correlated index.  


Sometimes it is important to look closely at Gamma for individual stocks, especially if you are writing options for it. For example, AMD has a pretty steep Gamma drop-off as you pass the $40 mark. This has been a contributing factor to the very strong resistance found at the $40 price point for $AMD.  


Swing and Day traders can use Gamma exposure to add to their toolbox of useful items, however it is not a golden ticket as I'm sure you know. Brownian Walk models suggest that short term price movements are very random indeed, and knowing how brokers randomize big block orders via time sliced randomization in +/-55% order sizes, I can generally agree with this, however Gamma exposure in a given stock can show at what point resistance and support levels are more than merely coincidence. Suggesting where there may actually be strong supply and demand metrics at play.  


Gamma changes on a continuous basis because it is calculated using the total gamma of all outstanding options for whatever ticker you are looking at, so yes it not only changes daily, but constantly.  


Yes, when Gamma flips from negative to positive it may contribute to rising prices. A positive Gamma will support higher and higher price points generally until an event reverses it.  


I would say not to avoid or go into a trade solely on gamma exposure, however when nearing a flip zone or when GEX is pinched be wary of increased volatility in that ticker. That is ultimately what gamma exposure tells you, the probability of volatility picking up.",chaney3,wallstreetbets,35.0

12,2019-12-12,"Sure, looking at it now, he didn't do a normal call spread because the calls he sold will expire before the calls he bought. Essentially as the calls he sells expires and he continues to sell more covered calls, he profits from the calls he continues to sell even tho AMD isn't going up in price (he gets the premium he sold the calls for) he just needs to sell enough covered calls to cover the difference of the premium he paid for, for the calls he bought, versus the Strike Price of the Calls he bought and the price of AMD at Call Expiry.

If AMD stays at $39.5 or w/e its at now, the calls he owns now will be worth $39.5-25 = $14.50 on Jan 15th.

 **So essentially he just needs to sell enough Covered Calls with enough premium to match or beat the difference of the calls he bought. Which looks like $16.xx - $14.5 or like $1.50-$2.00**

And if AMD does happen to go up in price, the calls he bought will increase in value far more than than the calls he sells and he'll be making money.

* If AMD goes up: He makes money from the calls he bought.
* If AMD stays the same: He just needs to sell enough covered calls to cover the difference of $14.50 and the price he paid for the calls he bought.
* IF AMD goes down: He needs to sell even more covered calls to make up for depreciation of the calls he owns, or he needs to offload them to cut his loses.",ThotianaPolice,wallstreetbets,12.0

it makes it so that even if the stock price starts crashing and your 41c starts declining in value, that 42c starts declining in value as well, but since you sold it while it was still expensive youre actually gaining money as it declines in value.  so the prices of your +1 41c and -1 42c ride with each other.  you wont make any more money, but you wont lose any more money either.  its not exact for a couple reasons, but it beats the hell out of sitting there watching your profits evaporate
