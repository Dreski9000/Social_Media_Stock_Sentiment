0,2020-06-09,"Having missed out on the upswing; I have no qualms saying I‚Äôm ‚Äúfucked.‚Äù

I have 15-20% less than what I started with when ‚Äúprofessional investors‚Äù shat in a bucket of cash, threw it into the market, and have made ~30% on just Indexes in the last 2.5 Months.

On the other hand; someone just starting with the r/investing meme ‚ÄúTime In The Market‚Äù (TITM) and ‚ÄúDollar Cost Averaging‚Äù (DCA) mentality got some discounts on individual stocks or various Indexes. 

There‚Äôs a silver lining to everything, and sure we can meme Buffett, Icahn, etc getting screwed on some positions being Gay Bears, but isn‚Äôt it weak form Efficient Market Hypotheses (EMH) that says insider trading, etc throws the whole thing out of whack? 

I just find it impossible to *confidently* have a long term investment outlook or long-term mortgages; etc. How can someone *not* be ‚Äúnihilistic‚Äù when none of that pays off? YOLO‚Äôing and holding Wayfair made 5-6x for many people. We are constantly TOLD ‚Äúfallen angels aren‚Äôt real breh,‚Äù and yet that‚Äôs how you ‚Äúget rich‚Äù and not have to worry about fretting over some sub-par job and being relegated to a Wagie job which in itself can also be hard to get as the labor pool increases. It‚Äôs like an ever-increasing rat-race surrounded by ‚ÄúCommunists‚Äù who will start coming after you if you ‚Äúhave money‚Äù (but not ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù money). 

And yes I know someone can come in here saying ‚Äúbut you admitted you would have made back most your money if you just set it and forget it!‚Äù

My whole point is: this has been one massive stress test SCAM. ‚ÄúThey,‚Äù the ‚ÄúElites‚Äù whatever you want to call them, have learned so much from this Boondoggle. The ‚Äúmarket sell off‚Äù meme was retail investors when SHTF. Major Index like DOW bottomed at, what, ~$19,000, after the stampede for the exits? And then AFTER companies get bailouts and cash reserves are used up on stock buybacks; where do retail investors go? Back in to make some scraps before the NEXT pullback? 

I just find it screwed up because it‚Äôs becoming so obvious. People pull their cash; wait around for ‚Äúexternalities‚Äù to occur, but all that happened is banks, large firms, etc consolidate more control. I expect in 1-2 years housing to be more expensive than ever. They meme that it will ‚Äúbottom in about a year; return to complete normal end of 2022,‚Äù but the reality is Inflation controlled for *everything else* while luxuries SKYROCKETING. We have been sold a lie. We can ‚Äúafford‚Äù cheap consumer electronics, etc, but need a fucking 30 year mortgage.

0,2020-09-03,"Imo here's the tiers of garbage radio rock:

Post-post grunge - Also can be called ""post-nu metal"".  Bands like Seether, Staind, Sick Puppies, and Shinedown.  Apparently starting with the letter ""S"" is ideal.

Generic radio rock - Doesn't even deserve a specific category.  Bands include Nickelback, Creed, and Hinder.  Having a lead singer that sounds like he has a mental disability and/or raspy voice helps here.

White trash rock - Blatantly screams ""I'm trashy, obnoxious, and not ashamed of it"".  Bands include Buckcherry, Theory of a Dead Man, and Five Finger Death Punch.

Also as an interesting tidbit, Puddle of Mudd somehow manages to fit equally in all 3 of these categories.",Busch-Diesel,wallstreetbets,0.0
0,2020-09-03,"Skynyrd and Kenny Rogers are southern rock, which is distinctly different from the white trash rock I'm talking about. 

White trash rock is a genre typically associated with trashy white dudes.  Refer to memes like [this](https://pics.me.me/thumb_looks-like-five-finger-death-punch-is-playing-in-town-59236853.png), [this](https://pics.me.me/when-you-take-your-lady-to-a-five-finger-death-39853409.png), [this](https://i.redd.it/iqlbtjqih5i11.jpg), and [this](https://pics.onsizzle.com/Imgur-bbec57.png) for an idea of who is typically associated with this genre.  It has no southern influence.  The genre is just radio-friendly guitar riffs and song structure with ""edgy"" vocals.  FFDP pretty blatantly ""sold out"" when their cover of Bad Company became their top song.  They went from a heavy metal band with *some* personality to an even more generic hard rock band.  Buckcherry and Theory of a Dead Man perfectly fit this genre too with the ""unashamed trashy"" image, radio-friendly song structure, and ""edgy"" lyrics.  Refer to songs like *Lit Up, Crazy Bitch, Lowlife, Bitch Came Back,* and *Bad Girlfriend*.  Another staple of this genre is occasional ""ballad"" songs to balance out the edginess and create the image of being a serious band, *Medicate*, *Gone Away*, and *Sorry* are solid examples from each band.

When I say ""post post-grunge"" I'm not calling bands grunge.  ""Post-grunge"" is a pejorative label given to bands like Candlebox, Bush, and Live that combined the image and distorted sound of grunge with less heavy/abrasive music, often pop influences.  These bands were often accused of ""selling out"" since naturally the less offensive post-grunge music was more radio friendly than Alice in Chains and Stone Temple Pilots.  Often people will say Theory of a Deadman and Nickelback are post-grunge, but I'd argue it's better to split them off as a genre influenced by post-grunge.  Meanwhile Seether and Shinedown, they're derived from post-grunge *and* nu metal, which is why I'd call them ""post post-grunge"" or ""post-nu metal.""

Breaking Benjamin is a legitimate nu metal band that, while radio-friendly, isn't totally generic radio rock.  Tool couldn't be further from these genres, since they have basically no ""image"" that they try to uphold and they're not remotely afraid of making songs that don't fit the radio formula.",Busch-Diesel,wallstreetbets,0.0
