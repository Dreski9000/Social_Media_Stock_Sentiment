Say you get super lucky. Like last Friday with options on the sp500 index. It dropped around 10 points in the last ten minutes of the day. A put contract went from $30 to $260 in that time frame. Other strike selections went up similarly ($160 to $640).

0,2018-01-07,"Interesting. So you're really aiming for practically 90% rate of success, and that's probably boosted by using an index itself. With such a low delta value, are you ever having issues with liquidity? I attempted to go down to lower delta values on things like GOOGL, AMZN, and ran into liquidity issues so I steered away from it. Although on an index, this issue may not be present... I do like the stop loss strategy you employ though, I may decide to incorporate something similar. Makes sense using lots of capital with such a high probability trade, though. And yes I could imagine the commissions would be horrendous on 80-100 contracts, and you must be working with an immense amount of capital. 

I use a similar strategy with stocks as well. I typically only trade with trend though. Ex. AAPL = bullish, I will find a point where I see support and sell short put vertical a decent distance under that support area w/ 0.3 to 0.4 delta similar to you. I also base it off the underlying going below the support area initially identified when entering the trade. Seems to work out well.

Question though. Do you use any sort of scanner to find stocks that fit these conditions when looking to open credit spreads? That's the only issue I've recently run into. I mostly look for highly traded stocks with over 1Mil volume and liquid options, but I want to find other ones in an easier way. 

But yes I agree lol, it's definitely nice to speak with you as well. You seem to employ great risk management strategies and I'm sure trading has gone well for you so far. And yes I've done well so far this year too. I believe tech, materials, and financials will all continue to outperform this year. ",WSEnthusiast,wallstreetbets,0.0

0,2018-04-07,"* i should also mention you might need matching 32 bit excel/32 bit thinkorswim or 64 bit excel/64 bit thinkorswim. It might work otherwise, but idk

i figured out a pretty neat trick for buying calls/puts, but since i only use thinkorswim, this only applies to people who use it also.

You also have to be on a windows PC with excel 2010 or higher, so go away aapl fags

excel has a function called RTD() that pulls real-time data from another program that is currently running on your comp. thinkorswim supports this, so you can pull real time option prices and decide on which one requires the smallest move before break-even.

I have an excel file that i plug in the symbol, the expiration date of the options you are looking at, type(put or call), the strike you want to analysis at, and the interval between strikes.

i can seriously look at any stock and filter through all of the options and quickly pick out the option that requires the smallest move before i start making money. So far its worked pretty damn well, theres typically a couple strikes that only require a &lt;0.5% stock price move before they start earning.

this is probably geared more towards day traders, but its not like you couldnt use it for going long.

if youre ok with giving your email to a stranger on the internet, i can send you the excel file. probably some gay p0rn too since i know u fags like that stuff",moto455,wallstreetbets,0.0

8,2018-04-09,"That's a good question and I haven't traded long enough to really tell you precise percentages of what a slow day is vs a concern. $AAPL on average for the last 3 months is around 34 million shares/day and today was 28 million so you're talking a drop of roughly 18% of average volume, that's fairly disconcerting when the stock is going up at the rate it was. Volume rate of change charts are what I use to measure how we're doing and across the board volumes were low. After looking at charts day in and day out for the past 3 months you get used to this faux bull rally shit, happened last week and it happened again today. You can usually tell it's going to hit some major psychological resistance level and even if it breaks if the bull volume doesn't continue to keep it above that it usually spells trouble. AROON 5-minute was a little late to indicate bearish reversal but the overbought RSI coupled with breaking bearish on the 3-minute was a good indication. That and the consecutive black marabozu. 

Just put it this way. Unless we have great economic news that warrants a rally and there's no potential for bad news later in the day (today it was escalation of conflict in Syria and Xi's tariff announcement) then it's best to wait for that rally to show weakness and buy your puts. Oh ... and the position I opted against as I had to go out was up 75% at close, 4/11 $264 SPY puts. Just didn't want to risk not getting home to unload before what could be a gap up tomorrow.

5,2018-04-12,"Whenever you run that command you want to check for a few things:
 _____________________
Table 1:


First: 
Prob (F-statistic):	7.32e-33  

This number is really tiny which is good. If it is over 0.05 Ignore the whole damn thing. Literally. Just don't look at anything in the results, it's all nonsense. 



Adj. R-squared [0.438]
-  approx 44 % of apples movement can be explained by this regression.

________________

Table 2: 

Look at the column P&gt;!t!

Notice that the const row has a p greater than 0.05. Just completely ignore that row.

Now look at the X1 row in table 2, it's got a significant P value (It's less than 0.05). 

In this output each variable you add is called X1, X2, X3 etc. 

So if I had run the command as follows (AAPL, SPY, AMD, MU)
I would be looking at the impact of SPY, AMD, and MU on AAPL.
So table 2 would have the rows: Const, X1, X2, X3

Where X1 is SPY, X2 is AMD etc. 

The coef column tells you a change of 1 in SPY results in how much of a change in AAPL. 

So in this case, when the market goes up by 1, we would expect apple to go up by 1.17, and when the market goes down by 1 we would expect AAPL to go down by 1.17.

Everything beyond that, I'm still working on learning myself.

, I know the point of the jarque-Bera, and know the use and meaning of Skew, Kurtosis etc I wouldn't worry about all that right now.Have fun, run some multilinear regressions and see if you can completely explain (r &gt; 70 or so ) the movement of some stock using some indicators etc.

0,2018-05-04,"EDIT: the easy way to calculate this is 1 - (chances of your event not happening), which would just mean 1 - (not winning apple once out of 16 tries) or 1-(199/200)^16. if you want to understand why... 

&gt;16*(1/200)= 8% chance of getting Apple stock at least once.

your probability of winning Apple stock exactly once from exactly one friend isn't equal to 1/200 though, so you can't multiply by 16 to get that result. if you don't understand, look at it like this: 


chance of friend 1 getting you AAPL (p1): (1/200)^1

chance of friend 2-16 NOT getting you AAPL (q1): (199/200)^15

**chance of you getting AAPL exactly once from friend 1: p1\*q1 = 0.461%. this represents the whole situation now (as opposed to 1/200 = 0.5%), since 16 independent events have occurred and we MUST account for all 16 of them.**

chance of you getting AAPL exactly once from friend 2: this is the same thing as above. p2*q2 = 0.461%. 

so there are 16 ways to win AAPL exactly once, and your chance is 0.461% for each one of them. so probability of you getting AAPL exactly once (regardless of which friend) = 16 * 0.461% = 7.383%. this number is equal to the first term of the sum.


the second term gets more involved because there are 16!/(14!*2!) = 120 ways of winning two Apple stocks from two given friends. why there are 120 ways: 

there are 16! ways to arrange 16 friends: (16 friends)\*(16 - 1 friend you didn't choose =15)\*...\*(last friend remaining) so 16\*15\*...\*1 or 16!. 

there are 14! ways to arrange 14 of the losers.

there are 2! ways to arrange 2 of the winners.

since we don't care about how the friends are arranged, we can reduce the number to 16!/(14!*2!) = 120 ways to win apple twice. this is expressed as 16c2. 

this is multiplied by the probability of winning AAPL exactly twice from any two given friends, which is: (1/200)^2 \* (199/200)^14 = 0.00233%, so the second term of the sum is 13c2 (=120) \* 0.00233% = 0.28%. 

this is repeated 14 more times, which is notated in the summation form Σ from i=1 to 16 of the expression [16Ci \* (1/200)^i \* (199/200)^(16-i)]. this is generalized as nCi * p^i * q^(n-i), where n is the number of events possible, and i is the each iteration of it from 1 to n. if you want it to happen twice or more instead of once or more, start from 2, etc. use sigma to sum it up. 

all summed up, it's 7.383% + 0.28% + ... + 16c16 * (1/200)^16 * (199/200)^0 (this term is pretty much equal to zero) = 7.707%.

0,2018-05-05,"kind of like wax is saying, higher IV means greater risk greater reward.  So when a seller is taking the risk of selling you an option into earnings, a merger, whatever, they want you to pay for that in addition to your time premium above what the normal IV is (HV).

If you're playing the long side (directional plays rarely work out), try to play post event or pre event - not the event itself.  Try to find instances where HV is greater than IV and hope that IV rises to meet HV due to something like Buffet buying AAPL stock.  

The IV/HV game is mostly luck if you're on the long side.  Whereas if you're on the short side you win more often than not.  Just think of a bell curve with standard deviations - most of the time nothing happens.  Short's win and the long's lose, but when the long's win ride that motherfucker out and win big.

In order to make your strategy perform better than a CD the strategy would have to be repeatable for an entire year.
  
My point is the spread you found between the current AAPL Call and Put typically would not be the same from period to period, and could eventually make the repeatable trade yield less than current CD rates.
 
In that case I guess you could find a different stock besides AAPL where the IV is higher and the difference in calls and puts would give a positive gain again.",oldgamer321,wallstreetbets,0.0

There are 2 answers here, but they arent mutually exclusive.  Either its a mass flight to quality due to recession fears or the buy backs are meaning that higher stock prices arent leading to higher total cap for the companies.

AMZN is basically trying to grow in any direction that they can at least break even on.

9,2018-06-01,"If you want to bring in more income, then yes, you can sell options on your AAPL. For the most part, you'd just use it to hedge against a trend. For example, if you believe AAPL will fall, then you sell a call option at the money (ATM) or slightly out of the money (OTM) because the call buyer will exercise only if AAPL rises and meets or exceeds the strike price. In return, you get paid the money the call option buyer pays, called the premium. So for every 100 shares of AAPL, you can sell an option in whatever direction and receive that premium. Your risk, then, is losing those AAPL shares, but hopefully your selling price of the stock is higher that what you bought them in for in 2006. 

But you will always keep that premium. Always. It can help to offset some losses you take if you are forced to sell stock at a lower price than what you bought in for. For example, you buy 100 shares at $10 and you believe it will drop to $6, but would still like to own the shares even if it drops to $6. You could sell a call option at strike $7, so the call option itself is worth $3. You will receive $300, no matter what. If the stock price falls lower than $7, like $6, the call is NOT exercised but now your stocks are worth $6 instead of $10. So you lost $400 ($10-$6), but you got that $300 premium, so your total net worth is down by only $100. But you are still keeping the shares! You can hold and waiting for the stock to rise up again.

You can also sell a call option with a strike ABOVE the current stock price. The downside is that the call option you sell will be worth less (since the call option buyer has the right to buy stock at higher price instead of lower price), and you limit your potential gains on the stock. For example, stock is at $10 and you sell a call option at strike $12 for $0.20 (so you get $20 premium since 0.20*100 = 20). Say stock moves to $20. You COULD have sold your stock at $20 IF you didn't sell that option. That would have netted you $10 gain per share (20-10). But you did sell that call option, and you can bet ass your stock WILL be sold at the $12 strike price, so the guy on the other end will buy stock at $12 and sell for $20. This is what limits your gains. You can't sell at the market price anymore, you have to sell at the strike price.

So what's your total gain? You bought 100 shares at $10 and sold at $12. $2 a share profit and 100 shares, so $200 from the shares. But you also received that premium from selling the call option, which is $20. In total, you gained $220.

Also, since you OWN the stock, yes you will collect dividends. However, if the call option is exercised in such a way that the stock is delivered to the other person (2 days settlement stock period still applies) before or on ex-div (forgot which), then you will no longer receive those dividends.

10,2018-06-01,So say aapl went $5 over the strike price today. You can sell to close the position so you wouldn't have to exercise the contracts and the sell price of the contracts would be the $5 profit for each share since there is no theta left and the delta would most likely be 1.

I can’t get max pain historical data, I’m assuming I could if I wanted to pay, but for the stocks I have tracked it, for limited time (AMD, AAPL) I don’t think it’s right even 50% of the time.  For instance max pain for AMD this Friday is $12.  By that logic I should load up on $13 puts, which are at $1 per contract now, by Friday each contract *would* be worth $100… I mean AMD could plummet to &lt;$13 by Friday but I don’t think it’s likely.  Max pain for MU last Friday was $54, and yet it ended at $61.

Part of the flaw in the logic is that people selling puts and calls aren’t exactly losing money if they get assigned.  Sure it might not be their preference, but having to lose 100 shares in the case of a covered call isn’t awful as long as you had some gain in the underlying, and getting 100 shares from a sold put isn’t awful assuming the shares don’t then plummet to zero, and no matter what they already got their premium either way.",Gahvynn,wallstreetbets,2.0

GENERAL

\- stop buying FDs

\- buy at least 2.5+ months in the future

\- buy ITM/ATM

\- consolidate positions

SPECIFIC

\- drump my FB put FDs (wow, glad i did that early)

\- drump my TSLA put FDs

CHANGES

\- sold off $TQQQ calls for profit

\- drumped $FB and $TSLA put FDs

\- purchased $ROKU $43.0C 10/19 (2 contracts)

\- purchased $PYPL $82.5C 10/19 (1 contract)

\- purchased $AAPL $190C 10/19 (1 contract)

you'll notice $SBUX/$F/$GE puts -- i bought these a week or two ago, they just didn't fit on yesterday's screenshot.  pump or drump?

also note - $NVDA, $INTC, $JD contracts are all worth like $0.06 so dont cry for me argentina.  $ADBE call is worth $21

This portfolio would absolutely obliterate the broader market.  I bet the 5-10 year historic performance of this basket outperforms QQQ and SPY by a preposterous margin.

EDIT 2: For any curious minds, below is how the Asian Tigers portfolio performs against QQQ and SPY.

3,2018-08-04,"Uh yeah I had a chance to meet one of the people in Vanguard’s security lending program and she said she can’t remember the last time they paid a rebate. The idea of it was insulting to her. Why the hell should someone who’s borrowing from US expect us to give them money for it? I get that you can still come out ahead if you invest the collateral aggressively, but VG prefers to invest very conservatively in money market securities.

They require all borrowers to overcollateralize, so a $100 loan may require $103 of collateral for example. And then the rebate often goes in the other direction. They give VG $103 of collateral, but VG only has to give $102 back when they close out the position.

So VG makes money off of the “reverse rebate”, they make interest with how they invest the collateral, they make money off of having more collateral than normal.

They get that “reverse rebate” because they generally only loan out securities that are harder to obtain. They don’t loan out AAPL and GOOGL that are easy to get. They’re loaning their mid-caps, small-caps, international securities. And borrowers pay through the nose to borrow those because there’s very little available. 

And Vanguard is usually the biggest holder of those rare securities. So if someone wants to take out a big short on those stocks, they basically HAVE to come to Vanguard.

If you keep buying calls on large caps all through the rest of August and Sept, you will get burned. That’s all I’m trying to warn you of. If you think I’m completely wrong and full of shit you should buy some sept and nov SPY calls tomorrow, or even better buy more AAPL and FB calls because I wouldn’t touch that shit with a 10ft pole. I would buy puts soon though.

When we broke 2852 for the first time today time I started the process of building up another sizable bet against the S&amp;amp;P and Nasdaq. I got some sept $285Ps that were beaten down 20% on the day. The price was just too good to resist for the almost free delta, and it will almost certainly get lower in the coming days/weeks. I’ll be adding, buying Sept Nov and Jan $285-290Ps all the way to all time highs if you‘re selling.

3,2018-08-06,"I'm not sure what the guy you replied to was thinking or if he unintentionally made a typo, but options are themselves contracts. Each contract deals with 100 shares of the underlying, not ""100 contracts"".

When you buy options, you are essentially purchasing the option to buy or sell shares of a particular stock from or to somebody at a specific price within a specific time range for some amount of money (the premium).

So, if I buy a call option for AAPL with a strike of 206, I now have the ability to buy 100 shares of AAPL stock at 206 per share.

Looking for what to play tomorrow, likely will be ETSY, WTW, and CROX. Maybe 2k of the progress screenshot is from bets other than selling puts on earnings.

For a position like this that’s why I’d split it up and look for more leverage with the OTM calls and sell calls against the deep itm calls (diagonals) Personally I’d by 2020 $100’s because that’s a lot of premium to pay, and I’d want the additional leverage and I’m very bullish on msft. You can do this with any stock, but msft works really good because it’s *not* prone to running away and is easy to sell calls against, not that it doesn’t, just a lot less likely to pull what $AMZN and $AAPL have been doing..

Their UI is not as easy to use as RH and you don't have a real time chart of your account balance that shows the increase and decrease in dollars and cents every second like you do with RH, so I use it more as a separate fund for my long stuff and dividend stocks.

Their support is also decent as they have an in app messaging platform so you can send in a ticket from the app and receive a response.

I also got a free share of AAPL when I opened, (no referral needed), and today they announced a referral program in addition to it.

To be honest, since opening a WeBull account, I haven't put a dime into my RH account, but have added to my WeBull account.

They also offer full trading hours pre and after market for no fees.

Honestly, though, my best investments have been buying and holding AMZN, AAPL, GOOG, FB and SPXL- even better than my options over the last 2 years. I love SPXL and weight it heavily in my non-trading IRA. 

For call spreads you would simply be selling a call lower than the one your buying. Look at the call prices and it makes sense. Being that stocks generally go up, I don’t bet on them going down. 

My one exception is on UXYZ, which I buy and sell continuously. Beta slippage ravages this fund and it pretty much always drops like a rock. Sell call spreads on Trump doing something stupid and buy back when things call down. 

Being that I’ve only been selling options in this bull market, I can’t say exactly what my strategy will be when(not if) the market turns around. I’ll probably sell a put and if it get exercised, then I’ll sell covered calls until things turn around.

People are buying these phones on credit, not in cash, and are too irresponsible to realize any better.

26,2018-09-03,"I’m not sure how that system works, because I don’t use it. How large is the spread? $0.50? If so, they want the full potential lose, without factoring in your credit. 

TDA works like this(numbers are not actual):

Say you sell an AAPL 210 put for $0.60 and buy a 205 put $0.10. 

Spread = $5, and is of course linked to 100 shares, so the max potential loss is $500. This is the amount you would have to spend to buy the shares at $210 and sell for $205. 

However, being that you have a $0.50 = $50 credit, your total loss is capped at $450. Thus, you could make an 11% profit (50/450.) They should require $450 to sell this put spread. 

The only major caveat is when one option expires ITM and the other is OTM. If that happens and there is a large move before the market opens on Monday, you could lose more than the $450 theoretical max. Hence, why I do not let options expire unless they are 10% or more OTM and even that makes me nervous. 

You can sell far OTM spreads for conservative 1%-%10 returns or go crazy and looks for 200% returns, but that all depends on your risk tolerance. There is a sweet medium for everyone.

43,2018-09-03,"I only sell vertical spreads and my approach is to monitor each one independently. My strategy is probably too conservative for this subreddit for the most part, however it works for me. 

I usually aim for 20-30% profit and the resulting timeline varies from 3mo-12mo. Additionally, I only sell options far out of the money; generally put spreads no less than 10% below the current stock price, but I prefer 20%. 

Some stocks like HD have kind of stalled out, so my options haven’t moved much while still 8mo from exp. in this case I continue to hold

Others like AAPL, AMZN, V shot up and I was able to make 40-70% of my expected returns in just a month or so. When this happens I don’t get greedy and either roll them over or close the position. 

I almost never keep options until they expire, because there usually isn’t much profit left to be had on vertical spreads out of the money. 

Also, keep an eye on, what I call, ‘associated stock risk’ and make sure you don’t have an insane amount leveraged. Don’t forget that options that expire on Fridays and not executed until Monday at the bell, so if there is a large move over the weekend you can end up losing a ton of money.

1,2018-09-06,"All of AMZNs dips today were mirrored in most nasdaq stocks representing either a “broad tech sell off” (bullshit) or an overreaction to fears of possible tech regulation due to todays Senate hearing that went extremely poorly for many reasons.  The dip was too coordinated to be result of many money managers, only possibility is Papa Bezos withdrawing some Blue Origin monies which he does every year, that is the only whale large enough to cause the sell off and that is unlikely. If you watched the Senate committee meeting you saw that **it went terribly**, however regulation would never occur because the technological challenges are far too complex to propose any regulation, **AND** this *should* only affect social media sites and the like, where their platform is free because **YOU are the product**, this is absolutely not the case with AMZN. Trade war won’t affect AMZN, it is China-proof. AMZN will never face regulation because the US antitrust laws are put into place to prevent monopolies from being able to unfairly hurt customers, AMZN is most customer focused retailer **ever**, absurd to realistically postulate AMZN tried in antitrust.

TLDR; 
Widespread coordinated tech selloff? Unlikely. 
Overreaction to fear of gov regulation? Very likely, yet very unwarranted. 
Anyone who bought AMZN today got sweet deal.

2.	P/E should be positive, or have a damn good reason not to be. (Early stage startup, low cap, growth burn’
3.	P/E should be reasonably lowish for its age and growth potential (Compare AAPL to AMZN. These are established companies. Is the growth potential accurately reflected in PE?)
4.	Momentum
5.	Fundamentals on the specific contract are important. RH makes it easy to buy contracts with 0 active interest. Aim for around 3 month term, and as deep ITM as reasonable for Delta and Theta.

If you don’t know what any of that means, just buy SPY calls three months out that only require 3% to break even.

25,2018-09-09,"Back at you.

I think it’s about consolidation in part. Instead of being involved across the board and diluting potential impact, he chose to be highly involved at one. 

Put the money there, own higher stake and help create an even stronger future for Apple with Berks wholehearted help and the incentive to do so for his successors, as future Berk profitability will rely in part on Apples continued success. 

Amazon probably isn’t interested in outside help to innovate. They already innovate and do new crazy things all the time. 

AAPL definitely can expand it’s book, and currently has much better financials than AMZN. So I think AAPL is ultimately more receptive and needs Berk more than AMZN would. 

Again, I see this as Warren handing over the reigns, in part, to AAPL in some ways. Basically he feels better about his shareholders futures in an intertwined relationship that is mutually beneficial to both. Which all ensures health and longevity for his own company - his legacy. 

I thought he was losing his mind too, but this makes sense to me as giving Warren benefit of the doubt. It’s the prudent thing to do imo given how prolific he’s been - to at least run an analysis where he is right and why he could be right.

They are involved in financial services as evidenced by Netflix trying to get away from using AAPL pay. 

Buffet may not like cars but he won’t be actively involved much longer. So his opinion there is not an issue. I agree outright buying may be a good solution.

If AAPL further delves into payment processing, Berkshire has a giant catalogue of companies for AAPL to be involved with. It’s a brilliant idea really for Warren to continue to yolo on AAPL. 

Besides just capital injection it’s a great marriage as far as the expanded book of options Apple can get involved in, that Berk brings to the table. The insurance industry is one thing Berk is heavily involved in and it is ripe for innovative solutions - and it is highly profitable. 

I didn’t really understand why Warren was so seemingly singley focused on AAPL. So I thought long and hard on it and if you run an analysis with the lense I just provided, I think it’ll make more sense to you as well. ",GankstaCat,wallstreetbets,27.0

29,2018-09-09,"This isn’t about a comparison with AMZN.

AAPL looking like it’ll be in the car game in the coming years as well. There will be many other industries they break into, like they did with watches. 

Buffet likely figures that if he can’t live forever and run his company, that he will fuse it with the most valuable company in the world. Which bodes well for Berks future well after Warren is gone.

Warren via Berkshire is trying to inject as much in as he can so that Berk always has a spot at the table for leading AAPL. Berk is involved in so many industries that the relationship between the two will continue to be mutually beneficial. What AAPL is today won’t be what it is 10-15 years from now.

Biggest piece of advice I can give you, set a limit order for the price you wanna exit at and then do as someone ekse suggested..
 don't look at them until late this month. If your limit triggers that's great, you get tendies. If it doesn't,  you're muchmore likely to be at a better price target than you are now. REMEMBER, we did just go through 4-5 straight down days.

TSLA calls - its back down near $260 support.  Last few slides its not gone below ~$250 and seems to rebound fairly quick.  Massive selloff just seems like an overreaction to his SEC tweet.  



MU calls - lowest its been since shitty guidance is ~$41 and support appears to be strong at ~$42.50. At current share price looks like its primed for another pump and dump.  Since ER has been up between $45-47 a couple times before quickly dropping again.

AAPL stock at 225  share. 
1. Buy a very ITM call on AAPL. I bought mine 190 strike for 50.00 with expiration Jun 2020 a few weeks ago. 

When AApl goes up a bit, sell a call. Technically your break even is 240 so you can sell calls around there for like 100/150 dollars every 40 or so days with zero risk.  Do the math, even if AAPL doesnt move at all you've ended up with a lot of income by almost 2 years from now and your option expires  with 3500 dollars of value. If you're trying to make more income, sell your call lower and hope AApL doesn't shoot up.  If you're more bullish don't sell any calls. It seems like a magical strategy to me but well see.

As a guy who played AAPL well today, I went with my gut.

-AAPL was one of the few companies not hit hard in the last month

-it rallied to near all time highs this week

-I asked myself, with the market being how it’s been this last month would I keep buying aaple at 220+ or sell off, answer was sell

-rumors of general slow down on sales numbers

all in all it really felt like it was far more likely these earnings would bring apple down to where the rest of the market already is, in other words aaple had simply not corrected yet.

If aaple had dropped down to 200-205 I’d have been all in on calls for these earnings.

I realize you want to gamble, but taking FDs or near term calls you have a small chance of large profit and a big chance of loss.

Since you’re talking AAPL and I’m a total amateur here’s my anecdotal expertise. I’ve been in Apple calls this month... gradually making a modest profit, selling when up and averaging down when low. April 220’s were best, locking in modest gains of $100-$300 per sell. My January calls are only green on solid Green Day’s and theta totally fucked my November call, no chance of it turning a profit. 

I had about $12k in AAPL calls on any given day, which is well under 50k. Assuming you actually get this much cash you won’t be out of the market for longer calls.

Yes I’m advocating non-YOLO gambles- I was 40% down and once you’re there it’s all about recovery. For me anyway. I don’t want 200% returns or bust, Just +$500-1000 a week if I’m lucky...  to break even before 2020.",make_it_stain,wallstreetbets,20.0

If it does the ""comes up just a few cents less of your short leg"" thing, you'd still want to sell off your long leg. If it hit between your legs, the short side would expire worthless and you would automatically exercise your long side, selling at whatever that strike is (and funding your account accordingly). You would then be short 100 shares of AAPL and would have to buy them back on Monday to close the trade out. 

I promise this is said with love:  you shouldn't be playing with options yet. You need to feel this thing out a bit more before getting in balls deep. You don't understand how all of this works yet.

15,2018-11-03,"If you buy a call, you're betting that the price is gonna go up. So you can pick a call option that is either ITM (In the money) or OTM (Out of the money) right? 

a ITM call option would be say, AMD is trading at 15$ and you buy a call for 15$ amd. If it goes up at all, you'll make money. If it goes down at all, you'll lose your money. 

And the reverse it true for puts. 

ITM options are more expensive, since you're more guaranteed to make a profit, while OTM options are cheap, cause you have a tiny percentage at actually getting to the strike price of your calls / puts. 

However, for example, I've been buying otm snap puts and calls. I got lucky cause I bought a call right as SNAP started to rally because people thought maybe AMZN or someone would buy them out. So I made a few bucks there. Now I have a bunch of SNAP puts for 11/16 and 11/23 because I can only afford short term OTM option contracts. I'm hoping to sell these contracts at a profit later, hopefully if SNAP tanks like, 20-50 cents.

I was able to double my money with some cheap otm contracts anyways, but it's a huge gamble. There has to be people willing to buy those contracts in the first place etc. 

To expand on what OP did though, he bought a bunch of call contracts for a certain strike price (215$) and AAPL ended up getting close to that strike price. Because it was much closer to the strike price, the contracts he owned were worth way more (Because the chance that you can make money is increased). I'm sure he bought those contracts months away, and paid much less for them. So he sold them today for like, x% gains. Looks to be around 50% or so. 

Since it's definitely a gamble to do plays on earning reports, the mofo just decided to be safe and cash out his AAPL call contracts and shit before the earnings report came out, and it ended up being his saving grace cause if he held, he would be down 5-6 figures.

""Be ready to walk away from a deal."" The main points of the deal probably have been agreed to already. Today's call between the leaders was enough for the GEOTUS to hint at Xi's willingness to make a deal. The cabinet has been tasked to write up a rough draft agreement. Considering that Thanksgiving falls so close to the G-20 summit, the details will need to be hammered out by the 2nd week of November. Trump will have rallies every day till midterms. Listen for what he says off script about the trade negotiations. He'll all but tell you where they are. Consider the man and his needs. He's a winner, and needs to be seen as such. How great will he look at the summit if He and Xi stand together following a palatable agreement? That's the goal. Xi knows that his window to get some semblance of a good deal for China will slam shut if Trump goes to Argentina without an agreement. ""Negotiate from a place of strength.""

I guess you could also long the VIX going into elections. 

Longer term AAPL options also prob a good idea. They crushed earnings and Rev, who gives a fuck if they don’t report iPhone numbers.

You’re option should’ve already increased $22 I believe. So you bought it for 122 right? You can sell it for 144, well that’s what it would’ve been worth if you sold it before close. Options can only be traded during market hour 930-4.  You’ll option will probably worth more in the morning though. But be careful cause option prices fluctuate  in the morning a lot. 

But you can sell your option whenever you want for it’s current value.
Or you can exercise an option, which would be in your case buying 100 shares of aapl at 210. That’s worthless unless AAPL goes  above 210. Because you could buy 100 at 210 and sell them all right away for 215 if that’s where AAPL is

To me to look, it's definitely better return in long term than AAPL and CGC that I was holding.

Calls are for high return so it comes with high risk as well of course, but like you said it's not a bad bet.
Maybe I'll spead half for longer expropriation date like next Feb, $40 and rest on next week call $34 and $35.

* $RYAAY pilot strike put play
* $AAPL q2 earnings call - followed daddy Buffett
* $VMW call - heard a tip from a WSB thread and lost my money
* $DBX call - heard a tip from a WSB thread and lost my money

* $TGT q2 earnings play - was undervalued from my calc, mobile app and mobile site traffic was up a shit ton on some dd sites. Figured that their mobile presence would be the thing investors would be looking at in order to compete with $AMZN
* $FB q3 earnings call - lost 90% of my trade. RIP. still extremely bullish but sticking to stock only with this one for now
* $ZG long term put - been looking for a house and the company is shit with tough competitors + going into mortgages/flipping houses

Current play - $NFLX 3/15/19 $290.25 long term put - Overvalued, $DIS will eat it's lunch when it finally comes out. Business model is flawed because it doesn't have the infrastructure like Disney and other studios to pump out and compliment OC

15,2018-11-08,"Here's what I'm up to:

1. Positions:
   1. 17 x LUV 12/21 55C. Currently up 45% and plan to hold through November. I see a big pop coming due to cyclicality (Check the LUV chart mid-Nov through mid-January) and lower fuel prices.
   2. 3 x AAPL 12/21 $220C. Bought today and think there's huge upside through the rest of the year.
   3. A few other small positions in MSFT, AAPL and T.
2. Where am I after OCT? Up 20% this week with a $3k account balance that was at $8k the beginning of OCT. My low was about $1k. My breakeven at this point is $7k.
3. Lessons:
   1. HOLD LONG POSITIONS even in times of doubt. Example: I had Nov. calls on SBUX and Puts on GE that would have saved my account balance but I let them go for break even or a little more. My gut was to keep these but weak hands are weak hands.
   2. Don't react to day-to-day movements unless you're skilled, can afford the losses or focused on day trading. Noob emotions will ruin you fast. Your actual job is more important.
   3. Focus only on a small amount of positions/companies that you are confident about. At one point I think I had 30 open positions and most were garbage YOLO's. I fed into the FOMO.
   4. CLOSE SHORT TERM POSITIONS if you're closing in on expiry and losing or only slightly winning (unless you have insider knowledge or solid DD otherwise). Stop being greedy or overly optimistic. The best trades I see on here are big money positions that makes 10-25% quickly. Burn a day trade if you have to. Don't overextend yourself with FD's that trick you into holding. Example: One day a couple weeks ago I was up  80% to $1800 on TWTR calls. I held looking for more loot and they expired worthless.  I had multiple chances to pull the money at break-even or minor losses. I didn't want to be wrong. I was wrong.
   5. Gamble with money you're comfortable losing so that you don't feel suicidal.

Anyways, happy trading y'all! Keep it fun! Take all my advice with a grain of salt. I've only been doing this since August.",muchtouch,wallstreetbets,15.0

Also you will get margin if you put $25,000 into for example TD Ameritrade, you will get $100,000 on margin to spend on Shares.

Imagine now what you will make with $90,000 in Shares of Apple or AMD or etc.. 

Use that money on Shares with margin, not options. You will lose it with options. With shares you can just wait and you won't have to wait if you buy $90,000 of shares right after we have a huge minus Dow down 400-800 points day.

Just wait for the next big red day and then buy in slowly with like $5000 orders of shares at a time very slowly as it drops and buy more if it keeps dropping every other week.

Nonetheless, hedging for me is ER bets on an individual stock and then opposite bets on that stock's industry. If AAPL had crushed earnings, QQQ was gonna go through the roof (possibly), so in the event that AAPL dives, it's likely QQQ is gonna dive too.

Apple OTM calls, QQQ OTM puts probably a 1:2 ratio. Apple jumps, QQQ will likely gain by that amount or less, so my QQQ puts won't be affected as much as my Apple calls are. Apple drops, my calls go to shit, but because I have twice as many QQQ puts, it ends up evening out. The strikes are all gut feeling or price-dependent, nothing insightful or Quant-like there.

61,2018-11-09,"First, this is one of the few real posts in the subreddit. I agree with others about wanting to see some of your bets and/or rationalizing exact call/put figures.

I agree with so much of your thesis. I’d like to add to your positioning on tech: Q4 isn’t going to be pretty. The big guns of AAPL, NVDA, INTC, AMD, AMAT, MU all have issues and/or anticipate a slowdowns moving forward. The larger picture is that we have broke away from Moore’s Law. It’s taking longer than 2 years to reach the next proverbial peg in design/performance. In the case of Intel, we are well behind their original timetable for smaller, more powerful chips. Similar stories for those in the tech/semi fields. On the consumer side, I think we’ve reached a tipping point regarding product pricing (AAPL and NVDA specifically). Less innovation or bang-for-your-buck. Enough product generations of this + rising prices = lower sales.

Tech companies that also provide some form of commerce grab my attention. AMZN, EBAY, SQ.

I have mixed feelings about how to play tech as a whole. I’m not sure if it’s better to go after a tech-centric etf like QQQ (holds a high % of AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, INTC, etc) or target the likes of AMD, AMAT,  NVDA directly. Post-Christmas dates for options look attractive right now.

19,2018-11-12,"Firstly I wouldn't buy such short dated options if you can afford longer dated.  3 months is a good rule of thumb as that gives your position time to recover.  Also, when purchasing calls/puts generally its a pretty good idea to do a spread.  Yes spreads cap your upside but they also prevent the bleed that is theta burn and you can make spreads pretty wide.  You're mostly in tech right now.  AAPL, SQ, AMZN(not tech but is priced as a crazy growth company), NFLX, ES(not tech but broadly correlated).  If you want to keep your portfolio the same and just control the risk then I'd sell some legs to turn all your calls into spreads and Id look at opening maybe one or two shorts.  You could look into a QQQ put as a hedge against your entire portfolio.  In order to give more suggestions I need to know your outlook.  I dont like giving blatant buy/sell advice because your account value is larger than mine, but I'm personally a bear.  An idea might be you could do covered calls on all your shares until value returns.  APPL and SQ are both volatile enough to likely have good OTM options you can sell.",Negido,wallstreetbets,19.0

This can include buying immediately after the market breaks out to the upside from a technical pattern on the charts or selling immediately after the market breaks to the downside. Dealers and institutional traders will exploit this behavior by buying when weak hands traders sell and selling when weak hands traders buy. This forces the weak hands out before the market starts to move in the originally desired direction.

They're good exams for learning about the markets, trading, and most types of securities. But they really won't make you a better day trader in itself - fundamental and technical analysis isn't a huge part of the exam.

People in the ""industry"" will say that the exam tests a knowledge base that is ten feet wide, but only three inches deep.

edit: and once you work in the industry you may end up wary of these types of short term bets and become more of a long term investor. You see *all* the failed bets that don't get posted on the internet. But you also see the ultra high net worth investors too, so YMMV.

I come here for stock picks, ideas, laughs, and news. I come here to learn, from success and failure. I would never blame r/wsb for any losses, but I would give props for gains. The reason I wouldn’t blame for losses is because I didn’t do what I was supposed to do — made the wrong play in the wrong way. 

I’d never heard of AMD. I learnt about it here and it’s my favorite stock to play. I’ve made more money on AMD this year than big boy Buffett has made on AAPL this year!

Also, the “I read it so you don’t have to,” and other informational posts like that... fantastic. I learn more from those than a semester of business college. They’re gold. They’re plain and perfect. 

I don’t play the stock market for 3% gains. Fuck that. I wanna make some fat cash. I’ve woken up to -$2000.00 and +$2000.00. Neither phase me anymore. It’s like poker, once you start looking at the chips as money, you’re fucked. You look at chips as leverage, towers of power.

But you also have to know when to hold em and know when to fold em. I’ve taken losses that would have been larger losses had I not sold. I’ve also lost gains in selling too early. 

ANY GAIN IS A WIN 🙏

But you also have to have a goal. Money management.

If Wall Street Bets ever went away, I would be very upset. This is the most non-biased stock market forum that exists. There’s a place for all of the other financial subreddits, but it takes a special person to hang with us. High risk, big dreams. 

One more thing, I’m in California. I get up at 5am because the market opens at 6:30. My job starts at 10am. I’ve done this for 15 years. I haven’t checked lately, this has been my toughest year, but I’ve been making around $20,000/year. It’s a modest amount, but I’ve learnt more than I can learn at a $60,000/year business school. 

One last thing, my pops put all of his savings into some hedge fund in 2007. I think it was like $10,000. Anyway, it took him 4 years to get back to even. 

Anyway, much love and thanks to everyone for their contributions. I read almost every thread every day. 

Don’t change WSB!

The recovery was playing AAPL and AMZN to ATH. The drop was Elon smoking a joint on the Joe Rogan podcast. I had puts and sold for a loss the day before. Now I’m here... with $4.

3,2018-12-12,"I mean, that's simplifying it, but almost. There was this thing we used to do, called DD. It meant we studied individual stocks, because back in the before time the market didn't move as one. What would happen was you'd start to notice cycles. Some of the best meme stocks became that way, like V, MSFT, AAPL, and AMZN. Shit, even FB at one point. Once you figured out the cycle you wait for the entry point. You see entry point, you buy for 3 months out. Then you wait. 2 months in, you cash in for tendies. This was the extent of long term investing. For short term fun you pick a weekly FD or two and gamble on those, buying on Monday and selling on Thursday. More often than not the conversation on Fridays was around which one had earned the most, since they had all gone up in some way. It was an innocent time, and it made me believe that I was good at this. It turns out any idiot can be good at this when all it does is go up. Then February happened, and made a lot of people realize that this shit don't always go up. I learned some lessons then, but then we pretty much went back to business as usual. This feels different, because of the massive trading channel and the length of time. February was quick and violent, but then we started going up again.

8,2018-12-12,"AMZN isn't really a run of the mill tech company. They can use their massive cash flow to enter a new market, run at a loss for longer than the competition, once they're a monopoly they can charge whatever they want because any new market entrant can be crushed by merely dropping profitability to zero or negative plus they now have a de facto first-mover advantage.

So all that to say, yes, they'll have a billion percent per year profit forever--until the EU and DOJ step in...if they step in. Of course, they could just pull a Microsoft and save their competition like MSFT did to prevent AAPL from going to the dustbin of history. It would be wiser to just give them a very small share, though--maybe not build them into the world's largest company by enterprise value.

TL;DR AMZN is a marketing company instead of a tech company. Also, it's a massive tax scam which evades taxes for the ultra-wealthy because you're not bothered with dividends which are positively stupid from a value perspective and all the capital gains are stepped up to current basis on death which permits massive intergenerational wealth transfer which is exempt from estate taxes and federal taxes.",BikiniATroll,wallstreetbets,8.0
