2. Are you saying GameStop will make their own video games? 
I disagree that MSFT/Nintendo/Sony don't have a lot of b2c sales:
Here is the PS4 full game software digital download ratio (which can be found in the Sony Supplemental for their earnings releases):  
2015: 19%

2019: 55%

PLTR works with both of those industries, likely because they are some of the most historically bloated industries in the world. Decades of no bid contracts, anti competition, govt subsidies, and political protections have enabled wasteful spending &amp; gluttonous dividends. These habits protect complacency within hiring and management hierarchies and created a near perfect entry for papa Thiel and Alex Karp.

PLTR is just an enterprise data OS, but they get a bad wrap because of the aforementioned terry hunting and outspoken usage of big data. MSFT &amp; GOOG &amp; AAPL all do similar stuff with data, but they aren't ""mysterious"" systems explicitly linked to profiting from killing terrys. They are simply more understood by the average consumer, and create the illusion of data privacy protections between systems.

I think PLTR is a good platform because at the core it's an efficiency platform. Yes it has fancy tech and software but it seems to do three things very well:

\- create business intelligence analysts from workforces with low technical skills

The Redmond, Washington-based company‚Äôs lease covers 85,000 square feet at 9800 NE Gibbs Drive. Marketing materials for Ambercreek highlight its access to Highway 26 and the outdoors. The building was on the market for quite some time, the source said.

Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) had been searching for space in the Portland area for its cloud division since before the pandemic, the Business Journal reported in July. While it's unclear what Microsoft plans to pay for rent, Ambercreek's pricing has been marketed at $22 per square foot.

&gt;Even if we both agree that they are 4 sectors in one. If you took all 4 of those divisions and broke them into 4 standalone companies, I don't believe the valuation of all 4 as a stand alone company would add to the value Tesla is currently trading at. 

Does this work for any big company? Like if you broke apple into a phone company, a tablet. Company, a watch company, etc I doubt it would get close to their market cap.

Could probably do the same with Microsoft. 

I'm not really a Tesla bull, but I think evaluating by splitting into smaller pieces makes you lose the fact that all of these technologies being bundled into one company has value in itself. 

For consumer products it's the ol apple slogan ""it just works."" For enterprise IT products it's similar to how Microsoft is huge because they sell a product for literally everything and enterprises don't like buying from a new company if they can help it.

Great thanks for proving once again how racist and spiteful Europeans are.  I just said I was Chinese-American and you say that like my ethnicity is automatically bad.

&gt;They refused to censor the Xinjiang independence protests.

No you two-faced fake news clown, they refused to give information regarding terrorist attacks in Xinjiang, China to track down terrorist cell leaders.

This would be like if Facebook or Apple refused to give information regarding 9/11. They were a legitimate threat to national security.

Europe/US just bombs the Middle East by saying Iraq has nukes and openly comitting war crimes for 30 years.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I stated clearly China enables IP theft while the world doesn't.

It's called skills transfer. Are interns IP theft from companies? You sound like a salty ass ""They took our jobs"" kind of poor man.

&gt;Except they're actually taken to court and dragged through the process for stealing IP.

It's called skills transfer, which is what happens when you outsource. India is acquiring these skills as well.

Imagine if the world could take the UK/US to the world for 100 years of occupation.

Whatever poors, this is wsb. I just said there was a reason China banned FB/G and not MSFT. Then you started going on a rant about how China is the sole reason for the decline of West and not BRRRRRRR for the markets.

The people on the phone seemed fairly smart but not brilliant. Pay didn‚Äôt seem particularly good, and they clearly worked too many hours.

I‚Äôve been doing DD on this since the Sept filing that showed us RC was flirting with GME. Our biggest glimmer of hope was the Oct deal with MSFT. Hopefully, the board really is sitting somewhere, watching all of us dump money into it while jerking each other off, realizing that they can become sooo fucking wealthy if they just push back from the table a lil bit and give the kid a go at it.

3,2021-01-10,"Being institutionally held does help, but all it takes is for the hype to wear out and the % of sellers to be &gt; than the % of buyers. Elon is going to keep taking advantage of the inflated share price via equity offerings for as long as he can; he doesn't care about dilution.

All I'm saying is, do you. If you want to risk 100% of your worth on the small chance of doubling your money, that's your prerogative. Before you do though, [please read this](https://static.fmgsuite.com/media/documents/e0b44881-0a53-4bc0-8630-3a4e70b27c1a.pdf) (if anything because it's a great read). It's a client letter about a similar situation

It was written in 2000 and predicts how events will unfold over the next 15 years. One of the author's predictions was that Microsoft ($600bn market cap at the time) was grossly overvalued, despite being a great business, and that it would take 15 years for the underlying business to catch up to the estimates baked into the price.

After the Dotcom bubble burst, MSFT didn't reach $600bn in market cap again until 2016.

Like I said before, I just think you should consider the risks: you can either cash out now and keep **60%** of your money (taxes will suck) OR you can keep it in Tesla to capture potential upside, but risk **90%**. If you cashed out now and saw the share price double, would you beat yourself up? If you held onto your position and lost 90%, would you have regrets? Those are the questions that I'm asking.

Despite my original comment, this isn't financial advice. Just factors that you should consider before committing to put 100% of your worth on the line.

Large growth names comprise the majority of the indexes, and imo they won't perform very well and we'll see factor rotation into value and out of growth. Big names like AAPL MSFT etc. may not get hit as bad as, say, $ZM $PTON or $TSLA, but I'm of the belief that we see a large rotation into value. And once that inflation becomes a reality, Powell will raise interest rates, and the TINA effect will be no longer as we see money start to pour into bonds once again in the future (not near term, more like 2022+). The fact that long term rates are not only increasing since the GA dem sweep, but *accelerating*, is a cause for worry for names with bloated valuations. The tech bubble popped and the market got crushed while earnings continued to grow, price is not a function of growth rates, it's a function of valuations which are largely dependent on long term rates for those big growth companies.",huskythrowaway123123,wallstreetbets,3.0

THis is a very unpopular opinion, but I believe most of these congresspeople actually are wicked smart and stronlgy prefer that American companies dominate the world rather than uncontrollable foreign entities. They are not going to sabotage these companies' revenue opportunity, and the companies have very strong existing franchises which will be continue to be cash cows.

now, that said, nobody knows if/how long we'll be in a bubble, so Idk if 30+ p/e on the mega caps will be sustained (stimmy should help immensely compared to no stimmy)

I don't think their reputation has been hurt, in fact I think their initial identification and quick response regarding releasing hashes of their red-team toolkit (the compromised assets) and their private disclosure to all clients of Solarwinds was a good indicator followed by a public announcement at a later date about their full forensic and incident response activity is a good indicator of their skills and expertise. 

They're a bodyshop mostly, so the recruitment is probably because talent is leaving for remote work opportunities instead of FIFO forensic analysis.

MSFT already has a strong security arm and entrenched enterprise relationships, fire-eye can help provide retainer services and endpoint protection which MSFT doesn't have the engineers on staff for. It'd be an acquihire, not for the IP.

87,2021-02-01,"I'm so tired of people's posts getting downvoted to oblivion on this sub for asking a reasonable question. IMO, this is a reasonable take, and of course it gets downvoted. If you look at any other stock, MSFT, APPL, AMD, TSLA, AMC, etc., you will see the same pattern of 5 or so trades at 100 shares at a time. So, are they all being manipulated with a short ladder attack, too?

My personal opinion is that people frequently trade 100 shares because it is a nice, round number, and depending on the stock, 100 shares is usually within the reach of most retail investors. I seriously doubt this is proof of a short ladder attack. 

Regardless of anyone's position on GME's outlook, it is still worth hearing out the other side of the argument and making an informed decision, weighing the risk and trading according to your tolerance. I don't get why there isn't room for discussion.

These two folks joined the BoD to help Microvision close a strategic partnership, which include ""Sale and Merger"" of the company.

It's quite fucking obvious what Sumit Sharma, Microvision CEO is doing.

With the work they're doing with Microsoft, he's leveraging ELITE professionals in their field with ties in Ford and Google to outbid Microsoft. Microvision's work in the Hololens 2 (and subsequently IVAS, which will pull $2B in purchase orders for MSFT in the next 3 years) forces MSFT to stay in any kind of bidding war Sumit is trying to coordinate with the Multiple Tier 1 bidders interested in the company.",s2upid,wallstreetbets,109.0

137,2021-02-01,"I‚Äôm still maintaining that MC made a risk management error and let the short position they open up every year on GME continue. Due to their HF structure, they couldn‚Äôt get the fuck out. So they spent a metric fuckton of cash shorting the shit outta GME (shorts, not puts of which they have 500k.) That‚Äôs because an HF without sleeves in an SMA/UMA account has to follow certain rules for rebalancing and portfolio management. Thanks to COVID causing GME to accelerate their pivot, Melvin lost the momentum war. Read the post that one autist wrote on how Steve Cohen‚Äôs favorite play is momentum stall. That‚Äôs why MC doesn‚Äôt hedge with long/short; they just break momentum and ride the trend down. 

Now what happens if they‚Äôre picks are replicated across a bunch of hedgies, and everyone is leveraged to the tits? They‚Äôre frontrunning retail and making your money back on earnings and momentum plays. Citadel gets some theta, Melvin gets returns, and 30% goes to every institution that bought in. Wash, rinse, repeat. 

Well, that‚Äôs a fuckin problem now, because in their desperation at the start of the uptrend, they expended a lot of capital shorting. Shorting so much, in fact, that the shares weren‚Äôt there. For every underwriter and facilitator of the MSFT/GME deal, they started accruing more shares. Value investors were doing the same. Cohen comes in and destroys available shares. Now what? 

Welllll, what if MC‚Äôs models combined with Citadels frontrunning allowed a distributed copy cat position. All of Gabe‚Äôs picks are actually very solid, *except for the one that‚Äôs going to bankrupt the fucking firm*

I have no doubt they have been closing when they can. However, how many time‚Äôs did Cohen share these plays with peeps at idea dinners and meetings? Shit, get a big enough bank to underwrite, you could legit sell Melvin Capital‚Äôs model and strat with accompanying positions as a type of short aggregate option bundle. 

Now everyone in their Skype favorites is leveraged to the tits and each one is in it for way too much fuckin money. Meanwhile, firms with their own clearing houses that are massively pissed off about losing commission trading are accruing shares of the counterparty‚Äôs weakest link. 

This shit wasn‚Äôt supposed to pop off yet, but here it is, thanks to retail getting the tip from DFV and a bunch of others that took the time to do the one thing that would have saved Gabe Plotkin when he put this portfolio together earlier this year during rebalancing: reading the fucking balance sheet.",Cquintessential,wallstreetbets,137.0

48,2021-02-02,"the gme is over - change my mind

full disclosure, I own zero shares of GME (never have). I'm not a regular in this sub but I've given this gme a lot of thought...

there were 3 decent bullish catalysts in late 2020 (Ryan Cohen and 2 others from Chewy step into GME's board, new console cycles via new PS5 &amp; Xbox releases, deal with MSFT to earn a share of Xbox digital revenues) also the stock was carelessly over-shorted... so the planets were well lined up for this to work

I think the next shoe to drop is for GME's bankers to recommend an equity offering... if the market is going to give them such a valuation, might as well get some cash in and see about some material investments (their bankers will help them there too)

the trouble will be gauging the depth of the market (where the offering is priced to garner sufficient investor interest such that all the offered shares are sold); this will be particularly relevant in CME's case. CME will want a bought deal (the bank wears the risk); once the mandate is given (and before the deal is announced), the lead banker/bookrunner will have an incentive to set up shorts above or close to the offering price (and implicitly closing those shorts upon buying the offering)

I also wonder if further GMEs are up now that big short funds are paying for Reddit monitoring services... your opponent is now constantly looking over your shoulder

I think there might still be some blood to squeeze out of GME but timing will be key

I was trading in 2008. Any monkey was making money trading stocks. You didn't need to baghold shit, just close your eye, pick a stock, set your limit at 15-20% return and jump into your next play. Turned $2k (every penny I got from an internship) into $14k in a matter of 3 months. That's probably when I should've quit since I could've just kept all my stocks in that portfolio that would be worth somewhere close to $250k at this point (AMD/NVDA/MSFT/AAPL). But instead I got into Penny's and joined pump and dump schemes that mirror EXACTLY what the GME thread looks like right now. Lost everything.

And fuck off with these zoomers who think 2008 was 50 years ago. I was trading on Scottrade @ $7 a trade on my phone (a Sidekick on edge because you don't need that much data to load the Scottrade site). When I started making real money, I switched over to the desktop app that had live trading info (pretty much what ToS looks like now since they bought out ST).

The hedgefunds didn't cause that. They realized that and shorted GME positions. Which was a logical and correct move. (They just got too greedy, way overdid it and got a heavy slap for it, but that's a different story.)

The point is: Gamestop is a very bad long term invest. There are much more promising one's. Just taking AMZN, MSFT or more risky (what I'm doing currently): CDXS. About everything would make more sense than GME, BB, NOK or AMC... Those are all dead.

Salesforce's acquisitions aren't a result of trying to pump revenue on the bottomline, it's a combination of moving into adjacent marketspace without R&amp;D investment, and staying competitive with competing offers.

Your Slack example is a perfect example.  Their valuation was $25B, and you need to pay a premium in order to acquire a company.  And the play wasn't a result of trying to get Slack's revenue or profit.  Microsoft has been pushing Dynamics *hard* as part of the O365 licensing model.  That's a direct competitor to SFDC.  And MSFT's message that their sales org is pushing is ""We hit all of your software needs with one license.""  The biggest driver of upsales on O365 are Dynamics and Teams.  Bundling CRM and UCaaS is a gamechanger, and has been wildly successful for them.

SFDC needed to be able to compete with that bundling.  So they bought the biggest competitor to Teams.  And they'll bundle it with SFDC licenses.

Tableau is a similar purchase.  BI is a huge play right now, and *also* a feature that MSFT is bundling with O365.  Adding Tableau into the fold allows SFDC to directly compete with MSFT on that front, too.

46,2021-03-04,"the analogy comparing a toaster to a fighter jet is just wrong in that context. 

to use the toaster analogy, you would have to stay in the construct of ""cooking"" so to speak.   
with self improving  and self teaching / learning AI (which already exists) you start with something that doesn¬¥tr even know what a toast is, but giving all ingredients and tools.   
and rather sooner than later you end up with a 5 star michelin chef AI without ever  teaching the AI all the intricacies of cooking. it will teach itself and learn it all, just because it understood and built upon the basic principles. it all does this  on scale of speed impossible to match for any human. 

(sidenote: I doubt cooking will ever be the area AI will be pretty good at, but the example brings the point across). 

AI already can learn writing, reading, image recognition etc.

&amp;#x200B;

only because the current publicly available version of google translator is bad, does not mean AI is not worth the effort. a coouple of years ago, MSFT had a key note presentation where AI was able to translate chinese into english. in real time. speech to speech. 

also:  
using the evolution of human society and the time that was needed to  achieve this evolution and actually comparing this to improvement speeds of AI is ... ""problematic"" as speeds of development is ever increasing, no matter the topic. 

 it took but only a couple of years (relatively) to go from the first concept of flight to planes much that can reach the upper amtosphere. 

the very first programmable computer was built in 1941. now we have supercomputers with 415.5 petaflops. thats less than 100 years.   
and humans had to solve countless limitations during this time. yet development speeds keep improving. 

MuZero, a learning algorithm based on AlphZero, played / learned games without ever being taught the rules. 

Alphazero ""learned"" chess by playing it against itself for 24  hours. 

AlphaGo learned Go (a much more complex problem mathermatically than Chess)  in 3 hours.

* GameStop(GME) builds on Monday's 40% surge

* Indexes up: Dow 0.74%, S&amp;P 2.01%, Nasdaq 4.10% (Updates prices, adds analyst comment)

By Herbert Lash and Karen Pierog

March 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks advanced on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq jumping about 4% to recoup its losses from the previous session, as U.S. bond yields retreated and investors scooped up battered technology stocks.

Tesla Inc (TSLA) jumped about 19%, while Apple Inc(AAPL) , Amazon.com Inc(AMZN) and Microsoft Corp(MSFT) gained between 3.3% and 4.4% after sharp losses in recent weeks as a rise in yields raised concerns over their high valuations.

News that a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package was nearing final approval sparked a spike in yields on Monday, pushing the tech-heavy Nasdaq to end more than 10% below its Feb. 12 closing high, confirming a correction for the index.

U.S. 10-year Treasury note yields eased to as low as 1.523% after hovering near 13-month highs of 1.613% in the prior session. Longer-dated yields have jumped over the last month as investors price in a faster-than-expected economic rebound and higher inflation.

The market is adjusting to the new level in interest rates, said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York. Companies whose products and services are in demand when the economy is doing well, known as cyclicals, and small-cap stocks will outperform this year, she said. Tech will end the year higher but not be the leader as it was in the past year's rally.

""Today the 10-year is down a bit, and that takes pressure off valuations, so tech is performing well,"" Hooper said. ""The market is just about getting comfortable at this level of rates.""

Rising interest rates disproportionately hurt high-growth tech companies because they are valued on earnings expected years into the future rather than profits earned in the short term.

""Potential headwind for the market is (when) interest rates rise further from this point over the short period ... since they have risen too fast in too little time,"" said Michael Sheldon, chief investment officer at RDM Financial in Westport, Connecticut.

By 2:50 p.m. ET (1950 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 234.05 points, or 0.74%, to 32,036.49, the S&amp;P 500 gained 76.96 points, or 2.01%, to 3,898.31 and the Nasdaq Composite added 517.57 points, or 4.1%, to 13,126.73.

The rise in Treasury yields has accelerated a rotation from ""stay-at-home"" winners to stocks primed to benefit from an economic reopening, setting the blue-chip Dow on pace to end at a record high on Tuesday.

While the Russell 2000 growth index jumped over 3.2% on Tuesday, compared to a 0.7% rise in Russell 2000 value index , it has sharply underperformed its value counterpart since the start of the month.

Shares of Tesla surged 19% on Tuesday, rebounding from a deep sell-off and putting the automaker on track for its largest one-day gain in nearly eight years.

The global economic outlook has brightened as vaccine rollouts gain speed and the United States launches a massive new stimulus package, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development said, hiking its 2021 growth forecasts.

The Democrat-controlled U.S. House of Representatives will take up the relief bill on Wednesday, with the chamber's expected approval leading to President Joe Biden's signing the legislation into law later this week.

The bank index dropped 0.39% after vaulting to a new 14-year peak. Economy-linked financials, materials and industrials hovered near record highs.

GameStop (GME) was up 22%, building on Monday's rise of over 40% on the video retailer's e-commerce strategy and speculation that small investors will pour stimulus checks into markets.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.31-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.58-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&amp;P 500 posted 37 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 214 new highs and 15 new lows.

By Shashank Nayar and Medha Singh

March 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks advanced on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq jumping over 3% to recoup its losses in the previous session as U.S. bond yields retreated and investors picked up battered technology stocks.

Among the biggest boosts to the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq were Tesla Inc(TSLA), Apple Inc(AAPL), Amazon.com Inc(AMZN), Facebook Inc(FB) and Microsoft Corp(MSFT) jumped between 2.4% and 7.2% after sharp losses in recent weeks as a rise in yields raised concerns over their high valuations.

Signs that a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package was closing in on final approval sparked a spike in yields on Monday, pushing the tech-heavy Nasdaq to end more than 10% below its Feb. 12 closing high that confirmed a correction.

U.S. 10-year Treasury bond yields eased to 1.54% after hovering near 13-month highs of 1.613% in the prior session. Longer-dated yields have jumped over the last month as investors price in a faster-than-expected economic rebound and higher inflation.

Higher yields can weigh even more on tech and growth stocks with lofty valuations, as they threaten to erode the value of their longer-term cash flows.

""Tech stocks are overdue for some kind of bounce after the downfall they have had so far with most investor maintaining a positive outlook (on them) in the medium to longer term,"" said Michael Sheldon, chief investment officer at RDM Financial in Westport, Connecticut.

""Potential headwind for the market is if interest rates rise further from this point over the short period... since they have risen too fast in too little time.""

At 9:59 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 168.01 points, or 0.53%, to 31,970.45, the S&amp;P 500 gained 57.06 points, or 1.49%, to 3,878.41 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 399.55 points, or 3.17%, to 13,008.71.

The rise in yields has accelerated a rotation from ""stay-at-home"" winners to stocks primed to benefit from an economic reopening, helping the blue-chip Dow hit an intraday record high on Monday.

The global economic outlook has brightened as vaccine rollouts gain speed and the United States launches a massive new stimulus package, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said, hiking its 2021 growth forecasts.

The U.S. House of Representatives could approve the relief bill as early as Tuesday, with a vote allowing the Democratic president to sign the legislation into law later this week.

Also, MSFT customer service is great but Sony fucking sucks, it's easier for me to go to EB and argue for a refund on trash products than with Sony chat.

19,2021-03-10,"March 10 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks jumped on Wednesday with the Dow hitting a record high, as data showed underlying consumer prices remained tepid in February, easing concerns about a spike in inflation.

The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield slipped from its session highs as data showed core consumer prices index, which excludes volatile items such as food and energy, rose less than expected last month.

Focus is on an auction of U.S. 10-year and 30-year debt later in the day for clues to where yields in the recently volatile market may be headed.

""Expectations for near-term inflation to rise is going to remain due to the huge public borrowings, but the tame inflation data that has come today would definitely drive some optimism among investors,"" said Arthur Weise, chief investment officer at Kingsland Growth Advisors in New York.

Accelerated vaccine rollouts and a new hefty round of fiscal stimulus on the horizon have raised bets on higher inflation, triggering a sharp rise in Treasury yields that knocked off the tech-heavy Nasdaq about 7% from its Feb. 12 record closing high.

The United States plans to double its order of the single-shot Johnson &amp; Johnson(JNJ) coronavirus vaccine, procuring an additional 100 million doses, a White House official said on Wednesday.

The Nasdaq extended gains after logging its best one-day percentage jump in four months on Tuesday, helped by a near 20% jump in Tesla Inc's(TSLA) shares as investors picked up momentum stocks that had recently taken a beating due to higher yields.

Amazon.com Inc (AMZN), Microsoft Corp(MSFT) and Tesla extended gains by 0.8% and 4% from the previous session, while economy-linked industrial and financial stocks jumped more than 1% each.

The chunk of a $1.9 trillion relief aid, which is on track to be signed into law later this week, is poised to end up in the stock market and could provide a boost for GameStop(GME) and other stocks popular among retail investors active in online social media forums.

Shares of GameStop(GME) jumped another 19%, setting the videogame retailer on track for its longest streak of daily gains in six months and extending a rally that has already doubled the company's market value.

Among other ""meme"" stocks, Koss Corp(KOSS) and AMC Entertainment(AMC) climbed 52% and 14%.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4.2-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 4.1-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

By Medha Singh and Shashank Nayar

March 10 (Reuters) - Major U.S. stock indexes were set to open higher on Wednesday after data showed underlying consumer prices remained tepid in February, easing concerns about a spike in inflation as an economic recovery gathers momentum.

The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield ticked lower as data showed core consumer prices index inflation rose less than expected as demand for services including airline travel gradually picked up.

Focus is on an auction of U.S. 10-year and 30-year debt later in the day for clues to where yields in the recently volatile market may be headed.

""Expectations for near-term inflation to rise is going to remain due to the huge public borrowings, but the tame inflation data that has come today would definitely drive some optimism among investors,"" said Arthur Weise, chief investment officer at Kingsland Growth Advisors in New York.

At 8:52 a.m. ET, Dow E-minis were up 176 points, or 0.55%, S&amp;P 500 E-minis were up 15.5 points, or 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 E-minis were up 75.5 points, or 0.59%.

Accelerated vaccine rollouts and a new hefty round of fiscal stimulus on the horizon have raised bets on higher inflation, triggering a sharp rise in Treasury yields that knocked off the tech-heavy Nasdaq about 7% from its Feb. 12 record closing high. The Nasdaq logged its best one-day percentage jump in four months on Tuesday, helped by a near 20% jump in Tesla Inc's(TSLA) shares as investors picked up momentum stocks that had recently taken a beating due to higher yields.

Apple Inc (AAPL), Amazon.com Inc(AMZN) and Microsoft Corp(MSFT) extended gains slightly from the previous session, while economy-linked industrial and bank stocks including Boeing Co(BA), Morgan Stanley(MS) and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co(JPM) also added between 0.8% and 1.2%.

The chunk of a $1.9 trillion relief aid, which is on track to be signed into law later this week, is poised to end up in the stock market and could provide a boost for GameStop(GME) and other stocks popular among retail investors active in online social media forums.

Shares of GameStop(GME) jumped another 12%, setting the videogame retailer on track for its longest streak of daily gains in six months and extending a rally that has already doubled the company's market value.

Among other ""meme"" stocks, Koss Corp(KOSS) and AMC Entertainment(AMC) climbed 44% and 7.4%. (Reporting by Medha Singh and Shashank Nayar in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel)",ionized_fallout,wallstreetbets,24.0

The top-weighted technology sector (+1.9%) is the best performer in the early going while four other groups also show gains of 1.0% or more.

Key factors driving today's performance include:

* Leadership from high-beta chipmakers. The PHLX Semiconductor Index (+3.3%) has returned into positive territory for the week thanks to gains in all 30 components. The group is now up 1.9% for the week versus a 3.2% week-to-date gain in the Nasdaq (+2.0%). *South China Morning Post* reported overnight that the U.S. and China established a working group aimed at ""easing export controls"" and ""improving supply chain security.""
* Strong showing from the largest components by weight. **Apple** (**AAPL** 122.05, +2.07, +1.7%), **Microsoft** (**MSFT** 236.54, +4.12, +1.8%), and **Visa** (**V** 226.79, +3.62, +1.6%) are all up more than 1.0%.

**Notable movers:**

* **Qorvo** (**QRVO** 175.15, +9.78, +5.9%): best performer in the sector, rallying back above its 50-day moving average (174.20).
* **ServiceNow** (**NOW** 498.88, +24.88, +5.3%): reclaiming its 200-day moving average (485.36).
* **Skyworks** (**SWKS** 174.48, +6.82, +4.1%): rising back above its 50-day moving average (171.42).
* **AMD** (**AMD** 79.96, +2.44, +3.2%): rising back above its 200-day moving average (78.77).
* **NVIDIA** (**NVDA** 515.88, +17.15, +3.4%): trading near yesterday's high.
* **PayPal** (**PYPL** 250.78, +8.71, +3.6%): rising toward its 50-day moving average (254.04).
* **Fortinet** (**FTNT** 185.41, +4.95, +2.7%): rallying to a fresh record high.

Russian is about to attack Ukraine, and this AR tech will likely be used there in proxy from the U.S./U.N. side, which is probably why MSFT disclosed it ahead of time, so people aren't surprised when it's mentioned as the supplier of the killer drone strike goggles  


I found all this because I'm tits deep in 4/16 MSFT $250 calls. This MVIS company is the primary component and patent supplier for the AR device that MSFT just sold $22B worth of to the U.S. military two days ago, so I picked up their calls as well.

MVIS is on a verge of a breakthrough announcement in not one, not two, but three different verticals:
1. LiDAR + EV cooperation with either MSFT/AAPL/or WVAGY
2. Giant, and I mean giant, patent moat that they are sitting on, as it‚Äôs gaining value, in billions (think Motorola being bought by Google for their patent moat)
3. The $22 billion dollar (just the initial leg of this contract, probably hundreds of billions when all said and done, once other branches and UN follows suit, like they‚Äôve done in the past) with MSFT for the IVAS (augmented reality unmanned drone control goggles, or simply - remote digits vision goggles)

The last point happened just two days ago, and will be officially confirmed only next week, while the other 2 points are having announcements in Mid April.

So why a hit piece based on ‚Äúhistorical averages‚Äù? Why now?

This is a 5x bagger if you play straight stocks, and possible breakout 500x bagger if you know what you are doing with debit call spreads.

71,2021-04-05,"**TL;DR:** TSLA short interest is not 5% as reported, but 26% due to float contraction &amp; options bets, making the stock susceptible to a short squeeze.

DD:

----

- The 5.5% TSLA equity short interest of 44m shares [1] is only part of the ""true"", effective TSLA short interest: there's 2.6 million put option contracts open right now [2], a significant part of which are in the money, which, on a ~20% rally due to record Q1 results, combined with 2.6 million open calls, have the delta hedging effect equivalent to another ~100m shares short covered ...
- The pro-forma float of TSLA is 771m shares [2] - but at least ~130m of that is locked up by S&amp;P 500 index funds, ~90m by options market makers for current delta hedging requirements: 220m shares or 28% of the float is already locked up today - effective float is 551m shares or lower.
- Due to TSLA's +1,000% rally in 2020 options market makers are net long TSLA by tens of millions of shares - so the delta hedging effect of put contracts doesn't show up in the regular short interest as it normally does for other names. Much of the effective short interest is ""hidden"" by this temporary artifact.
- So if we plug these numbers in: with TSLA starting at $661 if we have a major rally due to the Q1 results (TSLA already up +7% today) then we have 44m shares equity short and market makers lock up another ~100m shares during the rally just to delta-hedge the millions of puts and millions of calls.
- The delta hedging by market makers is anti-dilutive, just like short covering: it removes shares from the effective float. Anti-dilutive buy-to-cover is much stronger buying pressure than the typical trader-to-trader buying, because it contracts the float. 
- So should most Tesla shorts want to cover (not all: some are price insensitive hedges), they have to compete with the delta hedging of market makers (and regular bullish buyers): there's a combined buying of 144m shares on a 20% move, against an effective float of 551m shares. **That's an effective short interest of 26%.**
- A short interest of 26% for a low-float megacap like TSLA is excessively high compared to other megacaps: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT and GOOG short interest is all below 1%, and their options open interests are an order of magnitude smaller than that of TSLA. [4]  [5]


I.e. the Tesla shorting that drive the price down from the $900 ATH to the current $661 is an ***excessively*** overcrowded short trade, with over $30b value at risk - which they'd want to cover much faster than any GME short position.

So a significant TSLA ""synthetic short squeeze"" is possible IMO, driven in part by excessive short options bets.

Should after the record quarter TSLA rally beyond $900 price levels to new ATHs, then all bets are off.

46,2021-04-08,"If you truly understand what PLTR does, that's great.  Then you should also understand the most important basic point which is that PLTR cannot instantly duplicate their services to each and every account.  They need to customize, build a team account officers and staff. They'll need to modify, massage, filter each of their clients database differently. MSFT can duplicate their core OS once they finished writing code for it.  So can Facebook.  I'm simplifying here, but essentially this basic digital multipiicity enables scalability.  Scalabilty works with lithography on top of seminconductor. Scalability works on digital copy duplication with software, apps, gaming.  If you truly understand PLTR, it's likely you'll likely come to realization scalability doesn't really apply to them.  Too much customization, servicing is involved.",wallstreetwhiskers,wallstreetbets,46.0

AWS has Route53 and Cloudfront and have been taking lots of marketshare from cloudflare of late.  I can anecdotally confirm from my tech peers.  Also many large companies prefer one vendor and AWS is also cheaper to boot.

34,2021-05-04,"From the comments, it doesn't look like they think it was a good play.   


WSB is not known for backing GOOD plays either though so take it with a grain of salt.   


1) Your buy-in price isn't bad. $53.64 is already profitable today ($54 at time of post).   


2)You are \~33$ below ATH, which does give you visible upside.   


3)It is doubtful Twitter would fall too much lower quickly from where it is at.   


Do I think this is a good play? No.   


However, it is not the worst one I have seen so far. Taking a 2nd mortgage on your house (if true) for Twitter is pretty stupid BUT you bought shares and not options so you will be able to save value (probably).   


Honestly, there are WAY better plays out there for a YOLO. TWTR really hasn't done much since debut, their PPC is not as cost-effective as rival platforms, and companies are worried about the toxic content so are wary of advertising.   


In the end, it is not as bad as the forum comments would make it out to be.   


If I were to YOLO (and I do) I would go for something like the Proterra/Arclight merger (buy shares but 6/18 call options are for the REAL tendies.....and losses).   


Even a play on UWMC (or RKT if you are a RKT bro).

**True Velocity**

**Dry &amp; Drab overview:**
&gt; True Velocity is an advanced technology and composite manufacturing company focused on revolutionizing the ammunition industry. Based in Garland, Texas, True Velocity has more than 250 patents pending or issued on its products, technology, and manufacturing processes. The company‚Äôs 75 employees have more than 200 years of combined military service and are experts in manufacturing, engineering, and quality control.

&gt; True Velocity is on a mission to produce the best ammunition in the world. The proprietary True Velocity composite cartridge provides significant advantages over traditional brass-cased ammunition and gives end users unmatched accuracy, repeatability, and reliability, all in a lightweight package.

&gt; Composite cartridges are a step toward the future of self-defense, hunting, and sport shooting and are a critical component of force modernization for defense agencies worldwide. At 30 percent lighter than traditional brass-cased cartridges, True Velocity composite-cased ammunition provide significant shipping and logistical cost savings, while also delivering improved accuracy, enhanced efficiency and unprecedented consistency. 

&gt; All True Velocity products are manufactured in the U.S. in a state-of-the-art 66,000-square-foot facility and are currently available to public agencies, with consumer products available soon.

&gt; Founded in 2010, True Velocity is delivering real innovation to the ammunition industry through proprietary processes, superior services, and unmatched products. True Velocity is a finalist in the Next Generation Squad Weapons program, which represents the U.S. Army‚Äôs most significant small arms program in decades, and has been added to the shortlist for the Australian Defense Force‚Äôs LAND 159 Lethality System Project procurement process. A trailblazer in the ammunition industry, True Velocity is also a member of the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers‚Äô Institute, helping determine the standards for composite cartridges and innovative ammunition solutions that wish to be accepted into the marketplace.

&gt; True Velocity is not just an ammunition manufacturer. We are a team of problem-solvers thinking differently about a centuries-old product, applying new technologies and pushing an industry forward. [Source](https://www.tvammo.com/about)

* Currently private (damnit). . . would love to see them go public.

* True Velocity's polymer-cased ammo has the potential to be a game changer (when looking at it from a defense lens, not so much from a recreational lens) since it has a 40% weight reduction when compared to traditional brass-cased ammo. True Velocity's CEO, Kevin Boscamp, told a Pentagon officer, ""I'll give you all the ammo you want, just give me 40% of your transportation savings.""

* True Velocity teamed up with Lonestar Future Weapons and General Dynamics to bid on the Army's Next Generation Squad Weapons (NGSW) contract to replace the M249 Saw used as Army's standard assault weapon. Sig Sauer and Textron are also bidding on this with their ""hybrid"" ammo and ""cased telescope"" ammo, respectively. 





**Disclosers**

* Its taken me about two weeks to evaluate all these companies and write this lengthy post. Unfortunately, life got in the way and I was not able to complete it prior to the currently ongoing earnings season; so, any analysis of recently posted (May 2021) earnings is not included.

**American Outdoor Brands - AOUT**

**Dry &amp; Drab overview of AOUT:** American Outdoor Brands, Inc. provides outdoor products and accessories for rugged outdoor enthusiasts in the United States and internationally. The company offers hunting, fishing, camping, shooting, and personal security and defense products. Its products include shooting supplies, rests, vaults, and other related accessories; premium sportsmen knives and tools for fishing and hunting; land management tools for hunting preparedness; harvesting products for post-hunt or post-fishing activities; electro-optical devices comprising hunting optics, firearm aiming devices, flashlights, and laser grips; reloading, gunsmithing, and firearm cleaning supplies; and survival, camping, and emergency preparedness products. The company sells its products through e-commerce and traditional distribution channels under the Marksman, Defender, Harvester, and Adventure brand lanes. American Outdoor Brands, Inc. was incorporated in 2020 and is headquartered in Columbia, Missouri. [Source](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/AOUT/)

* Conglomerate of multiple business in the outdoor industry.

* Spin off from Smith &amp; Wesson (SWBI).

* AOUT does not sell firearms--IIRC this is why the AOUT-SWBI split was performed--the items most associated with firearms and/or the defense industry it sells are through Crimson Trace (scopes, red dot, lasers), Frankford Arsenal (reloading), Caldwell (ear protection, range gear, targets), and Tipton (gun cleaning and maintenance). Operates in the outdoor industry through Uncle Henry, Old Timer, and Schrade (knives), Meat! (meat processing), UST (camping supplies such as tents, sleeping bags, cookware, etc.), Bubba (fisherman‚Äôs gear for processing), among others. 

* Few publicly traded competitors in this outdoor recreational sector; Great American Outdoors Group owns Bass Pro Shops, Cabela's and recently acquired the previously publicly traded Sportsman's Warehouse. The only publicly traded competitors in this broad, overarching recreational category that I can think of are Vista Outdoors (VSTO), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Gander Mountain (MM), and Academy Sports &amp; Outdoors (ASO).

**Vista Outdoors - VSTO**

**Dry &amp; Drab overview of VSTO:** Vista Outdoor Inc. designs, manufactures, and markets various consumer products in the outdoor sports and recreation markets in the United States and internationally. It has a portfolio of brands that provides consumers with a range of products for individual outdoor recreational pursuits. The company operates through two segments, Shooting Sports and Outdoor Products. The Shooting Sports segment offers ammunition products, including centerfire ammunition, rimfire ammunition, shotshell ammunition, and reloading components; hunting accessories comprising high-performance hunting arrows, game calls, hunting blinds, game cameras, decoys, and optics products; and shooting accessories, such as reloading equipment, clay targets, and premium gun care products, as well as holsters, duty gear, bags, and packs. The Outdoor Products segment offers sports protection products that include helmets, goggles, and accessories for cycling, snow sports, action sports, and powersports; outdoor cooking products, such as grills and stoves; golf products, which comprise laser rangefinders and other golf technology products; and hydration products, including hydration packs and water bottles. The company sells its products to outdoor enthusiasts, hunters, recreational shooters, athletes, law enforcement, and military professionals through various mass, specialty, and independent retailers and distributors, as well as directly to consumers through brand's website and third party e-tail websites. Vista Outdoor Inc. was incorporated in 2014 and is headquartered in Anoka, Minnesota. [Source](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/VSTO/) 

* Large conglomerate of multiple business in the outdoor industry.

* VSTO does not sell firearms, the items most associated with firearms and/or the defense industry it sells are through Alliant Powder (smokeless powder), CCI (ammo and primers), Hevi-Shot (shotgun ammo), Federal (ammo and reloading supplies), Remington (ammo), Speer (ammo and reloading supplies), Bushnell (scopes and optics), and RCBS (reloading tools). Operates in the outdoor industry through Bell (helmets), Blackburn (bike gear), Krash (kids helmets and scooters), Copilot (child bike carriers), Camelback (hydration), Bushnell Golf (really?), Eagle Industries (for the Gravy Seals amongst us), Primos (hunting gear), among others. 

* Few publicly traded competitors in this outdoor recreational sector; Great American Outdoors Group owns Bass Pro Shops, Cabela's and recently acquired the previously publicly traded Sportsman's Warehouse. The only publicly traded competitors in this broad, overarching recreational category that I can think of are American Outdoor Brands (AOUT), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Gander Mountain (MM), and Academy Sports &amp; Outdoors (ASO).

* Divested of it‚Äôs gun manufacturing subsidiaries, Savage Arms and Stevens, in 2019; so VSTO does not sell firearms. 

* Through bankruptcy proceedings in October 2020, VSTO will acquire Remington Arm‚Äôs ammunition manufacturing facility in Arkansas, and related intellectual property, including the Remington brand and trademarks, for $81.4 million.

* Expect reactive stock moves to Federal rhetoric and legislature surrounding guns and ammo.

* Expect reactive stock moves to Federal elections (POTUS and Congress).

* Due to my experience in the firearms and outdoor industry and being fully aware of what's been happening the last 12-18 months within these sectors, I question their ability to sustain such dramatic growth related to ammunition and reloading components beyond calendar year 2021. 


**Microsoft - MSFT**

MSFT isn‚Äôt that into aerospace and defense, but I‚Äôm including them because of the following notable contracts. 

**Dry &amp; Drab overview of MSFT:** Seriously!? If you're really asking then there's a tree stump out in the holler with a higher IQ.

* $10B JEDI (Joint Enterprise Defense Initiative) contract - intended to provide the government with a cloud computing platform that would sit atop all other cloud deployments at the DoD and provide a general-purpose cloud environment; smaller, specific clouds ‚Äî what the government called ‚Äúfit for purpose‚Äù clouds ‚Äî were only to be utilized on an as-needed basis. Contract has been riddled with controversy and litigation due to protests by Amazon and Oracle. DoD has taken actions that indicates that it may scrap the whole JEDI project due to delays as a result of protests and litigation. 

* $22B HoloLens contract over 10-years -  augmented reality headset for Army.

**Uranium**

Now not everyone is in big data platforms - some just want basic SQL right?

Azure SQL db is also a nightmare - it doesn't scale disk, which is a lot of workload for everything that isn't transactional.

OK so what about SQL on a VM like the old days?
Complicated as fuck licensing models for SQL on a VM mean that not even Microsoft can sort it out. We have like 100 SQL servers which should be like millions of dollars for Microsoft - but the servers change sizes often so how the fuck can we license them per core?! So we just did what any shop would do - reached out to Microsoft support and requested sales teams to look at our environment and quote us on what we need. This was followed by an official Microsoft audit where the auditors were so confused they just basically took a giant spreadsheet from us, looked at it, and said - yep everything seems in line here!

Did Gates acquire so much farm land to ultimately farm children? I mean, an all child diet requires a lot of farmland to support the mothers and their children. Do you think he uses breastmilk butter to oil the skillet? Does he personally breed them or were his biotech stakes to fund synthetic artificial insemination with the actual end goal of GMO baby meat (a whole food source). 

So many questions the media just don't have answers to. 

The investment answer is buy farmland since Bill clearly wants to commercialize the sale of baby meat for billionaires. The billionaire market is just now becomming large enough thanks to economic inequality and COVID. It's perfect. Land mortgages offer significant leverage with government backed financing. The monthly premiums are a bitch but you can hedge that with cannabis and beans. Those two crops are prime baby making feedstock. Gates will swoop in and 10X your money.

16,2021-06-09,"Thanks for the comment! 

I guess for background, I‚Äôm 24 and a half, just finished grad school in stats, and I‚Äôm making $65k/year (living with my parents rn but will be moving back to the RTP for work in late July). Before taxes, every two weeks I‚Äôll be making about $2700. Thank god I have no debt (love my parents so much ‚ù§Ô∏è), but my current portfolio is this:

100 shares of CRSP
15 shares of AMC
10 shares of WISH
10 shares of CLOV

The 100 shares of CRSP I really don‚Äôt want to touch. I originally had 50 shares of MSFT at around $245 at its peak (then), sold it all for GME, diamond handed it, and then sold it for a slight loss at $90/share (bought in around $94/share). Used that money to buy CRSP because I felt like an idiot with my GME purchase, thinking it wouldn‚Äôt ever spike again. Also, like an idiot, while I was still living with my parents back home in Ohio, I was still on my lease back in NC and gambled $2500 (about 6 months worth of rent) in the market as well and lost about $1900 leaving me with just south of 2 months worth of rent. 

I‚Äôve learned my lessons for sure, and I‚Äôm happy that I put money into CLOV and WISH yesterday, and I‚Äôm optimistic about AMC, but my goal is 

100 shares of BEAM, 
100 shares of FATE, 
100 shares of NTLA, 
25 shares of NVDA, 
25 shares of TSLA, 
50 shares of AMD, 
50 shares of AAPL, 
50 shares of MSFT, and 
50 shares of AI. 

That said, I really want to get into purchasing calls, I just don‚Äôt really know how to. I use TD Ameritrade and I just want to make sure I‚Äôm doing it right and be super careful. I definitely have opinions about what prices certain stocks will be at by some time point I think, I just don‚Äôt know how to trade calls on those. I also don‚Äôt really know what ‚Äútheta‚Äù is so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not in the options game. I see so many people making big bucks off it though. I don‚Äôt know the math/logistics of how that works but damn, I want my piece.

There are many companies that are quite new and in relatively new sectors like vegan food and EVs. Anything can happen with stocks like that, some of these new companies aren't even profitable yet.

If you did well last year I'd recommend putting a good chunk of that money into low risk finds and ETFs, or go in blue chip stocks like MSFT and AMZN. Then speculate with smaller amounts of money.

That's just me though, I also started a year ago and made a lot of mistakes, I'm only up about 20% overall in a year which normally would be great but last year stocks came back up so fast I should've done much better.

19,2021-06-11,"Most blue chips have very low volatility to begin with, so it's really not as much about the volatility so much as the fundamentals and valuation. Sure, there is always an element of volatility given a period of time until expiration, but selling MSFT 12 months out for a 3% premium is just capturing some yield/premium on something that I don't think is going down and that I'd be fine to own it in the event it does for some reason.  

Likewise, if I buy a put on the SP500, I'm not betting on increased volatility, I'm betting on an actual material decline in fundamentals by a given date, possibly even a slow one.

You can have very low implied volatility, maintain low volatility, and still see substantial price movement over a 12 month period as fundamentals simply change. These are the sort of options I buy/sell. I really don't trade options based on short-term volatility effecting the underlying price of the option. I hold them all like 95% to expiration, maybe ditching it a bit early for tax year purposes or if the risk/reward seems pointless (option already lost 99% of it's value, no reason to hold it for a black swan).",uiuyiuyo,wallstreetbets,19.0

If you head over to thetagang, hundreds of people selling CCs when amc was in the $11-14 range got all their stock assigned and didn't make any profit past amc going over $14+. We need to avoid this at all costs.

As for other stocks i plan on wheeling a few tickers such as amd, msft, fb and dkng after amc is done with.

The agency said it plans to solicit proposals from both Amazon and Microsoft for the contract, adding that they are the only cloud service providers that can meet its needs. But, it added, it will continue to do market research to see if others could also meet its specifications.

Ie.  Imagine if an oil company stock didn‚Äôt go up more, if oil rose from $50 to $300. 


So, something is weird, but it should work. 


I hold some safer stuff in shares but only because the collateral hit is minor and use that sell options. 


Use OptionStrat. It‚Äôs amazing. Tons of good ideas. Made bucket loads doing that. $80k at least directly from there. 


Mostly good for modeling out call spreads, and neutral strategies. They oddly work very well in high IV when they shouldn‚Äôt. If you buy when IV is high, then the spread is huge, and safely huge, so you are relatively safe. 


Don‚Äôt do covered calls. It is a retarded move. 


Always hold some cash back in reserve. You‚Äôll know when to deploy it. 


People making posts not comments are people looking to pump their position.  They only make a post after they‚Äôve created their position or are bag holding. 


Sort wsb by new and if you have the capital, buy OTM calls for 45-60 days out if it‚Äôs a good play. If it‚Äôs not as good buy shorter dates ones because cheaper. Never buy ATM or ITM. Useless. You want extrinsic value to catapult your positions up. 


If you‚Äôre not sure about calls then. Just buy whatever is being pumped. Ride the wave. Set a trailing stop and let it pull you out with profit every time. Even if you only net on average 1-2% a day, when you compound that over a year it‚Äôs huge. Trailing stops are amazing. 


Bracket orders are cool too if you are going into volatile trading. 


You can use them and make good profits when trading a new pump in the first 15min of market open. Made many dollars there. AMC CLOV WISH most recently.

Part two: to avoid being wiped out, you‚Äôre buying calls just above Where you sold them. You profit when stock goes up. 


Add the two together and you get a capped loss, with a high upside if you win. Win means below $270.

He did this for a few reasons, one being margin requirements, being bearish and wanting to cap his upside risk, if msft goes to 300 he really doesn‚Äôt get effected more than the spread he sold 

If msft trades lower than 267.5 he stands to make about 203 bucks per counteract or 36,540

If MSFT drops to $230, you are in the money. If you exercise, you could buy 100 shares at $230 and have the right to sell them for $240. so your option goes up in value (it's worth $1000, not taking into consideration the greeks)

Essentially, if you buy a put you're betting on the stock dropping

If you sell a put, you're taking the premium, but if the stock goes down below the strike price you have to have the cash available to buy 100 shares of the stock at the strike price. If I sell a $240 put on MSFT with a 12/1 expiration date, and the stock drops to $230, I have to pay $24,000 to buy 100 shares of MSFT",d_1_z_z,wallstreetbets,5.0

4,2021-08-02,"Since you are broke af and I don't like seeing people who have no idea what they are doing lose their money when they are already broke, here are my two cents: 

Your stock picks and play are shit, and do not ""Do your part"" since this is not an organized group and almost everyone is here to make money for themselves and only themselves, and so should you.

If you want to make money do not put your money in any of the ""hot stocks"" since your risk of ruin is pretty massive, though if you are a degenerate gambler who wants to treat Wallstreet as a Casino go ahead maybe you'll be right this week. Safe and Stable that will make you money are companies and funds like SPY, MSFT, and AAPL. High Risk and Volatile that may have higher returns are like ROKU, TSLA, and AMD. 

HOOD is not going to die/continue to go down since every retard on WSB and new investor is basically still using their platform. If you try to short it at open I guarantee you will have your asshole ripped open wider than a goatsie picture if you hold that position for more than a couple days since your only option would be to short sell it, aka what hedgefunds did before getting gaped for $4bil on GME. There is a lot of buy pressure behind the company so I wouldn't be surprised if it goes above IPO price within a month and higher by EOY.

1,2021-08-05,"The mention of Microsoft as the 2017 customer was very bullish and leads me to believe either: 

A) Drew Markham/MVIS General Counsel and M&amp;A Ace reviewed the MSFT/MVIS Contract/NDA and determined they were within their rights to disclose the relationship publicly (which gives MVIS significantly greater negotiating leverage in discussing an acquisition of the Near-Eye Display (NED) AR vertical, which powers the Hololens 2). The announcement puts significantly more pressure on MSFT to acquire the NED vertical, especially considering the national security risks associated with this critical IP being vital to the $22B US Army IVAS contract. The Department of Defense has conducted a thorough review and I‚Äôm sure they have identified that Microsoft not owning the rights to the ‚ÄúMiracle *MicroVision* Display Engine‚Äù represents a national security threat. It would make sense for the DoD to put pressure on MSFT to acquire this IP to prevent it from falling into enemy hands.

or

B) Microsoft gave MicroVision the green light to announce the relationship because MSFT is about to announce acquiring the NED vertical.

Either way it is BAFF (*Bullish as F#cking F#ck*).

Also, MVIS is positioning itself to be a global leader in automotive LiDAR with best-in-class tech in terms of resolution, specs, and scalability. The IAA Mobility Summit in Munich is coming up in September and MicroVision is hosting the DVN Automotive LiDAR Conference and Expo in Frankfurt in November.

&gt;The DTCC guarantees that the transfer will happen and eliminates the risk of a single broker going under rippling across the market.

&gt;In exchange, the DTCC collects a fee per trade and requires some collateral from the brokers to ensure they have the assets to complete the transaction. It‚Äôs like putting a refundable deposit on a purchase that reduces the middleman‚Äôs risk while the package is in the mail, with full payment due once it arrives. The DTCC‚Äôs collateral requirements for brokers are calculated by a much more complex formula, based on the specific shares‚Äô notional value, volatility, and other variables.

&gt;For a relatively risk-free transaction‚Äîin liquid, less volatile stocks like, say,¬†[Apple](https://www.barrons.com/quote/AAPL)¬†(AAPL) or¬†[Microsoft](https://www.barrons.com/quote/MSFT)¬†(MSFT)‚Äîthat collateral requirement could be around the order of 10% of the transaction value. For a stock like GameStop this week, the DTCC‚Äôs formula might spit out a collateral requirement several times higher than that because it takes on greater risk. That‚Äôs because the DTCC could be on the hook to deliver an asset that‚Äôs worth a materially different amount on the settlement date than the trade date if one of the brokers involved can‚Äôt complete the transaction.

&gt;When traders are using margin to buy, the broker needs to come up with the cash on its own. And when there‚Äôs a large imbalance between a broker‚Äôs buy and sell orders for a given security, it doesn‚Äôt net out as cleanly at the end of the day, meaning more collateral is required.

&gt;All of those factors applied to Robinhood and Gamestop on Thursday. The stock traded in a wide range from $112 to $438 on heavy volume, its users were predominantly placing buy orders for the shares, and many were using margin.

&gt;And those are the reasons the DTCC asked brokers for more collateral for each such trade. The clearing house didn‚Äôt want to be caught with brokers not having the funds they need to settle. Therefore, Robinhood and others restricted buying on these highflying stocks until it could come up with enough cash to pay collateral. Robinhood allowed users to sell the stocks because the selling broker puts up the shares as collateral, not cash.",Kildragoth,wallstreetbets,29.0

15% short interest on a ticker with monster volume like $AMC is nothing. A short squeeze with those metrics is next to impossible. It's like me saying $MSFT or $AAPL is gonna short squeeze.

Now, if you're referring to a gamma squeeze (which is what happened last time), that's also impossible, since the OI on the options chain is less than 1/15th of what it was the first time, and there's no upwards price pressure, meaning we have no way to get the ball rolling.

The FTD stat is also largely useless, as we've seen time and time again, that it's been proven to mean absolutely nothing.

5,2021-08-10,"Stop buying calls, especially short dated calls. If they don‚Äôt go up in that day theta rips them hard. 


Key thing: take your time. 


Use calls in two scenarios: 


1. Where you are bullish on the eventual multi-month share price increase. Buy 60 days out. Look at graph. Buy in a trough if possible. Look at IV. If there are multiple strikes that look good buy the one with lower IV so you don‚Äôt get IV crushed and/or gain from IV increase. Buy with break even not too far out of the money. Be reasonable. 

I am an idiot too and go for big bangers on shorter dates but it‚Äôs stupid 90% of the time. Just go for 5% out of the money if possible. Decent IV is 30-50%. Check IV rank. Check the price you‚Äôre paying. How much gain is already built in. 


For example if the stock is at 100 and you think it‚Äôs going to 105-110, but premiums for a 105 strike 60days out costs $20, no way. Don‚Äôt do it. Look at the big boys calls for good healthy comparison. Visa. Msft. Googl. 


2. It is a potential pump that has started but IV is still low. You are in early. In only the rarest circumstances will it work to go in after the stock has already shot up for the day. IV is high. Premiums are crazy. It‚Äôs pumped. Second day pump isn‚Äôt uncommon but not as strong so IV collapses and shreds your premium. 


Don‚Äôt make small bets. You pay less attention. You let it go easier. 


If you have $1m portfolio, make $200k bets. If you‚Äôre an idiot you will make stupid bets and lose. If you‚Äôre not then youll take your time, learn a bit about the company, financial past, where it‚Äôs going, expectations. Competitors and their valuations. What chatter exists. Stock specific subs are good for info but also are very biased. And look at the options chain. Find a good strike OTM. 


Buying ITM is entirely different. 


Good luck. If you slow down and try, it will work. 


Easy one is just to wait until tech earnings date is announced and it‚Äôs 2mo out, buy for minor OTM if it looks good. 


Sorry new ‚Äúrule‚Äù number 3: SELL. 


Ya you might los out on 800% but you got 200% so fuck it. Better that then a 30% loss. 


Monitor it too by the way. Check the volatility of the pricing. Don‚Äôt set a trailing stop that‚Äôs going to get hit by normal volatility. If you can‚Äôt stomach that, watch it often. If you can‚Äôt stomach that and the potential minor temporary drop - don‚Äôt buy calls.",Green_Lantern_4vr,wallstreetbets,5.0

0,2021-09-02,"Sell way OTM CCs on stocks you already own, so like 30 delta at most but 15 delta is safer and probably free money.  PMCC underlying should be the same criteria as if you wanted to just be long on the stock itself but the long call is cheaper than the stock so you can play on shit you couldn't afford to just buy 100 shares like AMZN, TSLA, etc.  

&amp;#x200B;

If you want a better strategy than the wheel, what I do is size my position in 200-share minimum size and then buy-write 100 shares with a CC and then a CSP for the other 100 shares, so basically a covered strangle.  Profits from both sides of the wheel, is as directional as you want it to be (but generally directional with positive delta), and captures profits from gains in the underlying instead of fucking right off with those like if you're just selling a CSP with the wheel.  If you get assigned on your CSP, then switch to just CCs.  If you get assigned on your CCs then either go back in or switch to another underlying.  I might get assigned on MARA if it keeps going up, but if so then I'll get assigned at 43 where my entry was 30 and my adjusted basis is probably closer to 25 so that's not bad for 6 weeks or so on a single position in a $10k account (actual account is closer to $35k but I'm pretending it's only $10k so I can practice this shit without blowing up my account).  This strategy ONLY works because we're in the longest bull market in history, but because of that I want to be more directional.  If we get into a crash, then chase your underlying down with CCs and roll to 50 delta every time your CCs hit like 80 delta to lock in the intrinsic in the contract for a small additional profit.  Also sell call credit spreads as it falls and buy back in at the bottom with all the premium you made during the fall.  On the way up, put credit spreads and CSPs will make you more money.  If it stays at the bottom, then condor the fuck out of it and set a limit buy like $1 below your short call so you can turn that shit into a covered call and a long call; if it drops then just take assignment on the short put if you like the stock.  


For PMCC, the good part is you can use it on stocks you can't afford so NVDA, AMD, TSLA, AAPL, MSFT (premium is shit though), FB, etc.  It's also a much more efficient use of capital than an actual CC with the stock in terms of your ROC since you can hold more positions (so trade more positions but trade smaller; read up on the Kelly Criterion for gamblers to figure out position sizing).  With 10k I'd recommend 3 positions with a maximum of maybe 4 or 5 positions at most.  With any options selling strategy, your goal is to get rich very slowly but consistently.  Aim for like 1% per week and you'll do fine.",professor_jeffjeff,wallstreetbets,0.0

12,2021-09-06,"There is no ideal timing for the market. You don't have to hold for the duration. I like MSFT and am mostly bullish on it, but the real questions I'd ask yourself are:

1. Are you happy with your gains?
2. Is there a better place for your money right now? MSFT has already run up, and stock charts don't generally go up and to the right indefinitely... even in this market. It may be that MSFT will continue on its climb at the rate it's going, but it could also go through a correction or something unexpected could happen. If there's a better place for that money to be, then you need to consider that.
3. Do you need the money for anything in the near future? Would you care if you lost it? If so, then pull out with a massive profit.
4. Have you considered only selling some of the position to capture profit and keeping the rest running? Or selling it and trading up to options on the same strike which are higher up so that you retain the value but remain ITM with the same overall risk? The ITM portion is already basically trading on intrinsic value, if you sell, say, the $200 and buy a $280, you'll capture $6,794 and still be in the money... in many brokers, doing this as a roll has some advantages, but at the numbers you're looking at not sure if they're material to you or not.
5. Do you have tax reasons for holding into next year?

Puts were magical at that time. $50 strike for like $40 premium. Insane. $800 calls for like $20 premium. 


Anyways. Since then what my approach is, is to sell incrementally as price goes up. I‚Äôve felt the horrible feeling of missing extreme gains and the relief of being rescued, and also the pain of missing out on bigger gains. 


I guarantee. The bad feeling of losing your gains is far worse than missing out on further gains. 


Commission cost is negligible so why not sell incrementally. It‚Äôs the only way you will be able to find the top without being burned. 


Once I even question it I should sell - that‚Äôs the indicator to sell some. Just set a tight trailing stop loss (limit or market) so you capture any near term upside. Still need to watch though. Set another one a little wider as a backup in case hard fast crash. If they don‚Äôt activate in a couple hours then I manually sell a chunk. 


Selling a chunk and seeing the cash in my account be humongous is a good feeling and combats the greed to continue gambling on the existing win. 


Even then, it is still hard, so sometimes you just need to override your emotions and say ‚Äúrule of 200% = sell 1/3, when not a dramatic sky rocket.‚Äù  If it‚Äôs enough to matter. 


Other thing I‚Äôd say is that GME amc and such were basically once a lifetime opportunities. Once in a decade at least. 


Another thing to Help moderate yourself and take gains is to remember that when you make big wins like this, thousands of people smarter than you are trying to take it away from you every second. Wall Street and other capital managers. While you are euphoric. They are actively working against you and they are smarter than you. You made a good trade. Maybe skill maybe luck. Probably both. Take the money and run. 


On GME amc type stuff you can‚Äôt really say what a good win top target is. But on other stuff you can. Like if msft shoots to 315 (likely by the way) your calls will triple. Is it likely that msft goes up to 450 the next week? No. Absolutely not. So take the money.

2,2021-10-03,"What would the different IC spreads be? The same spread width but shifted up and down strikes? 


Tell them to use OptionStrat and plug it in. Compare it to a similar none stacked IC that has the same risk and break even points. 


I did that with MSFT and shifted the strikes up and down by 10, so I have -20, -10, 0, +10, +20, with zero being the original strike. I compared it to a regular IC at similar strike but adjusted the width to match the break even prices on the stacked IC. Then I adjusted the quantity of both so that we were closer to a common max loss. It still was a bit off so then I took the net credit (max gain) and divided by the max loss to get a rough risk rate and applied it to each other. The stacked one showed a 20% higher net credit for the same risk. 


This is likely skewed because of low volume strikes on the stacked one having weird premiums. 


I did this on MSFT December 17 expiry. The stacked is 100 spread on the buy side and 50 spread on the sell side. Buy side put starts at 220, sell out starts at 245. You can work out the rest from that.",Green_Lantern_4vr,wallstreetbets,2.0

12,2021-10-04,"Just feels like we need to see a much bigger pullback for things to seem like they're priced reasonably, but who knows whether that will happen.

Our last major pullback was of course 12 months ago... at SPY 355-360.

We just topped around SPY 450-455 a month ago.  Just an unreal 25+% run over the past 12 months.

I'd feel really good about buying if we dip into the sub-400 range, but it'll probably require us to see an actual debt default in 2-3 weeks to reach that level (who knows whether that will happen, those types of ""debt ceiling"" events have always been overhyped, but maybe not this time).

More importantly than that, a lot of high growth stocks have been consolidating all year and if that happens to big tech for an extended period of time, we could see a bigger 6-12 month sideways range (like we saw from mid-2015 to mid-2016 during that taper tantrum/interest rate hike/debt ceiling episode where S&amp;P 500 didn't have a new high for almost a year).  Probably worth at least considering how we should trade if that comes to pass.

How would you trade if MSFT/AAPL/GOOG/FB/AMZN are basically range bound for 12 months and then maybe only banks and some re-opening plays and smaller value caps are moving up.

It's worth at least planning for a ""sideways"" year like that as markets absorb tapering + interest rate hike expectations to come.  Going back and looking at stocks in 2015-2016 and how they traded is a worthwhile idea.",zg44,wallstreetbets,12.0

2. Yes avoid earnings. Unless‚Ä¶ you have high volatility and have some reasonable assumption where the top and bottom bounds are. Ie. Is msft on ER going to dump to $200? No. Is it going to spike to $500? No. So if you can build an iron condor that has profit within those bounds you can make a pretty safe return. Have done it a few times. 
The IV can make it so your strike premiums let you widen the profitability spread enough. You‚Äôre selling more ITM or closer to ATM, so you are benefiting from any IV crush. 
Danger is you have to hold to expiry for max profit and the broker doesn‚Äôt like that given you have a short put.

1. Apple   
It's hard to believe that one of the world's largest companies by market capitalization was once in dire straits. While never actually filing for bankruptcy, **Apple (AAPL) was on the verge of going bust in 1997. At the last minute, arch-rival Microsoft (MSFT) swooped in with a $150 million investment and saved the company.**  
  
People have speculated that Microsoft only did this because it was worried that regulators would regard it as a monopoly without the competition from Apple in the marketplace.2Ôªø

SAN FRANCISCO ‚Äî **In 1997, Apple was on the ropes. The Silicon Valley pioneer was being decimated by Microsoft and its many partners in the personal-computer market.** It had just cut a third of its work force, and it was about 90 days from going broke, Apple‚Äôs late co-founder, Steve Jobs, later said.

Microsoft is also making long term plays trying to consume market share with defender ATP which bundles with their o365 suite and competes in the same space. 

If you want to place a pure play bet on cyber your best bet is CRWD or S. Valuations are high though especially when you look at S. I‚Äôll be looking for S sales growth keenly to see if they continue biting into CRWD market share.

As others have said mandiant may be a decent bet as well now that they‚Äôre separate from fireeye. I still think it‚Äôs an uphill battle for them to compete with crwd and s because they‚Äôve lost a lot of good talent and haven‚Äôt invested in their products enough over the years. 

Forget any of the legacy vendors eg mcafee. I can‚Äôt speak to cylance (formerly) now blackberry, but I‚Äôm not convinced they will compete long term with crwd s and msft in the endpoint space.

17,2021-11-01,"People don't get why Tesla is going up because they have no idea how the market works or what to look at.

$TSLA is up due to retailer mass consolidation. Ten(well now 9) stocks are basically pushing the three major indexes as people spend the last two years tired of figuring out charts, being burned by earnings and memes, and the recent higher prices for goods which give them less to spend.

Tesla is one of those 9 stocks. That's it.

In fact at this point 60% of retail are in these 9 stocks. All it takes is to manipulate one of them by a decent amount and the whole thing crumbles.

People are stubborn and make themselves believe they are causing the upward trends in the etfs or Tesla when they aren't. Tesla can drop to $400 in a couple days if institutions wanted it to. Many are already diversifying outside the most popular stocks the last two years (with some exceptions like MSFT).

Keep an eye on institutions during the FED meeting the next two days, you are going to see gradual movements to make it not seem obvious that they are preparing to take advantage of the dive.

If you are in Tesla now and over $100k+ in profits then take it out. Don't hold at this point. There isn't time to correct after the FED meeting as you will likely be priced out. Puts will be much more expensive in the next couple weeks for high value stocks.",MvCSpiderman,wallstreetbets,17.0

In the short term, if CRSR wants to improve its share price, they need to dump their cash cows on an established firm like MSFT and launch a crypto-based multi-level marketing scheme that promises to end climate change and require a vaccine pass.  
  
 In the long term, CRSR is looking like one of the juicier fundamental plays in the markets, they are riding a strong macro trend in gaming and media, streamers have essentially replaced TV for people 6-20 years of age and gaming is probably the most common hobby of that generation and tends to be kept up over the years.

I‚Äôm a rank amateur at this game. I have three kids, aged 14, 12, &amp; 10. About 7 years ago they were each given 10k from their grandpa to open an investment account. I opened an account for each them here in Australia trading on the ASX. I‚Äôve only purchased blue chip shares that pay 4-10% returns year in year out, and all those dividends are reinvested back in to those stocks when issued. Each birthday I give them $1000 to add to their portfolios, and $1000 each at Xmas. The eldest two are sitting on almost 75k each, and the youngest is just under 70k. 

By the time they‚Äôre 21 and have access to their accounts, they should have around 150k perhaps more if the bank of mum and dad don‚Äôt raid itü§£. It gives them a leg up to start their lives. They‚Äôre not allow to blow it on cars etc, they can use a bit for travel, but I‚Äôm hoping it can get them in to the property market and or keep the portfolio going until they‚Äôre much older. They‚Äôve had one really lucky break with one share which has doubled and makes up good slice of their portfolio and pays big dividends each year. That aside it‚Äôs been pretty basic investments. If it was the US market it would stocks like MSFT, CRM, TSLA, AAPL that I‚Äôve tipped money in to. So relatively low risk and just playing the long game and I‚Äôve not sold a single share in that time.

That‚Äôs why low rates have buoyed what quants call growth stocks, epitomized by tech names riding structural trends like Tesla Inc. or Netflix Inc.

Yeah no. When real rates are at zero, money is free. And guess what ? Everyone including their grandma puts everything they have including the Mortgage in the stock market. But here is the trick : your grandma mostly buys SPY and a bunch of boomer ETFs... Yeah well guess what: *SPY is literally MSFT AMZN TSLA and GOOGL.* So everyone is literally yoloing tech stocks, thus creating a self fulfilling loop of ever-increasing retarded valuations. There is a reason why this Mongolian Basket Weaving forum came to be during the longuest 0-rate policy period the Fed has ever seen... I mean there are *kids yoloing their student debt weekly* ffs. 

This guy is a retard if he thiks the fed is going to pull the plug on the middle class.

It did, so now i'm up to 8k. Proceeded to think that i'm a genius and tried to make several of these bets on AMD, NVIDIA, MSFT, AMAZON, GOOGLE, all at the same time...

I fully agree - after seeing all the gains on this sub from FDs (weeklies) it's kind of hard not to feel like ""F it, I wanna make some money too"" and YOLO your money in - VERY BAD DECISION. It would be hard for me to pay attention at work and school since my mind would just be focused on trying to chase gains and praying that my portfolio wouldn't be red. Then, I eventually lost like $4k in total. It was initially hard to stomach the loss but I had to just accept it as a learning lesson. 

I also just wanted to say I fully agree with you on the LEAPS in safe companies. 80% of my portfolio is stocks and 20% LEAPS. LEAPS are great ways to control more of a stock with less money and I make sure to only buy LEAPS on great fundamental companies (NVDA and AMD) but am planning to buy some SPY GOOGL and MSFT LEAPS that you mentioned as well.

I just want to say that I actually sleep better now and my quality of life is MUCH better. I realized I just couldn't handle the stress of 90%+ swings in my portfolio without being glued to it or worrying ""IS IT TIME TO SELL?"" LEAPS and shares remove all of that because they don't really have an ""expiration."" Shares are unlimited and LEAPS are like 2-3 years out so there's no rush to feel like: THE STOCK HAS TO RALLY 20% in a day, all you have to do is choose companies you have high conviction in and let them naturally make their way up.",Khatib22,wallstreetbets,16.0

44,2021-11-05,"I own a ton of leaps and yea on some companies it‚Äôs a good winning strategy until something happens in the future that fucks things up.  Just imaging if you had leaps 2 years ago expiring in April/may 2020 when corona hit and the entire market went over the cliff, yea your leaps would have been wiped out probably.  The point is, you just can‚Äôt be certain that nothing will happen sometimes down the line which can affect your leap investments.  Having said that tho, I still buy them but I do sell once the profits grows and simply buy either new leaps or shorter term plays.  The best part about leaps, even if something was to happen along the line that knocks them down, you can use it as a buying opportunity and as they rebound depending on how far out the expiry, you could stand to profit greatly.  You‚Äôve gotta mix it up a bit too with short, mid and long expiry dates .  Find good steady companies that grow a good pace.  Msft, apple are not too bad.  They move at snails pace daily but if u zoom out on the yearly chart they do well. And I think they will continue to grow, windows platform is not going anywhere.  

On thing to also keep in mind. Sometimes you may not find a buyer when you hit your sell Button on those leaps.  I tried selling one yesterday it was a 2024 expiry, didn‚Äôt have much in there but the order lingered throughout the day, even tried lowering the sell price and it just didn‚Äôt execute.

They‚Äôre up against NVIDIA in the edge computing and autonomous spaces, which is the main portion of the market where their GPU efforts could pay off (and possibly gaming consoles?).

AAPL is a poor example. They have a high market cap because they‚Äôre one of a handful of major stock holdings in mutual funds sold in retirement accounts. A typical retirement account will have at least 5% in AAPL. Retail accounts for most of their moves that aren‚Äôt virtually in lockstep with MSFT, which accounts for a similar percentage in a typical retirement account.

AAPL was a standard tech stock play.  Nothing fancy but they'll always do better than 10% and are relatively safe.  Too many millennials buying their products and drinking the koolaid.  I have an XS Pro Max from 218 that I'm more than happy with.

Truth is no one knows what will happen. Just because tech is over valued doesn‚Äôt mean we have to have a -30% limit down. We could just see less alpha until things catch up. The only major pull back we have seen has been on meme stocks or Covid stocks that were way over valued. Like way way

It‚Äôs why even if you aren‚Äôt investing (who in WSB is) you should at least be making your gambles with underlyings that are somewhat sensible. Buying calls on a company like Microsoft with a PE of ~30 might be more reasonable.

Also btw in relation to MSFT they had a PE of 68 (double what it is today) in March 2018. 3 years later their PE is half that and trading at 3x the price. So anyone who says a company is ‚Äúovervalued‚Äù needs to stop thinking in terms of just the present.",JGWol,wallstreetbets,7.0

3,2021-12-08,"I should've been a little bit more specific, sorry.

I started out with 40k savings, and bought almost all AAPL/MSFT/QQQ shares in 2016 and held until now. A lot of those stocks have gotten 400%+ gains over the 5 years. Then every paycheck I got throughout the years, I kept putting money into stocks into a mixed ratio of safe stocks vs high-risk stocks. I would always make sure that I was allocating most of my portfolio into safe stocks, and a small portion into riskier option plays. I would never risk more than 5-10% of my portfolio on option plays / earnings plays / meme stocks / what have you. I made some big mistakes on options, and made some gains on options. In the end I think I only profited a little bit, and I still have a ways to go when it comes to learning how to be a better options trader. However, my ""long term"" stocks have mostly always gone up, and by safe I mean I was periodically buying AMD, TSLA, NVDA, HD, FB through the years on top of the FAANG that I already had and \*never\* selling. I misspoke when I said I turned 40K into 400K. It was more like I started with 40K, and kept adding money in (from my paychecks) and buying brand-name stocks until my portfolio rose to 400K. In the end I think out of the 400K total amount, almost 100k of it was my own capital from the money I saved from my paychecks from 2016-now (which includes the 40K I started with). The rest were gains. I know this goes against the entire WSB mantra of YOLO-ing everything but at the end of the day, long term stocks are rewarding with patience. The YOLO part is all fun but \*extremely\* high risk and may not be the best idea if you can't handle big losses. Hope that makes sense",AshamedEstate1974,wallstreetbets,3.0

Allocate a smaller portion of your portfolio for fun ""meme"" stocks, or trading options.

This way even if you lose all your money doing the latter, at least you know you're still gaining money on your safe stocks. You may win or lose playing the short game, but history says you'll always win playing the long game. You're risking too much of your portfolio (5k out of 13k) on meme stocks.

To do this, I‚Äôm gonna keep my $AAPL shares and either get another 100 shares to hold 300 shares outstanding or stay with 200 shares and one LEAPS. From here, I need to do some research on $INTC since my gut is saying they‚Äôve been beaten down for far too long and start as 2 LEAPS and hope to gather enough premium and contract appreciation and turn them into 200 shares. Same strategy with $JPM, $AMD, $MSFT, and maybe even $COIN to be a bit spicy. $SPY and $QQQ will be going into my retirement accounts as LEAPS then to shares.

So we really need a blowoff type move on those names or rotation to some stressed names to drive the next move.  Of course we just saw GOOG and MSFT go straight up for a year so it is possible for AAPL to melt up to 200.

It's just worth thinking about those types of things when you consider how bullish or bearish you are.

If you look at AAPL's run the past month, AAPL only really has had a much bigger run one time and that was right after the pandemic started during the massive tech melt up in the middle of 2020.

33,2021-12-09,"The cloud storage functionalities are actually similar and, in some cases, better for Dropbox. Check this out: [https://www.cloudwards.net/dropbox-vs-google-drive-vs-onedrive/](https://www.cloudwards.net/dropbox-vs-google-drive-vs-onedrive/)

You'd be surprised, but actually the number of users between DBX and MSFT/GOOG/AAPL doesn't differ that much. Dropbox has 700mln+, Google Drive reached 1bln last Nov so it's probably around 1.1bln now and I couldn't find user stats for MSFT. iCloud is obviously targeting Apple users. I think they had 620mln users in 2020 (Source: [https://www.businessofapps.com/data/apple-statistics/](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/apple-statistics/)) although this says they had 850 mln in 2018 so I'm not sure about the correct latest number (Source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/11/apple-could-sell-icloud-for-the-enterprise-barclays-says.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/11/apple-could-sell-icloud-for-the-enterprise-barclays-says.html)). BOX only has 77mln so they're the little fish in the big pond. My point is that Dropbox actually has a comparable number of users to the likes of Google, Microsoft and Apple. Box is lagging behind massively especially given the fact they've been around since 2005, even before Dropbox which was founded in 2007.

Google and Microsoft seem to target businesses more, whereas DBX is focused on individuals, small businesses, creators, self-employed people, etc. It's a different target market and that's pretty much it. The cloud storage market size is big enough for all of these. It's easy to dismiss DBX, but looking at the details draws a different picture.

I think this next week will likely be the ""beginning of the end"" of that kind of move as the Fed tips its hand on rate hikes next year (dot plot) and moves to bring tapering to a fast end.  That's the final ""shock"" that the market needs to absorb.

AAPL is in a similar situation to where TSLA was at the end of October, when TSLA was passing $1000 in the final part of its blowoff move to $1200.

I would not be loading puts on AAPL until we see volume slow and and there isn't the massive firehose of money flying into the stock for safety.  This move will partially unwind at some point, but a $20 fall off $210 would leave the stock higher than it is now so loading puts at $180 is probably not the best idea.",zg44,wallstreetbets,30.0

16,2021-12-11,"A few flaws in the arguments.

Amazon, MSFT, Google has thousands of mid-senior level managers where things are easy to execute because of the brand name itself.

It doesn't take a genius to be moderately successful at AWS, Google Ads, Microsoft Office. In fact you used the perfect word 'cushy'. The roles were too cushy that they aren't challenged to come up with solutions and most likely they coasted along. Getting these people are pure smoke and mirrors (unless they got the star performer themselves, which they didn't). I highly doubt they'll come and turnaround an Old Corp. 

These execs also had the top 1% ile talent working for them. It won't be the same for GME. For one they don't have margins to pay top dollar for worker talent.

Also Ha Ha Ha on $1.3 Billion Quarter. GME made more per in quarter in 2019 and 2018. So, even with 1000x brand awareness when compared to 2019, they can't convert into actual sales. 

No one can beat Amazon in electronics retail, unless they are willing to take large losses. Amazon has the logistics, software, infrastructure, pricing power to beat GME in every dimension. So, GME has no choice but to race to near 0% profit margin. 

If it's anything above 2%, Amazon or Walmart or Costco or Best Buy will come and eat them. 


Retailers had an easy 2021 comparison vs 2020, while most tech stocks had the opposite (easy 2020 comparison but tough 2021 comparison) and see how they got clobbered in 2021. 

For GME, 2022 is the time of reckoning where their costs will explode while having poor YoY growth comparison metrics. They will go back to anemic single digit growth compared to massive cost explosion. 

Finally, since GME isn't making any profits in the foreseeable future , raise in interest rates will be brutal. At this point GME/AMC/BB value is only propped by retards. Unfortunately in finance, ""Show me the money"" matters in the long run. (see PTON, DOCU for how much brutal market can be in a few months)

tl; dr Watch GME's expenses explode without meaningful growth in revenue. It's a $20 stock when fairly valued.",qroshan,wallstreetbets,16.0

She has given the impression to the world that investing in up and companies that will change the world will beat the market by a significant margin. She was proven right because of the interest rate climate of 2020 and finding it hard to repeat her success in 2021. These companies are also interest rate dependent which actually makes them bad investments and she most likely knows that but she would probably never admit it.

That leaves her with trading these companies on a frequent basis and as the size of the fund grows, it becomes hard to beat the market with hyperactive portfolio management.
