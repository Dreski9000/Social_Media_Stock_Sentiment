TSLA is priced high because people believe in the company, want their products, and expect them to turn massive profits while gradually edging into the US automaker market.

TSLA has the attention of young optimistic people, and their competitors haven't given individual retail investors any reason to be excited about Ford, GM, VW, BMW, Dodge, Honda or Toyota. It's only old guard money managers keeping legacy automakers funded. The average Tesla shareholder probably has tens of shares at best.

When the big players can't match a 2012 model S on specs at the same price point, you just know they're out of touch, not taking the electric vehicle sentiment seriously enough, and way behind.

Yes, Tesla has more fit and finish problems according to the literature on hand, but as the new kid on the block, they are also under a lot more scrutiny, and the big automakers have a vested interest in making Tesla look bad.

In currently in 12 02/19 BBY 105c as an earnings play.  Their chart is beat down to hell and I foolishly thought a 20% sell-off from their ATH was an over reaction.  Doesn't really move though.  Also in several 02/19 CRM 230c, same situation.

Have 3000 shares of RKT I sell covered calls on and honestly this is the smartest play for me.  I sell them 50 cents out of the money 2 weeks out at a time.  Making $500 a week since this thing doesn't move either.

Last Friday I scooped 10 PLTR 24c for this week as a total gamble.  I never believed in PLTR or their valuation but just thought it would pop, again just a gamble.

AMZN made $10,000 for me last week, but have since dumped about 5 of that since on bad plays.

Need to just slow down and wait this out.  Some tickers are definitely doing well this past 8 weeks, but a lot are just sideways.

42,2021-01-08,"seen a lot of bitching about bezos not splitting AMZN.

he won't do it. why?

- AMZN split aggressively in the dotcom boom. They had something like three splits before everything crashed, and because they did so many they ended up almost being a penny stock for a short amount of time with people continually pointing out price collapse while forgetting about all the splits. Bezos has always regretted that.

- Stock splits really don't do anything for the company fundementally other than make shares cheaper (or to get an index), usually they're just done to appease analysts and fund managers. Bezos hates both of these groups of people (as anyone can tell you from listening to him on an earnings call, remember ""you might want to sit down"" from a couple quarters back when he was explaining how we was going to spend all amzn's revenue on covid-related expenses?) from years of having to fend off ""amzn will never be profitable lmaoooo"" accusations from them.

The point about profitability is that Tesla's mission is to transform the world to sustainable energy, not simply to make $$$ as the priority.

I also thought the potential upside was better than other established companies I follow like AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, etc... so at the time it seemed logical to go allin on TSLA.  To be sure, I had no idea it was going to up as much as it did last year.

As for GME, I do follow the meme stocks on WSB and it seems that the probability of an actual short squeeze due to GME transitioning to an online presence is good enough to gamble some money on it.  It's a very small position given the size of my portfolio.",Pokerhobo,wallstreetbets,246.0

Question is just who from the current generation of companies will be there at the end.

It's the holy grail of tech and anyone who thinks the time and safety benefits, for consumer and logistical use, aren't already worth trillions of dollars has their head up their ass. Think about what percentage of time modern civilization spends driving, the loss of life involved, the amount of money circulating in logistics.

Only one company is finding success with a version of FSD that will ever be usable outside of the most meticulously mapped and updated major cities. Machine learning isn't something that's easy to rip off or replicate, it takes years and years of meticulous training and programming. This one company has also gone all-in on full vertical integration and ownership of all components of its products, making the most outlandish and bullish bet on the aforementioned multi-trillion dollar market that doesn't exist yet. They use highest grade marketing materials and an emphasis on perfect UI design like the current most valuable company in the world. The hardware doesn't need to be great to have sky high profit margins and shit all over competitors just like Apple does to Google.

Tesla is going to multiply several times over in the next five years and still be undervalued. It's like if Henry Ford had been poised to dominate the oil, shipping, and consumer transportation industries in one go. All bears can talk about is retarded QC issues from a company that was desperately trying to stay alive against massive political machinations, short sellers, and competition from the most valuable tech companies in the world. That company can now raise $5B at a time, blip their holders' share price 1%, and nobody gives a singular fuck.

I've sold a lot of what I bought pre-2014, but here are a few more screenshots of stock I bought way back when. My wife, who studied economics at Harvard, tried to calm me down in 2008 when our 401k got cut in half with the market crash, telling me it was absolutely the time to buy, buy, buy, which we did--sank $20k into a bloody market. I bought AMZN, NFLX, SIRI, GM, F, and a bunch of shit that died (Blockbuster) or was reborn, like GE, with the original stock left to rot. And each year I'd drop another $10k-$15k in the market, watching our 401k bounce back.

As it stands, they can do OTA updates, should be able to derive recurring revs (subscriptions), have 8 years of big data on cars, and make batteries. Tesla is not a car maker, it's Hornsdale Power Reserve (AUS). 
2. 2020-2021 massive stimulus and spending ahoy. Massive.

Do your DD on a ticker that has strong history and fundamentals, this includes basic TA and figure out support and resistance. So take a company like AMZN, I doubt this company will ever tank and it's currently trading around 3180 with 3500 being it's all time high. Analysts have price targets around 4k which is hopefull but not foolish. So how do you get in on this action? Say AMZN goes down 2% on a pretty red day with everything else? Open up a bull put spread and set your strikes down to 3080/3075 respectively and stretch out your exp to atleast two weeks, collect roughly 105$ in credit and when AMZN goes back up close out, free up your collateral and make another trade.

\-What happens when it keeps dipping even after I open the spread and my contracts have more extrinsic value? Simple, average down. 

\-Don't have money to Average down? well that's when Theta works in your favor and you can wait it out.

\-What if Armageddon happens and the underlying takes a huge dump and exp is close? then fucking roll out your exp and hopefully you didn't go full retard and overleverage your entire account into this one trade and if you did then you deserve to be here.",gherna67,wallstreetbets,12.0

I feel like I'm missing something, but how is GME going to be the next eCommerce website when there are already more convenient alternatives and GME hasn't invested enough in online infrastructure and at this point is at least 10 years behind? If anything I think we would be jumping at Epic Games for becoming the biggest disruptor in the videogame industry over the last 2 years with Fortnite and launching their own store capable of competing with Steam due to brand exclusivity and the amount of free games they give away. What engineering has GME invested in their online platform that gives them a better edge than AMZN? Youtube and Twitch are huge markets for video game content already that can be leveraged and integrated with their own marketplace. Newegg tried the Amazon approach by allowing 3rd party sellers and flopped hard. I don't understand the appeal of GME unless you ignore the rest of the video game industry. Even Facebook is better positioned than GME with their own streaming platform, Oculus, and they already have a gaming marketplace with crappy javascript games that print money (btw I don't think FB gaming is good, just that on the surface it looks more promising than GME).

Got in RIOT and MARA calls last week and made 200% 

I bought SPY and AAPL calls this week which lost 30% value. Sold half of those contracts and bought some 10x leaps for PLUG. Was gonna just wait for it to grow but with today's spike, I couldn't help but sell.

Next play is AMZN. Too risky for calls for me so I bought 20 shares. Currently -400+ from ATH and earnings on February. Probably going to see run up soon.

Gonna also sell soon cause tech earnings are end of this month and im feeling real bearish with TSLAs earnings. Even if all other Tech beats, TSLA will be a catalyst and drop everyone else.",DogeWeTrust,wallstreetbets,163.0

Positive earnings for early life, their 2012-2016 ""lost money"" was spent in genius acquisitions, and miniscule given they were raking 8B a year to sustain the operation.  Positive.  Cash.  Flow.

&gt;they turn off the hyper growth mode switch , and become a cash cow.

that $8M hyper switch tho

&gt;It's a software tech company, the cost of future growth is baked into today's cost of revenue. When you hire 50 engineers today to create a software that will go live in 2 years, that cost of is added to this year's cost of revenue not when the software is out

So you sell a call at a higher price to offset it.  Second, you make your most money at the date of maturity.  So in this case, I'm convinced AMZN will be at least 3100 or above on Jan 29.  So from this perspective, buying these call spreads is a no brainer.

Probably not. Fees are now stabilizing above 30%. For reference, AAPL and AMZN are both 0.3%. 

Conceivably, they can continue to just cover on the down swings. The problem is that the volume is so low with restricted buying and people not selling, any real covering would shoot the price up. We don't know exactly how many shares the shorts have, but if it's still over 100% of float then it will take months. Considering that they've already lost billions, they are hoping that a drop happens soon. 

Realistically, their deadline is Q4 earnings because that's when we'll likely get a big announcement from Gamestop.

[This](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/amzn/latest-real-time-trades) is Amazon's latest trades. Tons of buys in multiples of 100. [GE](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ge/real-time), just about the most boring stock I can think of, is also perfect batches of 100. I don't know where anyone is getting that orders of 100 mean it's manipulated. Yes, GME is probably manipulated out the ass, we know that, but the price might very well be dropping organically. AND THAT'S OKAY! That doesn't mean anything has changed in the market mechanics, that just means the price is going down. If the short squeeze is gonna squeeze, it'll squeeze at $300 or $30, it doesn't matter. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is almost certain that Melvin and Co have covered their original shorts at $6 and re-shorted at the current price. They're betting the stock will go down enough and that people will lose interest so that they can cover their shorts over a very long period of time and still profit. I'm not saying the squeeze won't squoze, but in order for that to happen, all lenders must call back the shares they lent in a similar timeframe. With the amount that lenders are making on interest for this stock and the amount of collusion and corruption going on, I don't see that happening for a long long time. Melvin will gladly lose 25M a day for months if it means they don't liquidate their entire firm in full public view. VW was different, as the announcement that Porsche had locked up a high fraction of the public float meant that at the time of the squeeze, VW had a much higher short interest than GME.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know why they're pushing silver so hard, but my only bet is that they're trying to direct mainstream attention and paper-hands away from GameStop so that this doesn't happen so publicly. Maybe they're trying to drive the price down enough to cover their new shorts and get out on top. These are smart guys, they know we plan on holding til we die. They've factored that into their decisions and are now doing with that what they are going to do anyway. What I'm trying to say is don't expect anything to happen for a while, if not ever.

I would then go to meet up with my friends and try not to act like a complete wreck. Occasionally, I would journal about it, and I wrote down some incredibly demeaning things about myself.

It took a long time, including stepping away from trading for over a year, for me to get over the shocking amounts of money I had lost. Eventually, I decided to get back in, but was careful to apply the lessons I'd learned to new strategies that eliminated the problems I had before.

JMIA has been announcing some pretty amazing stats and figures recently about expansion around Africa- a burgeoning and quickly growing continental market.

Here's why: Hedge funds that bet against GameStop and other Reddit-favored stocks were forced to take steps to counter their losses. Some faced margin calls, requests to put up more capital when positions weaken. To raise cash, they had to sell completely unrelated but highly liquid stocks such as Apple ([AAPL](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=AAPL&amp;source=story_quote_link)) and Amazon ([AMZN](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=AMZN&amp;source=story_quote_link)). And that in turn caused other investors to take chips off the table, continuing the negative feedback loop.

624,2021-02-02,"To basically make it more attractive to people who might not normally consider investing in the stock because it's too expensive.

Example, last year $TSLA did a 5-1 split so if you had 10 shares on the date they decide to ""record"" shareholders you'd have 50 shares on the date they ""execute"" the split as long as you hold on to those shares until the distribution date. If $TSLA didn't do that their share price would now be around $4.2k at open today which makes it not look attainable for a lot of people (in comparison AMZN opened at $3,380). 

I'm noting these 2 because some people might hear about the split and decide to buy stock after the ""shareholder of record"" date but before the distribution of new shares. If that's the case, most of the time you'd be entitled to the additional shares but not all the time. Since I'm not a trading expert and cannot give trading advice, you'll need to do some chit-chat time with your own advisor.  

I honestly want to see if $AMZN will want to execute a split or not or if the trend now is to have a dong contest for highest price per share.",ItsMeWynter,wallstreetbets,624.0

131,2021-02-03,"Boomer story:

When I was in grad school 15ish years ago I bought some Amazon stock because they not only sold textbooks cheaper than the bookstore, but they also delivered textbooks to you.  That was pretty much the extent of my DD.  I had been I school forever, textbooks were expensive and it was pain going to the bookstore, most people I know started using AMZN.  Ended up with 150 shares at an average cost of about $19.  

My parents told me it was a terrible investment because ""It's dangerous to spend money online.""

Then the idiots at Amazon decided they were going to sell more than just textbooks AND start this new ridiculous thing called Prime.  What kind of idiot would pay a recurring fee to buy something online when you could go to the store and get it immediately.

CNBC and all other news outlets said Amazon was worth $1-2 a share at most based on fundamentals, and they would be the final ""dot com"" era company to go under.  I didn't know what ""fundamentals"" meant, but some guy on TV did some math with terms I had never heard and showed Amazon was worth $1.5 a share.  I also remember reading an article that said ""substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future"" because they had to develop and implement the technology and advertise and remember thinking that sounds really bad.

My thinking at the time: Oh man, I have less than $5000 to my name and I have about half of that in Amazon stock.  I mean, if I buy textbooks from them and pay online, and they deliver them with no issues then I don't see why they couldn't deliver everything else the University bookstore sells. I think all my friends would do that as well. But my parents and the financial news are telling me will they will fail, and I don't understand all this P/E, earnings reports, etc.... And if it goes to $1-2 I'm out around $2k.  That's a lot of money.  I need to get out ASAP before it goes way down.

With price fluctuations the next couple days it was down and up, but I caught the top at $22 and sold all 150 shares.  $450 cash money profit!  And from less than $3k initial investment in a couple week period.",mbhudson1,wallstreetbets,131.0

141,2021-02-03,"I'm holding.

The only thing that really matters is that a huge portion of retail was locked out of, or severely limited on buy action. 

This lead to low volume ladders on the down side. It's clearly visible on the volume levels since last Thursday. 

It appears that there is a significant portion of retail moving away from robinhood after this shit show. In-kind transfers take between 3-5 days to complete, till then all these accounts / shares are pretty much locked. 

Strong ladder attacks monday / tuesday on low volume while all those accounts are in transfer, AND restrictions on the ones left behind... well... we have what we have.

It's pretty blatant price manipulation, but like any regulators care as long as its retail traders getting F'ed. 

Maybe some shorts covered and opened new short positions, but the stock is still shorted an insane amount. They still have to cover, which means they have to buy REAL shares, not just jump back and forth with their buddies. 

I'm holding. We all (I hope) read the thesis. $80 is base RIGHT NOW (even Cramer said this, and we all know who he works for). Bull case $160, bear case $39. 

Personally, my case opinion is more on a market cap based on $CHWY. Gaming is just as big or bigger than pets. I think RC can pull a rabbit out of a hat with this and push the company forward to new heights. RC beat $AMZN at their own game, and chewy came out of no where. Game stop (love it or hate it) already has huge brand recognition in a huge growth industry.

GME @ 42b market cap($CHWY) = $602.15/share..  I dont care if it takes 5 years to get there.

 I'm holding.

99,2021-02-08,"i mean he didn't expand on it, so yea, based directly on what  he said, there are a lot of holes, and it was incredibly favorable looking.

first off SQ is not a reseller and doesn't do B&amp;M. SQ while tech is also in a completely different sector. It feels like he almost just looked for the most favorable valuation he could find and plopped it in.

A more apt comparison would be AMZN, who is a reseller and has their own tech ""side hustle"" (AWS). 

They have a P/S of 3. Target? P/S of 1. 

His own example of what Ryan Cohen could do was CHWY. P/S of 6 (remember this company hasn't even been public for 1 year yet).

So yes, raising a valuation with pretty much just a ""here is a valuable company, this should be the same"" stinks of a lot of wishful thinking and BS

The point is: Gamestop is a very bad long term invest. There are much more promising one's. Just taking AMZN, MSFT or more risky (what I'm doing currently): CDXS. About everything would make more sense than GME, BB, NOK or AMC... Those are all dead.

The more research I have done, the more I find stocks where institutions report owning more than 100% of the total shares issued.

Which, while I will accept there is a time lag, so reporting could be an issue, it isn't sufficient to accept seeing it everywhere. Even 120% ownership in a name brand store.

By this Summer, or Fall at the latest, we're going to see a global deflationary bust much worse than 2008, and rivaling 1929. We're talking +60% market drop across the board. And it won't recover to current levels for another 5 years after that.

So mark this post.

This IS the Great Melt-Up.  So, you are going to see a wild run up (as if 2020 wasn't wild enough). If you get out now, you could be leaving 15-20% gains on the table.  So, hold?  Well, don't try to time it too tight, because it could pop tomorrow, or some random Monday.  I'd rather leave 10% on the table now, and buy back AAPL or AMZN when they're at 40% of their current price.

The reason why I am not sure you can or should treat this as a tech company is really for one main reason.  At it's core RKT relies on loaning money in an extremely competitive industry.  There rates aren't much, if any lower than the competition.  

FB, Google, and AMZN's algos that they use to drive their business have a huge up front fixed cost but the variable costs are pretty low so for them to continue to grow it doesn't take much more than the initial investment to keep growth going.  RKT at its core has to come up with more capital to be able to make more loans.

I'd like to hear your opinion on why I'm wrong.  If they are working on algos to automate the lending process to further drive down costs etc. I think that would be a huge driver for growth and would set them apart from their industry peers.  I've not heard anything but again, I seriously could have missed it.  

It for sure seems undervalued.  They consistently beat expectations and they announced a $1bn share buy back at their last earnings and then the price went down which blew my mind.  Hope I hear from you.",IllUpvoteEverything,wallstreetbets,70.0

23,2021-02-13,"What did you buy? There are a ton of solid stocks that produce above average return over months and years like AMD, MSFT, AAPL, Amzn etc.

Maybe you need to slow down and look more long term. I am not advocating index funds, but at least pick individual stocks that have a shot at long term growth and not violent volatility because everyone is gambling on that stock - SNDL, BLNK, NKLA, etc.

By the way there are some that are mentioned on WSB that are actually pretty good stocks - PLTR, GME, NIO, BABA, etc. All depends on your time horizon. The media blew up GME but for anyone that bought any thing before 1/14 they at least 2 to 5x their investment even if they paper handed and sold at $50 to $100. The people that lost were the ones jumping in at $200 to $400 that didn't understand what was going on.",neothedreamer,wallstreetbets,23.0

So when saying AMZN it has a sentiment checker and itll say your mention is ""good"",  ""bad"" or ""neutral"".

The hedge funds probably aren't basing almost any decisions off of what this retarded sub does, but if you're a conspiracy theorist and think they are just use one to two tickers and add them to the end of your comments once and then a random character to prevent algos from dropping tickers if they're the last word.",tornado9015,wallstreetbets,288.0

347,2021-02-12,"Actually there's a strong case to be made that Amazon could be a 10bagger.

1.) They have an enormous moat. Nobody else in the USA is even capable of competing. Sure, retail stores do have considerable market share but Amazon is competitive, and for anyone who lives in a city Amazon is way more efficient.

2.) They have rock solid finances.

3.) They are acting more and more as a marketplace than an actual vendor. Why build your own website or rent commercial real estate when you can setup in a factory and sell your shit through Amazon?

4.) As the world gets more digital they will become more prominent.

5.) Their only real competition comes from Chinese and Indian companies who are essentially doing the same thing, and neither are likely to gain traction in the USA due to Amazon's already prolific infrastructure.

6.) They have a P/E of 48.96. This is high by value investing standards, but it's much lower than other hot companies. TSLA has a P/E around 1400-1500 at the moment. If AMZN had a PE of 1500 it would have a price of like $100,000 a share. This was calculated using the Dr. Parik Patel methodology.

7.) Almost nobody is shorting them (0.77% float). Hedge funds, retail investors, boomers, etc are happy to buy and hold right now even though the price is well north of $3000 / share.

8.) Announcing a dividend or a split could be the catalyst to send it to the moon. Just look at TSLA earlier this year.

Disclaimer: I own a few shares of Amazon and plan to DCA up to double what I currently have over the next few months.",Hydrocoded,wallstreetbets,347.0
348,2021-02-12,"Definitely do. I expect it to be well over $350 by expiration.

Basically if take the growth rates of revenue drivers you can easily make an argument for topline growth. Look at the large e-commerce platforms and digital payment companies in the U.S.

You have trillions in market cap between AMZN, PYPL, Ebay, and SHOP alone.

AMZN is only $3245 at the time of writing this. It should easily be sitting above $4500 per share. Amazon is a global supermassive behemoth. It's body is the world's largest online retailer, but it also has tentacles in produce and groceries, delivery, handmade markets, drone innovation, and a robust variety of electronics that integrate flawlessly into the Internet-of-Things.

Amazon is a company far ahead of its time! It's global influence will only continue to grow, and I see nothing but profits. We could easily get this stock about $4000 to show the world its potential, and then the rest of the world would just carry us on to profits! In 10 years time, we will see new homes built specifically to integrate into Amazon's IoT with laundry rooms and kitchens having smart order buttons to refill depleted detergents and groceries! Speakers in every room will allow your music to flawlessly follow you around your home! Smartbulbs will sense when you enter and leave a room as well as daylight conditions to maximize energy saving capabilities as well as provide the perfect amount of lighting!

AMZN is not just the future, it will be a way of life! But only if WE do our part in showing the market what it is capable of!",OliverWotei,wallstreetbets,377.0

They have crazy profit margin, incredible growth rate, and, when compared to AMZN, way undervalued. Hell, half of AMZN is fueled by BABA suppliers.

Either way, I'm pretty bullish on this company, I think it will hit 500ish unless they are hiding bad info and depending on what the Chinese regulators do ( hopefully they tone down the crazy Gestapo things).

Google MORE Act.  Google Who sponsored MORE Act. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the reality of decriminalization...  It has nothing to do with law enforcement, it's about banking.  

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, all cannabis business is cash or hard money lenders...  Once the MORE Act passes, the cannabis industry gets access to the world credit system.  They get to be like normal businesses and apply for SBA loans etc etc.  They can  get leases without extreme deposits, insurance, regular business banking services. Decriminalizing means access to the worlds financial networks; to date large institutions couldn't touch them because of the federal criminal statute... that'll be gone with the MORE Act. Then GS, BAC, all the big money regulated funds will be able to invest...  That's alot of sideline money that has been waiting to get into a currently all cash market...

&amp;#x200B;

That's a great meal, but what about the sides... on the side?  Well... How about taxes...?  The government just gave away 6 trillion, and shut down all the businesses that PAY for that 6 trillion.  Dems are in charge... they love dope and taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, and the cherry...  Kamala Harris sponsored the bill as a Senator.  With a 50/50 Senate, the VP is the chair of the senate; she can add things to the agenda.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh ya... and TLRY merging with APHA (Aphria, biggest in Canada).  M&amp;A getting started in the marijuana world... TLRY is going to be AMZN, GOOG, FB, WMT... buying the little fish.

145,2021-03-03,"Sure. No prob. Thank u for the question. When I was a boy in...

So I have 20x shares of AMZN that I bought at $1600, expecting a $100 profit on each (short term). Then stock plummets 25% cause of Fed statement or Trump announcing the China Trade War. At this point, best advice was on Reddit: ü¶ç hold. 

But I sold all. üòì Instead, if I sold 5 shares, I reduce overall risk of more losses, but also hold for the bounceback. Superstition says stock will rise after I sell my 5! ü§£ But here's where this is NOT financial advice: selling a good stock was bad overall because it did go back up. And sometimes stocks move like an underhand throw (NOT like a professional baseball overhand) - u buy, it crashes down, and then swoops back up above ur purchase price!

For me, I deal with extreme fear by selling small portion. 9/10 times, its a bad move for me, as patience &amp; holding would have yielded better returns. There are exceptions: Movie Pass.",RelicArmor,wallstreetbets,145.0

11,2021-03-07,"When I started investing, I lost a shitton of money.  Years ago after several years of savings and investments, I had a 70K account. I yolo'd all into barely out of the money calls on a stock I thought had dipped for unjustified reasons.  I was right and would have made money, but I paper handed out and instead ended up losing 40K of my bankroll.  It was devastating.  That was years of gains gone in less than a day.  I put down trading for 6 months or a year and thought my dreams of making huge tendies were over.  

I kept saving money and just reading about stocks, derivatives and just financial news in general.  I tossed my 30K into AMZN and NFLX and just let it sit.  

Kept saving and with huge gains from amzn and nflx all of a sudden, I had 400K 6 years ago.  Some more trades here and there and now I'm at 2.5 million only 4 years later (it would have been way more had I been more aggressive in my positions.  I'd call my trading style mostly retarded with a significant dash of boomer caution).  

Don't ever give up.  If you take a loss, you are just paying the market.  Losses may seem extreme but remember - I went down to 30K, invested in a boomeresqe manner and made it up to 2.5M in just over 10 years.  You can do that too - especially with all these financial crisis and inflation bubbles all over the place.

Finally REMEMBER!  Most people are not even aware of the stock market as an out to the bad aspects of their life.  They just think it goes up 8% a year and discount that as not being enough to really impact their life when in fact, it is one of the few ways Plebs like us can get a piece of the pie.  If your attempt at doing that fails, then you are just back where you were, working your job like 95% of your co-workers who have their money in mutual funds.

46,2021-03-08,"GameStop (GME) said Monday that Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen is chairing a new committee geared toward transforming the retailer into a technology business. The stock is soaring.

GameStop (GME) said the board of directors formed the strategic planning and capital-allocation committee that includes Cohen, former Chewy (CHWY) executive Alan Attal, and Kurt Wolf. Cohen, and Attal joined the board in January, along with Jim Grube, another former Chewy executive. Wolf, managing member and chief investment officer of activist investor Hestia Capital Management, was elected to GameStop's(GME) board in June 2020.

GameStop (GME) made headlines earlier this year as its shares turned parabolic amid massive interest from both retail traders, battling with hedge funds that were betting on its price to fall. The moves were likely supercharged by options activity and the stock's sky-high short interest. The company had been looking to reinvent itself for years, which included a reboot outlined in 2019 with goals of cutting costs and forging a stronger digital presence.

About a year ago, GameStop(GME) stock was cheaper than a Happy Meal. But as the summer wound down, Cohen helped spark a rally by building a stake in the company and later urging the board to better embrace digital offerings to better compete with e-commerce giants like Amazon.com(AMZN) .

In the weeks after Cohen and his associates joined the board, GameStop(GME) transformed into a cultural battleground where retail investors rallied around the stock seeking to thwart hedge funds betting it would fall. The stock flew to as high as $483, before falling back to Earth. But shares have rebounded quite a bit in recent weeks. GameStop(GME) stock is up 25% to $171.65 in Monday morning trading, while the S&amp;P 500 index was up 0.8%.

GameStop (GME) said the committee will hone in on ways to transform the retailer into a technology business by looking into operational objectives, capital structure, and allocation priorities.

Based on GameStop's(GME) timeline, the committee was formed earlier this year. Following the committee's formation, the company said it appointed a chief technology officer, hired executives to lead a customer care and e-commerce fulfillment, respectively, and announced the planned departure of Chief Financial Officer Jim Bell. Barron's reported at the time that Bell's departure was prompted by the company's desire to find an executive with a more technology- focused background.

Cohen and his colleague's pedigree competing with Amazon(AMZN) in the online pet-retail business could bode well for the company's future. But the stock has soared beyond even the most optimistic analyst expectations. The company still faces challenges to its physical disc businesses that have been accelerated by the pandemic.

* GameStop(GME) builds on Monday's 40% surge

* Indexes up: Dow 0.74%, S&amp;P 2.01%, Nasdaq 4.10% (Updates prices, adds analyst comment)

By Herbert Lash and Karen Pierog

March 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks advanced on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq jumping about 4% to recoup its losses from the previous session, as U.S. bond yields retreated and investors scooped up battered technology stocks.

Tesla Inc (TSLA) jumped about 19%, while Apple Inc(AAPL) , Amazon.com Inc(AMZN) and Microsoft Corp(MSFT) gained between 3.3% and 4.4% after sharp losses in recent weeks as a rise in yields raised concerns over their high valuations.

News that a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package was nearing final approval sparked a spike in yields on Monday, pushing the tech-heavy Nasdaq to end more than 10% below its Feb. 12 closing high, confirming a correction for the index.

U.S. 10-year Treasury note yields eased to as low as 1.523% after hovering near 13-month highs of 1.613% in the prior session. Longer-dated yields have jumped over the last month as investors price in a faster-than-expected economic rebound and higher inflation.

The market is adjusting to the new level in interest rates, said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York. Companies whose products and services are in demand when the economy is doing well, known as cyclicals, and small-cap stocks will outperform this year, she said. Tech will end the year higher but not be the leader as it was in the past year's rally.

""Today the 10-year is down a bit, and that takes pressure off valuations, so tech is performing well,"" Hooper said. ""The market is just about getting comfortable at this level of rates.""

Rising interest rates disproportionately hurt high-growth tech companies because they are valued on earnings expected years into the future rather than profits earned in the short term.

""Potential headwind for the market is (when) interest rates rise further from this point over the short period ... since they have risen too fast in too little time,"" said Michael Sheldon, chief investment officer at RDM Financial in Westport, Connecticut.

By 2:50 p.m. ET (1950 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 234.05 points, or 0.74%, to 32,036.49, the S&amp;P 500 gained 76.96 points, or 2.01%, to 3,898.31 and the Nasdaq Composite added 517.57 points, or 4.1%, to 13,126.73.

The rise in Treasury yields has accelerated a rotation from ""stay-at-home"" winners to stocks primed to benefit from an economic reopening, setting the blue-chip Dow on pace to end at a record high on Tuesday.

While the Russell 2000 growth index jumped over 3.2% on Tuesday, compared to a 0.7% rise in Russell 2000 value index , it has sharply underperformed its value counterpart since the start of the month.

Shares of Tesla surged 19% on Tuesday, rebounding from a deep sell-off and putting the automaker on track for its largest one-day gain in nearly eight years.

The global economic outlook has brightened as vaccine rollouts gain speed and the United States launches a massive new stimulus package, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development said, hiking its 2021 growth forecasts.

The Democrat-controlled U.S. House of Representatives will take up the relief bill on Wednesday, with the chamber's expected approval leading to President Joe Biden's signing the legislation into law later this week.

The bank index dropped 0.39% after vaulting to a new 14-year peak. Economy-linked financials, materials and industrials hovered near record highs.

GameStop (GME) was up 22%, building on Monday's rise of over 40% on the video retailer's e-commerce strategy and speculation that small investors will pour stimulus checks into markets.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.31-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.58-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

* GameStop(GME) builds on Monday's 40% surge

* Indexes up: Dow 0.53%, S&amp;P 1.49%, Nasdaq 3.17% (Adds comment, details; updates prices)

By Shashank Nayar and Medha Singh

March 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks advanced on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq jumping over 3% to recoup its losses in the previous session as U.S. bond yields retreated and investors picked up battered technology stocks.

Among the biggest boosts to the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq were Tesla Inc(TSLA), Apple Inc(AAPL), Amazon.com Inc(AMZN), Facebook Inc(FB) and Microsoft Corp(MSFT) jumped between 2.4% and 7.2% after sharp losses in recent weeks as a rise in yields raised concerns over their high valuations.

Signs that a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package was closing in on final approval sparked a spike in yields on Monday, pushing the tech-heavy Nasdaq to end more than 10% below its Feb. 12 closing high that confirmed a correction.

U.S. 10-year Treasury bond yields eased to 1.54% after hovering near 13-month highs of 1.613% in the prior session. Longer-dated yields have jumped over the last month as investors price in a faster-than-expected economic rebound and higher inflation.

Higher yields can weigh even more on tech and growth stocks with lofty valuations, as they threaten to erode the value of their longer-term cash flows.

""Tech stocks are overdue for some kind of bounce after the downfall they have had so far with most investor maintaining a positive outlook (on them) in the medium to longer term,"" said Michael Sheldon, chief investment officer at RDM Financial in Westport, Connecticut.

""Potential headwind for the market is if interest rates rise further from this point over the short period... since they have risen too fast in too little time.""

At 9:59 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 168.01 points, or 0.53%, to 31,970.45, the S&amp;P 500 gained 57.06 points, or 1.49%, to 3,878.41 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 399.55 points, or 3.17%, to 13,008.71.

The rise in yields has accelerated a rotation from ""stay-at-home"" winners to stocks primed to benefit from an economic reopening, helping the blue-chip Dow hit an intraday record high on Monday.

The global economic outlook has brightened as vaccine rollouts gain speed and the United States launches a massive new stimulus package, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said, hiking its 2021 growth forecasts.

The U.S. House of Representatives could approve the relief bill as early as Tuesday, with a vote allowing the Democratic president to sign the legislation into law later this week.

The bank index dropped 2% after vaulting to a new 14-year peak. Financials and energy sectors were in the red.

GameStop (GME) was up 18%, building on Monday's rise of over 40% on the video retailer's e-commerce strategy and speculation that small investors will pour stimulus checks into markets.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 3.2-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

* Yields lower after 10-year Treasury note auction

* Indexes up: Dow 1.67%, S&amp;P 0.88%, Nasdaq 0.17% (Adds House vote, comments)

By Karen Pierog and Herbert Lash

March 10 (Reuters) - The S&amp;P 500 rose on Wednesday and the blue-chip Dow hit a record high after tepid consumer prices data for February calmed inflation worries and legislators gave final approval to one of the largest economic stimulus measures in U.S. history.

A rotation into sectors such as energy and financials continued, both in small- and large-cap stocks, as investors bet on consumer spending when the U.S. economy reopens and sold the big tech names that have fueled the rally since last March.

Accelerated coronavirus vaccine rollouts and a monster fiscal stimulus on the horizon have raised bets on higher inflation, triggering a spike in Treasury yields that pushed the Nasdaq down as much as 12% from its Feb. 12 record close.

Meanwhile, Wednesday's $38 billion 10-year Treasury note auction, which was met with modest demand, pushed the benchmark yield to a session low of 1.506%.

The ""market seemed nonplussed and Treasuries rallied but that didn't seem to give a boost to tech (stocks),"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.

Rising yields had weighed on technology shares that rely on cheap funding for growth.

The U.S. Labor Department released data that indicated the core consumer prices index, which excludes volatile items such as food and energy, rose less than expected last month.

Investors are shifting funds from tech stocks with lofty valuations to other groups, such as energy and financials, that are undervalued and more of a play on an improving economy in a post-COVID world than big tech is, said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.

""It is occurring in fits and starts,"" Tuz said. ""That is essentially the overwhelming theme in the market right now and it probably will continue until these things run their course.""

The move away from Apple Inc(AAPL), Amazon.com Inc(AMZN) , Facebook(FB), Tesla and Microsoft Corp , all down on the day, included a rotation into small-cap stocks, which rose 2.0%, or double the gains of the S&amp;P 500.

Also helping lift stocks are analysts who have raised their estimates for U.S. corporate profitability this year following surprisingly strong fourth-quarter earnings and growing optimism about an economic rebound.

By 2:41 p.m. ET (1941 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 531.85 points, or 1.67%, to 32,364.59, the S&amp;P 500 gained 33.96 points, or 0.88%, to 3,909.4 and the Nasdaq Composite added 22.29 points, or 0.17%, to 13,096.11.

The Nasdaq extended gains in choppy trade after logging its best one-day percentage jump in four months on Tuesday.

The sweeping $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives gave President Joe Biden his first major victory in office.

Some of the $1,400 in payments heading to most Americans could end up in the stock market and could provide a boost for GameStop(GME) and other stocks popular among retail investors active in online social media forums.

Trading in GameStop(GME) was volatile with the stock at times poised to set the videogame retailer on track for its longest streak of daily gains in six months and extending a rally that has already doubled the company's market value.

Among other ""meme"" stocks, Koss Corp(KOSS) climbed 49%.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.86-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.67-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

53,2021-03-10,"March 10 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks jumped on Wednesday with the Dow hitting a record high, as data showed underlying consumer prices remained tepid in February, easing concerns about a spike in inflation.

The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield slipped from its session highs as data showed core consumer prices index, which excludes volatile items such as food and energy, rose less than expected last month.

Focus is on an auction of U.S. 10-year and 30-year debt later in the day for clues to where yields in the recently volatile market may be headed.

""Expectations for near-term inflation to rise is going to remain due to the huge public borrowings, but the tame inflation data that has come today would definitely drive some optimism among investors,"" said Arthur Weise, chief investment officer at Kingsland Growth Advisors in New York.

Accelerated vaccine rollouts and a new hefty round of fiscal stimulus on the horizon have raised bets on higher inflation, triggering a sharp rise in Treasury yields that knocked off the tech-heavy Nasdaq about 7% from its Feb. 12 record closing high.

The United States plans to double its order of the single-shot Johnson &amp; Johnson(JNJ) coronavirus vaccine, procuring an additional 100 million doses, a White House official said on Wednesday.

The Nasdaq extended gains after logging its best one-day percentage jump in four months on Tuesday, helped by a near 20% jump in Tesla Inc's(TSLA) shares as investors picked up momentum stocks that had recently taken a beating due to higher yields.

Amazon.com Inc (AMZN), Microsoft Corp(MSFT) and Tesla extended gains by 0.8% and 4% from the previous session, while economy-linked industrial and financial stocks jumped more than 1% each.

* GameStop(GME) set for longest winning streak in six months

* Futures up: Dow 0.55%, S&amp;P 0.40%, Nasdaq 0.59% (Adds comment, details; updates prices)

By Medha Singh and Shashank Nayar

March 10 (Reuters) - Major U.S. stock indexes were set to open higher on Wednesday after data showed underlying consumer prices remained tepid in February, easing concerns about a spike in inflation as an economic recovery gathers momentum.

The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield ticked lower as data showed core consumer prices index inflation rose less than expected as demand for services including airline travel gradually picked up.

Focus is on an auction of U.S. 10-year and 30-year debt later in the day for clues to where yields in the recently volatile market may be headed.

""Expectations for near-term inflation to rise is going to remain due to the huge public borrowings, but the tame inflation data that has come today would definitely drive some optimism among investors,"" said Arthur Weise, chief investment officer at Kingsland Growth Advisors in New York.

At 8:52 a.m. ET, Dow E-minis were up 176 points, or 0.55%, S&amp;P 500 E-minis were up 15.5 points, or 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 E-minis were up 75.5 points, or 0.59%.

Accelerated vaccine rollouts and a new hefty round of fiscal stimulus on the horizon have raised bets on higher inflation, triggering a sharp rise in Treasury yields that knocked off the tech-heavy Nasdaq about 7% from its Feb. 12 record closing high. The Nasdaq logged its best one-day percentage jump in four months on Tuesday, helped by a near 20% jump in Tesla Inc's(TSLA) shares as investors picked up momentum stocks that had recently taken a beating due to higher yields.

Apple Inc (AAPL), Amazon.com Inc(AMZN) and Microsoft Corp(MSFT) extended gains slightly from the previous session, while economy-linked industrial and bank stocks including Boeing Co(BA), Morgan Stanley(MS) and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co(JPM) also added between 0.8% and 1.2%.

- The pro-forma float of TSLA is 771m shares [2] - but at least ~130m of that is locked up by S&amp;P 500 index funds, ~90m by options market makers for current delta hedging requirements: 220m shares or 28% of the float is already locked up today - effective float is 551m shares or lower.
- Due to TSLA's +1,000% rally in 2020 options market makers are net long TSLA by tens of millions of shares - so the delta hedging effect of put contracts doesn't show up in the regular short interest as it normally does for other names. Much of the effective short interest is ""hidden"" by this temporary artifact.
- So if we plug these numbers in: with TSLA starting at $661 if we have a major rally due to the Q1 results (TSLA already up +7% today) then we have 44m shares equity short and market makers lock up another ~100m shares during the rally just to delta-hedge the millions of puts and millions of calls.
- The delta hedging by market makers is anti-dilutive, just like short covering: it removes shares from the effective float. Anti-dilutive buy-to-cover is much stronger buying pressure than the typical trader-to-trader buying, because it contracts the float. 
- So should most Tesla shorts want to cover (not all: some are price insensitive hedges), they have to compete with the delta hedging of market makers (and regular bullish buyers): there's a combined buying of 144m shares on a 20% move, against an effective float of 551m shares. **That's an effective short interest of 26%.**
- A short interest of 26% for a low-float megacap like TSLA is excessively high compared to other megacaps: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT and GOOG short interest is all below 1%, and their options open interests are an order of magnitude smaller than that of TSLA. [4]  [5]


I.e. the Tesla shorting that drive the price down from the $900 ATH to the current $661 is an ***excessively*** overcrowded short trade, with over $30b value at risk - which they'd want to cover much faster than any GME short position.

So a significant TSLA ""synthetic short squeeze"" is possible IMO, driven in part by excessive short options bets.

Should after the record quarter TSLA rally beyond $900 price levels to new ATHs, then all bets are off.

Licensing revenue wasn‚Äôt zero this quarter.  
Far from it.  It was merely down.

Chen said we could assume that the deal will be replaced by $100M in annual revenue.

As a result, using a discount rate of 10%, HRs saying that the all in deal is worth around $1B.

If day half is up front and half is along the 7 year tail, it could be something like $650M up front and upto $100M annually for 7 years thereafter.  (Ballpark, discounted over 7 yrs)

This is still an amazing chunk of change, obviously, and will help them fuel marketing and IVY initiatives which are the REAL investment here.  

Also, as with any parent portfolio, most patents are trash / worthless.  Max 10% have any value and 10-50 (in messaging, networking, etc) that are super valuable in that they are worth defending through litigious processes.  

All in all, GREAT post, rival.  
$BB will a late 2021 story as it‚Äôs core businesses (cybersecurity / IVY develop), but this patent sale will be the one large catalyst between now and then.

Of course it is. Either shortly through the squeeze or long through organic growth as GME becomes the next CHWY. Do you know the CAGR of gaming vs pet food? ü§î

Apparently. You acknowledge they do so what other explanation is there? 

&gt; Because it makes me money.

Sure, like you said youve made some crumbs here and there but I would bet your over all portfolio isnt that great nor is it as good as it could be without the market being manipulated. 

You make crumbs but you could have the whole thing if it wasnt rigged to just give you crumbs stupid. hahahahah

I mean, you brought it up.

Correct. The fish could eat a lot more and not have to depend on the shark to drop crumbs lmao

23,2021-05-03,"I think you have confused some numbers here. Specifically, when you see ""cost of revenue,"" that does **not** include ""mitigating losses and covering for overhead costs."" It means the cost just of the items that produced the revenue, nothing else.

For 2020, MVIS had total revenue 3.1m, with a cost of 1.4m and thus a gross profit of 1.7m. The ""overhead,"" however, was 15.8m (split as $5.9m general and 9.8m R&amp;D). 

Combine those together and you get gross profit 1.7m *minus* operating expenses of 15.8m for an operating income of -14.1m.

NOK's operating income in 2020 was 2,060.8m. By these measures, NOK blows MVIS out of the water.

Truth is, this isn't a good way to value MVIS anyway. If you are buying MVIS, you are absolutely, totally, completely not buying it based on its current financials. It is not a ""value"" stock, it is a ""growth"" stock.

Usually, when looking at growth stocks, you start with the revenue. You want to see rapid growth of revenue or at least the potential for it.

Over the past five years, MVIS has had revenue per share of $0.28, $0.13, $0.20, $0.08, and	$0.02. This is not inherently a problem, but it is when the stock is trading at $13.86. Pick any number you want from those prior years, this is still a multiple over 50. For the most recent year, it's well above 500.

For comparison, TSLA had a revenue per share of $33.80 last year, and it trades at $684.90. A multiple of 20. (That's high, and more a ""growth"" valuation than a ""value"" one. NOK, for example, has a multiple right around 1. AAPL is around 8. AMZN is around 4.) Still far below MVIS.

Truth is, MVIS already has ""growth"" priced into it. Lots and lots of growth. Like &gt;100% compounded annual growth of revenue. That's a problem for anyone buying now.",StoicKerfuffle,wallstreetbets,23.0

28,2021-05-03,"There has always been infinite risk with SI. In a fair came if the shorts get caught without their pants then they have to pay up and if the buyers refuse to sell it is not collusion. If there is enough retail that out numbers institutions by a significant margin and the institutions ell and retail doesn't then retail is in control of the price. It's how the game works and has always worked. Yes, the government may come in and do manipulation but ultimately that will undermine the markets. 

There is a very good chance that GME could go to 10k a share under the right set of events. The only question is if those events will occur and no one knows that. Regardless, GME is work at least 1k a share(or soon will be) and if TSLA can be worth 1.5k a share(when you factor in splits) and AMZN 3k etc. then GME can be worth 1k easy.

But given the SI we could easily go to 10k if the SI is several hundred % then that could be 100k, if it is several thousand then it it could be 1M.

In a fair game it doesn't matter what the hell you think. If shorters are forced to cover and can't they \*must\* increase the bid until they can.  It's that simple, doesn't matter if it's $1 or $1T dollars. Note I said \*FAIR\*. Clearly the markets are rigged so who knows what will happen.",EternalDissonance,wallstreetbets,28.0

41,2021-05-06,"What I did was a pure gambling (that's why the name of this sub is wallstreetbets). I bought 10 call contracts of AMZN for $10.678 each around 9:33 am. At that time of my purchase, AMZN stock price was about $3250 and the strike price of the call contracts was $3300 that expires tomorrow. What that means is I speculated that by 4:00 pm tomorrow AMZN will be over $3300 and I paid $10.678 premium per share for that contract. Remember that each contract is my privilege to buy 100 shares of AMZN at 3300 per share. Now if AMZN closes at $3400 tomorrow then I can buy 1000 (10 contracts \* 100 shares) shares of AMZN for only $3300 per shares. Which means I will profit 100\*1000=100K minus the total premium of 10.67K (roughly 89.33K). 

Keep in mind that, most people do not have that kind of money to buy 1000 shares of AMZN and most don't buy these contracts with an intention to buy the underlying stocks.

Now, around 9:38 am, after 5 minutes of my purchase of these contracts, AMZN stock price moved up to about 3270. That's a increase in $20 per share which caused my contracts to increase their value to $18.69. Which means a $20 increase in underlying stock price increased the value of the contracts by $8. In order to understand why only $8 but not $20 you have to understand how these contracts work. Anyways, at that time I sold them at $18.69 per contracts resulting in a total of 18.69K (10 contracts \*$18.69 per share\*100 shares)(remember I paid 10.67\*) netting a total profit of $8K.

I could also make money by buying 1000 shares of AMZN at $3250 per share but that would need me to invest 3.25 million dollars! With that $20 per share price increase I could make 20K instead of 8K but duh! I do not have 3.25 million dollars. Even if I had I would not just buy that many AMZN shares just to make 20K (That's just 0.61% vs 80% that I made).

So far what I have wrote was all good but imagine AMZN went down by 20 in that 5 minutes. In that case I could lose around 70-80% in that 5 minutes! And that happened as many times as I made profit if not more. 

TlDr: I risked $10.6K for some AMZN options expiring tomorrow and got lucky with timing a.k.a gambling paid off. Do not even think about doing this kind of trade with this kind of capital unless you have a clear understanding of how options work. May be try buying a SPY call or put contracts with the same strike price as the SPY price and observe how the value of the contract move with the movement of SPY price.",Start155,wallstreetbets,41.0

1,2021-05-08,"It feels a lot like Feb 2000, when the dot com bubble was about to burst. I was in the thick of it... I was running a startup hoping to IPO, and I had dozens of friends who were paper millionaires with their stock options, and most wound up worthless. I started with $5k in 1998, and by 2000, I had over $200k in my Schwab account. I thought I had cracked the code, and I was feeling pretty invincible.

In Feb 2000, I shorted some tech stocks, then bailed when they kept going up and took my losses. As the bubble started to burst, I put all my money in ""safe"" profitable tech stocks (Cisco, Oracle, Network Solutions and Intel). A month later the bottom fell out. It was a roller coaster ride, with enough ups to make you think it was coming back. My ""safe"" stocks lost a bundle. I rode two companies into the ground, and lost 90% on others. 

Today, Cisco and Oracle are worth less than they were 21 years ago. Despite consistent earnings increases, they never grew into those valuations. (Yes, I wish I had put everything in AAPL, GOOG and AMZN instead).This market feels ""frothy"" (to quote someone smarter than I am). There will always be winners and losers, but when the market loses its collective mind every time someone says ""inflation"" or ""tightening"" it's concerning.

Added some Clne positions will add more next week if it looks like it has found a bottom but down 50% on Sept $12s.

Jumped into Pltr $22C for May 14th and 21st.  Bleeding.  I should have put stoplosses on it but thought it would go up more the next day.  Saw the exit at about 15% gain but let it ride next day. Lesson learned, always stoploss to secure profit, minimize loss. Hoping for a solid Monday or I will have to cut losses.

Already been in Baba for a while running PMCC, going to expand position and be careful of how far otm the CC are in case it runs.

Same with Aapl.

Added some CAT today.  Going to set stoploss on Monday and see if it will run anymore.  Saw that you just exited. Even right now.

Added KMI, seems to be solid.  PMCC on this one because is seems to be a tortoise stock (slow and steady) with good gains already.

On the wrong side with Tsla, TSM, Pton, Twtr (after drop).  Looking to exit about where you want to short it. TSM seems to be a good PMCC stock because it just hangs around $115 to $122.

Planning to add ON Long and some shorts on PCG, Dash, Bynd, Afrm, Cisco, QS next week.

Also saw a comment earlier that ZM is a buy under $300 but I have been bleeding on it the last week just got out yesterday. Looks like it is in a downward trend down.

Rather than day trading, I would suggest investing in one of these three:

\-The S&amp;P 500, DJIA, or Nasdaq indexes through some sort of ETF. Will not get you as much money but you WILL get money. There is limited risk, limited return.  
\-The most established companies that are undervalued. Right now AMZN and other ""big tech/big growth"" stocks are undervalued. They are good companies. They are growing. They will go up eventually. Probably not the most cool way to get rich but you will get money.  
\-Dividend paying stocks. Find a good, stable company like Prudential Insurance that has a higher dividend yield, high dividend growth (10% a year is great,) and limited risk of going bankrupt. When the next crash comes around, put your money into it and set it to reinvest dividends. 20 years later you will have money.  
\-Everything I just said is more nuanced than it sounds so make sure to do your own research

- Puts on AMZN when it was at $280 LOL.

- Puts on GME when all you dumb fucks were playing chicken with hedge funds. Didn‚Äôt even manage to make anything on that and it seems obvious.

\* Gaining more size and scale, thereby putting $WBA ina much more competitive position with $CVS

\* Giving Walgreens a PBM in Rite Aid's Elixir group that would help WBA gain more prescription drug business share compete more successfully in that category

24,2021-06-03,"Today, June 3, 2021, CFRA Research, an independent research organization, issued its latest report concerning Rite Aid ( RAD ):

***""We lower our opinion to Hold as RAD shares are approaching our price target after appreciating over 15% over the past few days, seemingly benefiting from the short squeeze occurring throughout the market on equities with relatively high short interest. RAD's short interest as a percentage of float is approximately 15% but was over 20% for most of 2020. We keep our 12-month target at $23 and our estimates unchanged. On a separate note, media outlets have reported Amazon is looking to increase its physical drug retail business to compete head on with CVS, Walgreens, and RAD. While this would certainly intensify the competitive landscape, we think it will take AMZN considerable time to compete on the same scale as the incumbents since there are over 20k pharmacies among CVS, WBA, and RAD vs. only 350 Whole Foods locations if AMZN were to start at its grocery stores. It would make more sense for AMZN to acquire a regional drug retailer like RAD to quickly establish a physical presence.""***",Michael_Therami,wallstreetbets,24.0

Feeling down about the direction of the stock lately? Rubbish and here is why. Take note that I have no idea what I'm doing and draw crayon charts in my spare time. Not financial advice!

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at the current state of shares available this puppy is ready to pop off and its just a matter of time regardless if your involved or not.

&amp;#x200B;

There are many times that people predict a massive  short squeeze and people just promote random things like naked short selling but this is not what is going on here.

&amp;#x200B;

Let us begin with the short interest.

&amp;#x200B;

Shares outstanding: 148.28M

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tc4kmuor2j471.png?width=417&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a204002ce04dd1642212eec53dda172e7e4e48a

24% held by insiders:

&amp;#x200B;

[148.28\*0.24 = 35.58M ](https://preview.redd.it/2cpb1uew2j471.png?width=412&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94be5b644b244611024f78b04c1c4092ac91f516)

&amp;#x200B;

Shares short May 28th: 41.27M

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i8rkb6wg3j471.png?width=416&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47667ee19ed85fa4f22ad25f0394cfd60ebc5318

shares outstanding - insider shares = 112.70M

&amp;#x200B;

Normally we would look at this and say welp 112.70M - 41.27M = 71.43M shares floating around and this would be very difficult to force a squeeze on as GME had maybe 50,000 shares available during its last squeeze with the proper adjustments in place.

&amp;#x200B;

However things get very interesting :)

When you look at how many shares are held by institutions the number is 106.25%

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yjw2ov134j471.png?width=293&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47cb4e09df5cd1dc0b9fb20688ba4efd5ce50486

This is obviously highly irregular. Say you look up a regular stock like AAPL, you will find % owned by institutions is 58.69%, AMZN is similar at 59.32%.

&amp;#x200B;

With this said, this implies that 148.28m\*1.0625 = 157.54m shares are owned by institutions ü§™

&amp;#x200B;

We already discovered that there are only 71.43M shares available. This can only mean that there are 86.11M shares that are literally duplicates in some way.

&amp;#x200B;

Investopedia explains that this could be due to a delay in updates:

https://preview.redd.it/tpwqaojk5j471.png?width=389&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a3459037db015ae822d59d6bdd6f65976c88ef1

BUT investopedia also explains that another reason can  be short selling between investors:

https://preview.redd.it/1rjkf9vo5j471.png?width=390&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=869c35c00bae406a644381caa41fc9f587ce2cbb

&amp;#x200B;

They give a good  explaination to follow this up with:

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/ask\/answers\/07\/institutional\_holdings.asp](https://preview.redd.it/t6fkyizv5j471.png?width=398&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d3a792721f7063e9abb3d267fa0f677c809de10)

&amp;#x200B;

The only real question at this point is if this is a data error or if there are legitimatley all these borrowed shares. If we put this in the context of the float it looks even worse because institutional ownership is revealed to really be 148.28m/112.70m = 131.57% of the float!

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since the hedgies got caught with their pants down on GME with what turned out to be 140% of the shares shorted, this could be a telling sign that the same setup actually exists and is being cleverly hidden if you don't do the math on it.

&amp;#x200B;

With all the popularity around CLOV there is absolutely no wonder at all why the stock had such a massive 80% plus spike the other day. The reason is Delta.

&amp;#x200B;

As fellow degenerates purchase everything from FD's to long calls, they are requiring someone on the other end of that contract to purchase the delta in shares. Why? This is called  delta hedging. I'd hate to reduce it to this but its literally in the name of ""hedge fund"".

&amp;#x200B;

Example. Stock xyz has a delta of 0.25 and you want to write a bunch of calls on it because well it cant go tits up. So you end up writing 10 call options. You total delta is 2.50. This translates to around 250 shares (0.25\*10\*100) needing to be bought to cover. This is an algo thing at this point in the stock game and so generally this hedge is just written into the systems.

So our hedgie buys 250 shares, writes their calls and everythings great. Then the nightmare happens that all call writers hate, the stock starts to upswing and swing up sharply. Your delta increases and NOW you HAVE to buy whatever the upswing in delta is. If delta moves to 0.75, to stay delta neutral you must purchase 500 shares (0.75-0.25\*10 call options =500 shares ).

&amp;#x200B;

What we saw when this thing started to take off is delta screaming higher. I know that its around 0.55 right now for the short term options and up to around 0.61 for the leaps.

All in all considering that supposedly 71.43M shares are available, this seems slightly impossible for the stock to have rallied that hard and how is all the volume even possible if everything is not borrowed so heavily?

https://preview.redd.it/mhiffcbf9j471.png?width=1118&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8ac73194aa022959e1d847367209c845c958ddf

&amp;#x200B;

745.60M shares traded hands. Even at the open at $16.60, this equates to $12,376,960,000 in dollars spend and that is being extremley extremely conservative.

So why is the stock down af these past 2 days? Well because someone fell asleep at the wheel and is now trying to avoid another GME and AMC fiasco. Trust me when I say someone on the other side of this stock is having sleepless nights. I'm entirely convinced that there are no shares available at all and data backs me up on this too.

You will notice that from this chart there are only 300,000 shares available. Remeber the delta at 0.55? Well this means 55 shares must be bought for every  contract so if anyone purchases 5,454.54 contracts then there would literally be no shares available.

The very next day after this the stock came down from a gap up to 10 to about 9 and then BOOM breakout happens that very Monday and Tuesday (even wednesday at open really). They had to put out the fire and this is why the stock came down at all is the shorts trading all these shares between themselves. You'll notice however this is a very expensive endeavor as the fee is 117%. If they do not put this fire out now, this stock is going to cause billions and billions and billions of losses for hedgefunds and they do not want another bust to go down.

Just for a little sprinkle on top, BOA just downgraded the stock today with essentially reasoning that it looks too high ü§® the ol bad news to drive the stock down is going to backfire.

TLDR

CLOV does not have any available shares, every options contract you buy forces hedge funds to purchase 55 more shares. There are at best 300,000 shares available just off the June 3rd low of only 15,000 shares being available and if 5,454.54 contracts (which anyone can do that math that even a small whale could make this occur) are bought there would no more shares from this standpoint either.

Feeling down about the direction of the stock lately? Rubbish and here is why. Take note that I have no idea what I'm doing and draw crayon charts in my spare time. Not financial advice!

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at the current state of shares available this puppy is ready to pop off and its just a matter of time regardless if your involved or not.

&amp;#x200B;

There are many times that people predict a massive  short squeeze and people just promote random things like naked short selling but this is not what is going on here.

&amp;#x200B;

Let us begin with the short interest.

&amp;#x200B;

Shares outstanding: 148.28M

shares outstanding - insider shares = 112.70M

&amp;#x200B;

Normally we would look at this and say welp 112.70M - 41.27M = 71.43M shares floating around and this would be very difficult to force a squeeze on as GME had maybe 50,000 shares available during its last squeeze with the proper adjustments in place.

&amp;#x200B;

However things get very interesting :)

When you look at how many shares are held by institutions the number is 106.25%

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yjw2ov134j471.png?width=293&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47cb4e09df5cd1dc0b9fb20688ba4efd5ce50486

This is obviously highly irregular. Say you look up a regular stock like AAPL, you will find % owned by institutions is 58.69%, AMZN is similar at 59.32%.

&amp;#x200B;

With this said, this implies that 148.28m\*1.0625 = 157.54m shares are owned by institutions ü§™

&amp;#x200B;

We already discovered that there are only 71.43M shares available. This can only mean that there are 86.11M shares that are literally duplicates in some way.

&amp;#x200B;

Investopedia explains that this could be due to a delay in updates:

&amp;#x200B;

The only real question at this point is if this is a data error or if there are legitimatley all these borrowed shares. If we put this in the context of the float it looks even worse because institutional ownership is revealed to really be 148.28m/112.70m = 131.57% of the float!

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since the hedgies got caught with their pants down on GME with what turned out to be 140% of the shares shorted, this could be a telling sign that the same setup actually exists and is being cleverly hidden if you don't do the math on it.

&amp;#x200B;

With all the popularity around CLOV there is absolutely no wonder at all why the stock had such a massive 80% plus spike the other day. The reason is Delta.

&amp;#x200B;

As fellow degenerates purchase everything from FD's to long calls, they are requiring someone on the other end of that contract to purchase the delta in shares. Why? This is called  delta hedging. I'd hate to reduce it to this but its literally in the name of ""hedge fund"".

&amp;#x200B;

Example. Stock xyz has a delta of 0.25 and you want to write a bunch of calls on it because well it cant go tits up. So you end up writing 10 call options. You total delta is 2.50. This translates to around 250 shares (0.25\*10\*100) needing to be bought to cover. This is an algo thing at this point in the stock game and so generally this hedge is just written into the systems.

So our hedgie buys 250 shares, writes their calls and everythings great. Then the nightmare happens that all call writers hate, the stock starts to upswing and swing up sharply. Your delta increases and NOW you HAVE to buy whatever the upswing in delta is. If delta moves to 0.75, to stay delta neutral you must purchase 500 shares (0.75-0.25\*10 call options =500 shares ).

&amp;#x200B;

What we saw when this thing started to take off is delta screaming higher. I know that its around 0.55 right now for the short term options and up to around 0.61 for the leaps.

All in all considering that supposedly 71.43M shares are available, this seems slightly impossible for the stock to have rallied that hard and how is all the volume even possible if everything is not borrowed so heavily?

&amp;#x200B;

745.60M shares traded hands. Even at the open at $16.60, this equates to $12,376,960,000 in dollars spend and that is being extremley extremely conservative.

So why is the stock down af these past 2 days? Well because someone fell asleep at the wheel and is now trying to avoid another GME and AMC fiasco. Trust me when I say someone on the other side of this stock is having sleepless nights. I'm entirely convinced that there are no shares available at all and data backs me up on this too.

You will notice that from this chart there are only 300,000 shares available. Remeber the delta at 0.55? Well this means 55 shares must be bought for every  contract so if anyone purchases 5,454.54 contracts then there would literally be no shares available.

If you dont pay attention to anything else in this post, this section is the crux of everything.

&amp;#x200B;

There were only 15,000 shares availbe on June 3rd and on June 2nd the day before, the stock flew up from below 8 to over 9

https://preview.redd.it/ugymy575bj471.png?width=189&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88f0de6930bbabfb2ee55b7671009806fc27f315

The very next day after this the stock came down from a gap up to 10 to about 9 and then BOOM breakout happens that very Monday and Tuesday (even wednesday at open really). They had to put out the fire and this is why the stock came down at all is the shorts trading all these shares between themselves. You'll notice however this is a very expensive endeavor as the fee is 117%. If they do not put this fire out now, this stock is going to cause billions and billions and billions of losses for hedgefunds and they do not want another bust to go down.

Just for a little sprinkle on top, BOA just downgraded the stock today with essentially reasoning that it looks too high ü§® the ol bad news to drive the stock down is going to backfire.

TLDR

CLOV does not have any available shares, every options contract you buy forces hedge funds to purchase 55 more shares. There are at best 300,000 shares available just off the June 3rd low of only 15,000 shares being available and if 5,454.54 contracts (which anyone can do that math that even a small whale could make this occur) are bought there would no more shares from this standpoint either.

Trust me when I say someone on the other side of this stock is having sleepless nights. I'm entirely convinced that there are no shares available at all and data backs me up on this too.

You will notice that from this chart there are only 300,000 shares available. Remeber the delta at 0.55? Well this means 55 shares must be bought for every  contract so if anyone purchases 5,454.54 contracts then there would literally be no shares available.

The very next day after this the stock came down from a gap up to 10 to about 9 and then BOOM breakout happens that very Monday and Tuesday (even wednesday at open really). They had to put out the fire and this is why the stock came down at all is the shorts trading all these shares between themselves. You'll notice however this is a very expensive endeavor as the fee is 117%. If they do not put this fire out now, this stock is going to cause billions and billions and billions of losses for hedgefunds and they do not want another bust to go down.

Just for a little sprinkle on top, BOA just downgraded the stock today with essentially reasoning that it looks too high ü§® the ol bad news to drive the stock down is going to backfire.

TLDR

CLOV does not have any available shares, every options contract you buy forces hedge funds to purchase 55 more shares. There are at best 300,000 shares available just off the June 3rd low of only 15,000 shares being available and if 5,454.54 contracts (which anyone can do that math that even a small whale could make this occur) are bought there would no more shares from this standpoint either.

Looking at the current state of shares available this puppy is ready to pop off and its just a matter of time regardless if your involved or not.

&amp;#x200B;

There are many times that people predict a massive  short squeeze and people just promote random things like naked short selling but this is not what is going on here.

&amp;#x200B;

Let us begin with the short interest.

&amp;#x200B;

Shares outstanding: 148.28M

shares outstanding - insider shares = 112.70M

&amp;#x200B;

Normally we would look at this and say welp 112.70M - 41.27M = 71.43M shares floating around and this would be very difficult to force a squeeze on as GME had maybe 50,000 shares available during its last squeeze with the proper adjustments in place.

&amp;#x200B;

However things get very interesting :)

When you look at how many shares are held by institutions the number is 106.25%

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yjw2ov134j471.png?width=293&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47cb4e09df5cd1dc0b9fb20688ba4efd5ce50486

This is obviously highly irregular. Say you look up a regular stock like AAPL, you will find % owned by institutions is 58.69%, AMZN is similar at 59.32%.

&amp;#x200B;

With this said, this implies that 148.28m\*1.0625 = 157.54m shares are owned by institutions ü§™

&amp;#x200B;

We already discovered that there are only 71.43M shares available. This can only mean that there are 86.11M shares that are literally duplicates in some way.

&amp;#x200B;

Investopedia explains that this could be due to a delay in updates:

&amp;#x200B;

The only real question at this point is if this is a data error or if there are legitimatley all these borrowed shares. If we put this in the context of the float it looks even worse because institutional ownership is revealed to really be 148.28m/112.70m = 131.57% of the float!

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since the hedgies got caught with their pants down on GME with what turned out to be 140% of the shares shorted, this could be a telling sign that the same setup actually exists and is being cleverly hidden if you don't do the math on it.

&amp;#x200B;

With all the popularity around CLOV there is absolutely no wonder at all why the stock had such a massive 80% plus spike the other day. The reason is Delta.

&amp;#x200B;

As fellow degenerates purchase everything from FD's to long calls, they are requiring someone on the other end of that contract to purchase the delta in shares. Why? This is called  delta hedging. I'd hate to reduce it to this but its literally in the name of ""hedge fund"".

&amp;#x200B;

Example. Stock xyz has a delta of 0.25 and you want to write a bunch of calls on it because well it cant go tits up. So you end up writing 10 call options. You total delta is 2.50. This translates to around 250 shares (0.25\*10\*100) needing to be bought to cover. This is an algo thing at this point in the stock game and so generally this hedge is just written into the systems.

So our hedgie buys 250 shares, writes their calls and everythings great. Then the nightmare happens that all call writers hate, the stock starts to upswing and swing up sharply. Your delta increases and NOW you HAVE to buy whatever the upswing in delta is. If delta moves to 0.75, to stay delta neutral you must purchase 500 shares (0.75-0.25\*10 call options =500 shares ).

&amp;#x200B;

What we saw when this thing started to take off is delta screaming higher. I know that its around 0.55 right now for the short term options and up to around 0.61 for the leaps.

All in all considering that supposedly 71.43M shares are available, this seems slightly impossible for the stock to have rallied that hard and how is all the volume even possible if everything is not borrowed so heavily?

&amp;#x200B;

The only real question at this point is if this is a data error or if there are legitimatley all these borrowed shares. If we put this in the context of the float it looks even worse because institutional ownership is revealed to really be 148.28m/112.70m = 131.57% of the float!

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since the hedgies got caught with their pants down on GME with what turned out to be 140% of the shares shorted, this could be a telling sign that the same setup actually exists and is being cleverly hidden if you don't do the math on it.

&amp;#x200B;

With all the popularity around CLOV there is absolutely no wonder at all why the stock had such a massive 80% plus spike the other day. The reason is Delta.

&amp;#x200B;

As fellow degenerates purchase everything from FD's to long calls, they are requiring someone on the other end of that contract to purchase the delta in shares. Why? This is called  delta hedging. I'd hate to reduce it to this but its literally in the name of ""hedge fund"".

&amp;#x200B;

Example. Stock xyz has a delta of 0.25 and you want to write a bunch of calls on it because well it cant go tits up. So you end up writing 10 call options. You total delta is 2.50. This translates to around 250 shares (0.25\*10\*100) needing to be bought to cover. This is an algo thing at this point in the stock game and so generally this hedge is just written into the systems.

So our hedgie buys 250 shares, writes their calls and everythings great. Then the nightmare happens that all call writers hate, the stock starts to upswing and swing up sharply. Your delta increases and NOW you HAVE to buy whatever the upswing in delta is. If delta moves to 0.75, to stay delta neutral you must purchase 500 shares (0.75-0.25\*10 call options =500 shares ).

&amp;#x200B;

What we saw when this thing started to take off is delta screaming higher. I know that its around 0.55 right now for the short term options and up to around 0.61 for the leaps.

All in all considering that supposedly 71.43M shares are available, this seems slightly impossible for the stock to have rallied that hard and how is all the volume even possible if everything is not borrowed so heavily?

&amp;#x200B;

745.60M shares traded hands. Even at the open at $16.60, this equates to $12,376,960,000 in dollars spend and that is being extremley extremely conservative.

So why is the stock down af these past 2 days? Well because someone fell asleep at the wheel and is now trying to avoid another GME and AMC fiasco. Trust me when I say someone on the other side of this stock is having sleepless nights. I'm entirely convinced that there are no shares available at all and data backs me up on this too.

You will notice that from this chart there are only 300,000 shares available. Remeber the delta at 0.55? Well this means 55 shares must be bought for every  contract so if anyone purchases 5,454.54 contracts then there would literally be no shares available.

If you dont pay attention to anything else in this post, this section is the crux of everything.

&amp;#x200B;

There were only 15,000 shares availbe on June 3rd and on June 2nd the day before, the stock flew up from below 8 to over 9

https://preview.redd.it/ugymy575bj471.png?width=189&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88f0de6930bbabfb2ee55b7671009806fc27f315

The very next day after this the stock came down from a gap up to 10 to about 9 and then BOOM breakout happens that very Monday and Tuesday (even wednesday at open really). They had to put out the fire and this is why the stock came down at all is the shorts trading all these shares between themselves. You'll notice however this is a very expensive endeavor as the fee is 117%. If they do not put this fire out now, this stock is going to cause billions and billions and billions of losses for hedgefunds and they do not want another bust to go down.

Just for a little sprinkle on top, BOA just downgraded the stock today with essentially reasoning that it looks too high ü§® the ol bad news to drive the stock down is going to backfire.

TLDR

CLOV does not have any available shares, every options contract you buy forces hedge funds to purchase 55 more shares. There are at best 300,000 shares available just off the June 3rd low of only 15,000 shares being available and if 5,454.54 contracts (which anyone can do that math that even a small whale could make this occur) are bought there would no more shares from this standpoint either. There is bad news about CLOV all of a sudden and this is no accident at all!

Feeling down about the direction of the stock lately? Rubbish and here is why. Take note that I have no idea what I'm doing and draw crayon charts in my spare time. Not financial advice!

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at the current state of shares available this puppy is ready to pop off and its just a matter of time regardless if your involved or not.

&amp;#x200B;

There are many times that people predict a massive  short squeeze and people just promote random things like naked short selling but this is not what is going on here.

&amp;#x200B;

Let us begin with the short interest.

&amp;#x200B;

Shares outstanding: 148.28M

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tc4kmuor2j471.png?width=417&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a204002ce04dd1642212eec53dda172e7e4e48a

24% held by insiders:

&amp;#x200B;

[148.28\*0.24 = 35.58M ](https://preview.redd.it/2cpb1uew2j471.png?width=412&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94be5b644b244611024f78b04c1c4092ac91f516)

&amp;#x200B;

Shares short May 28th: 41.27M

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i8rkb6wg3j471.png?width=416&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47667ee19ed85fa4f22ad25f0394cfd60ebc5318

shares outstanding - insider shares = 112.70M

&amp;#x200B;

Normally we would look at this and say welp 112.70M - 41.27M = 71.43M shares floating around and this would be very difficult to force a squeeze on as GME had maybe 50,000 shares available during its last squeeze with the proper adjustments in place.

&amp;#x200B;

However things get very interesting :)

When you look at how many shares are held by institutions the number is 106.25%

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yjw2ov134j471.png?width=293&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47cb4e09df5cd1dc0b9fb20688ba4efd5ce50486

This is obviously highly irregular. Say you look up a regular stock like AAPL, you will find % owned by institutions is 58.69%, AMZN is similar at 59.32%.

&amp;#x200B;

With this said, this implies that 148.28m\*1.0625 = 157.54m shares are owned by institutions ü§™

&amp;#x200B;

We already discovered that there are only 71.43M shares available. This can only mean that there are 86.11M shares that are literally duplicates in some way.

&amp;#x200B;

Investopedia explains that this could be due to a delay in updates:

https://preview.redd.it/tpwqaojk5j471.png?width=389&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a3459037db015ae822d59d6bdd6f65976c88ef1

BUT investopedia also explains that another reason can  be short selling between investors:

https://preview.redd.it/1rjkf9vo5j471.png?width=390&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=869c35c00bae406a644381caa41fc9f587ce2cbb

36,2021-06-11,"The stock tumbled because gain on sales dropped and was expected to drop further next quarter.  This is due to lowering loan rate to take market share, and nothing to worry about.  AMZN was able to do tactics like this for decades and their investors never once got upset they weren‚Äôt showing profits as long as they continued to grow their market share.  

The only problem I have with RKT is that their management does not come out and explain or defend their company.  UWMC has done well after Q1 even though their earnings were a complete and utter miss.  The CEO coming out and explaining things about the industry and twisting the fact helped reassure investors that UWMC is a great lender.  I honestly think the mentality from RKT management is very long term and doesn‚Äôt care what the average investor thinks.  They have the track record to prove they shouldn‚Äôt be questioned.  I don‚Äôt agree with that way of thinking, but it‚Äôs pretty evident to me that RKT management knows they are holding a bag of golden eggs, and would rather short term thinkers leave the stock rather than trying to do what they can to keep them holding.  They never explained why Gain on Sales dropped last quarter and why it will drop further this quarter.  The numbers told me the that when reading the earnings report.

I‚Äôve been getting charged inactivity fees and on top of that earlier today they charged me some sort of subscription fee. These fees brought my account to $-9.....

The agency said it plans to solicit proposals from both Amazon and Microsoft for the contract, adding that they are the only cloud service providers that can meet its needs. But, it added, it will continue to do market research to see if others could also meet its specifications.

All good counterpoints, esp as relates to AMZN deal. What an investment like that shows me, however, is the potential value AMZN (through its world class DD team) sees in the potential of this company. That means something, I think, even if AMZN ‚Äî wait for it ‚Äî intelligently crafted themselves an out in the deal if material economic factors turned negative (it‚Äôs what any of us would have advised AMZN if asked). 

As for TSLA and EV, remember that (1) EV‚Äôs really pertain to cars at this point, not long haul trucks or buses, (2) we are truly decades away from having the EV infrastructure in place to truly replace gas, and (3) our power grids are still heavily dependent upon fossil fuels to charge those EV‚Äôs (coal, predominantly). Arguably, if we stood back and looked at this from a high level, we‚Äôd overhaul our grids first, but that‚Äôs a massive problem to solve; EV‚Äôs are low hanging fruit, both from an economical production and energy usage perspectives. 

We can‚Äôt go cold turkey EV from gas; just doesn‚Äôt work. Has to be a green bridge, esp as our long haul trucks and buses are concerned. Hell, if CLNE could figure out a way to make RNG jet fuel (physics and chemistry are not on their side, u fortunately), then they‚Äôd be the next AAPL as far as stocks are concerned.  

That‚Äôs not only what I‚Äôve read (there are always many sides to any argument), but what I think feels like common sense and conventional wisdom. Again, only time will tell.

Combine that with baba Bezos stepping down from AMZN which holds the option to buy the stock at that $13-whatever price (doesn't mean it has to - correct me if I'm wrong) and I think this long run may be too long.

CLNE is still IMO a long term stock, as it is a leader in a green bridge industry in our journey from today (climate destroying fossil fuel dependency) to day after tomorrow (carbon neutral/negative, sustainable and renewable sources).

66,2021-07-08,"Residential housing isn't a monolith, it's a lot of little markets.  That said, my little corner of Canada has similar problems.  However the explanations are:  


Family size is shrinking - requiring more units for fewer people.  
Units built in the last 20 years heavily favour tower-condos.  So units are also smaller.  
Boomers are healthier then their parents.  They are aging in place far longer then we all thought.  
COVID created a once in a century push to move people from city centres to everywhere else.  


One major Canadian difference is our immigration rate is pegged for 1.5% this year.  I believe that must be triple or more then the American immigration rate.  


Again, I don't know enough about america's housing market to smash your thesis, but there are so many potential holes that while I believe it's a legitimate WSB, it's just as legitimate as puts on SPCE and AMZN hoping that branson and bezos explode and shower us with tendies.",Dry_Dog_698,wallstreetbets,66.0

Bought 20x SPY 7/9 427c @ 2.91 ea. Of course, SPY is recovering quite well so far, enough for me to sell 20x of the 428c for 3.16ea.

If you want options gains stick to ol reliable:

SPY &amp; AMZN.

They both have low volatility, but large swings.

And they both have high liquidity.

Buying FD's on AMZN first thing in the morning is literally a 50% chance. You can't get better odds than that. Volatility/theta decay can't touch AMZN.

Buying long calls or puts on SPY is way better than anything you listed.

I know this because I was just beginning to invest and was watching it play out in real time. There were hundreds of companies being talked about and hyped up daily, and it was just too much to take it all in. So I stayed out. All of the technology companies, along with internet commerce, were in their infancy. The companies with an actual business model or products got dragged down with the garbage. The real legitimate companies eventually emerged as the winners they are today. As the dust began to settle I started slowly buying companies I believed in. I lost on some and won hugely on some.

49,2021-08-01,"This was your first comment BTW. 

&gt;Why would everyone think that? Amazon has sold off aggressively past two earnings, right around 7%, on great earnings. Amazon is not seeing anywhere near the revenue growth google is, and they‚Äôre trading at a far richer PE. No wonder WSB keeps fucking losing, do you pay any fucking attention?

‚ÄúYou are saying AMZN going up was obvious‚Äù- yeah buddy. Don‚Äôt start crying. I said it was a gamble on either side and you had to pick one side to make money. The OP made the wrong choice but his play was not bad. 

Why are you acting like people were expecting 8% movement on AMZN? This whole point is you making a shitting comment after the fact making others like OP feel shit for doing something retarded for what you claim to be ‚Äújust look at past and this would be easy to understand‚Äù.

If a 8% movement was something that you personally realized was possible but no way of knowing- my simple question was why didn‚Äôt you have a position on AMZN? It was a 250$ put at 3400. 

The point is not that AMZN moving down was unfathomable- the point is that unlike you who can somehow tell from ‚Äúprevious earnings‚Äù that price would go down- OP had to make a bet. It‚Äôs called Wall Street bets. 

&gt;At first glance, it appears that option traders are positioned for a negative move, as there are a greater number of put options in the open interest than calls.

Even as late as 29th, the sentiments were more puts than calls. So AMZN going down was something many people thought of. So why buy calls? Because

All in all, you don‚Äôt always have to be right. Sometimes you can give in that things are irrational or not knowable beforehand. Don‚Äôt come here and say ‚Äúwaaaaaaa AMZN was totally gonna go down cause last 2 earnings was 7%!!‚Äù Good for you but show your position.

Original Text:

After the UPS and AMZN earnings tanked, I knew that I had to chase this play.  
DASH is currently trading near its IPO level price of $180 which was established during the height of the pandemic. As more and more people start to go out and reopening is in full force we have seen a couple factors which I believe will lead to disastrous results for DASH Earnings report on 8/12.  
Less and less people are staying inside and delivery purchases have crunched. This is apparent in UPS and AMZN ERs. Reopening is in full swing. Travel is up, and people are going out shopping and of course, eating out more often as well.  
Due to reopening and increased travel, oil prices have continued to rise, up about 15% from May this year. This results in less incentive for people to be DASH drivers as they have to pay for their own gas. Not only that, the US is currently in a labor crunch, with service industries desperately trying to increase their staff by offering higher wages, which stiffens DASH's competition for labor. DASH will have to follow up with paying its drivers more or raising fees.  
All leading to horrid results, and that not even accounting for the inflated stock price, which compared to competitors like Just Eat Takeaway (who recently acquired Grubhub and aiming for aggressive US expansion) is trading multiple amounts greater that it should.

You're using trailing p/e to value a company with revenues growing more than 50% per year? What is this? Value investing for retards?

All growth companies look ""stratospheric"" by trailing p/e, because investors are buying future performance, not past or present. These companies deliver slim-to-zero earnings today because they reinvest their cash flows so they can deliver exponentially greater earnings tomorrow.

Was AMZN stratospherically overvalued when its p/e hit 3600 in 2012? Its shares are worth 13x more today.

Were SQ, SHOP, and ROKU astronomically overvalued in 2019 when their p/e ratios were all infinity? They've all become multi-baggers since.

139,2021-08-03,"You need to break down AMZN down into its segments. AWS and Prime make up the bulk of their profits. E-commerce and warehousing do not make as much but the structure of the business is quite different to WISH. 

I would say that WISH is disrupting Dollar Tree, Thrift/Novelty shops. Wish has a lot of unique items that you won't find anywhere else.

I am very bullish. They utilize customer payments and long shipping times to effectively get free financing for their operations so in the long run they won't need capital to keep the business running. Right now they have a huge marketing spend so you want to watch that along with MAU growth, and perhaps AOV if that info is published.

The biggest threat to WISH is not AMZN but BABA. AliExpress sells a lot of similar products, they own Cai Niao which is basically like the global version of Amazon warehouses on steroids. Their goal is to get the majority of packages delivered from the warehouse in China to your door in 72 hours. I have used both Wish and AliExpress recently, and AliExpress had gotten a lot faster, whereas my Wish producs never arrived and I had to apply for a refund.

I am long both WISH and BABA, but WISH has a lot in the works (private label through Wish Select, free shipping through Wish Access, etc) which can make them competitive. PT: $69",quaeratioest,wallstreetbets,139.0

33,2021-08-04,"Legit answer here: your stock picks are shit. If you are trying to gamble your positions are awful because you're basically playing roulette and betting on green when the payout is 0.2 to 1 if it hits. If you literally pick all WSB stock picks you are actually a retard chasing after the train after it's already left the station, or going to your local palm reader for financial advise.

My suggestion, throw a decent portion of your portfolio (25%-50%) at FAANG (FB, AAPL, AMZN, NFLX, GOOG) or similar stable high growth stocks in long-term (5 to 35 year holdings) long positions and you can play with the rest IF you are legit trying to invest. If you're trying to gamble use options so at least you can feel like you're in Vegas and lose just as much money twice as fast, my suggestion is starting with ITM call spreads for bullish and ITM put spreads for bearish until you get a feel for market trends, press releases, earnings reports, etc. I would almost always suggest to NEVER do OTM weeklies unless you know damn well what you're doing since that is normally just throwing money at the wind. But if you want to be a true WSB autist this is the way, everyone goes through that phase and some of us never leave and just eat -100% every friday.

3,2021-09-02,"Sell way OTM CCs on stocks you already own, so like 30 delta at most but 15 delta is safer and probably free money.  PMCC underlying should be the same criteria as if you wanted to just be long on the stock itself but the long call is cheaper than the stock so you can play on shit you couldn't afford to just buy 100 shares like AMZN, TSLA, etc.  

&amp;#x200B;

If you want a better strategy than the wheel, what I do is size my position in 200-share minimum size and then buy-write 100 shares with a CC and then a CSP for the other 100 shares, so basically a covered strangle.  Profits from both sides of the wheel, is as directional as you want it to be (but generally directional with positive delta), and captures profits from gains in the underlying instead of fucking right off with those like if you're just selling a CSP with the wheel.  If you get assigned on your CSP, then switch to just CCs.  If you get assigned on your CCs then either go back in or switch to another underlying.  I might get assigned on MARA if it keeps going up, but if so then I'll get assigned at 43 where my entry was 30 and my adjusted basis is probably closer to 25 so that's not bad for 6 weeks or so on a single position in a $10k account (actual account is closer to $35k but I'm pretending it's only $10k so I can practice this shit without blowing up my account).  This strategy ONLY works because we're in the longest bull market in history, but because of that I want to be more directional.  If we get into a crash, then chase your underlying down with CCs and roll to 50 delta every time your CCs hit like 80 delta to lock in the intrinsic in the contract for a small additional profit.  Also sell call credit spreads as it falls and buy back in at the bottom with all the premium you made during the fall.  On the way up, put credit spreads and CSPs will make you more money.  If it stays at the bottom, then condor the fuck out of it and set a limit buy like $1 below your short call so you can turn that shit into a covered call and a long call; if it drops then just take assignment on the short put if you like the stock.  


For PMCC, the good part is you can use it on stocks you can't afford so NVDA, AMD, TSLA, AAPL, MSFT (premium is shit though), FB, etc.  It's also a much more efficient use of capital than an actual CC with the stock in terms of your ROC since you can hold more positions (so trade more positions but trade smaller; read up on the Kelly Criterion for gamblers to figure out position sizing).  With 10k I'd recommend 3 positions with a maximum of maybe 4 or 5 positions at most.  With any options selling strategy, your goal is to get rich very slowly but consistently.  Aim for like 1% per week and you'll do fine.",professor_jeffjeff,wallstreetbets,3.0

Also competing with AMZN in damn hard being local doesn't do shit as AMZN has made a successful entry into Indian markets beating out local competitions. CPNG just isn't too large enough to beat out local competitions in the few Asian developed countries. And BABA is going to dominate the rest of the Asian countries.

Your universal statement is already disproven. We can keep going until you admit it.

Whats ironic here is that even the unoriginal companies have grown larger than the original companies. 

https://marketrealist.com/p/amazon-amzn-stock-vs-alibaba-baba/

‚ÄúAnother interesting data point we can look at is the total profitability. In the last fiscal year, which ended on March 31, 2020, Alibaba posted a net profit of $19.8 billion. The net profit is expected to increase to $28.5 billion and $34.6 billion in fiscal 2021 and 2022, respectively.

While Amazon‚Äôs market capitalization is over twice Alibaba‚Äôs market capitalization, it actually generates fewer profits. Amazon generated an adjusted net income of $11.6 billion in 2019, which is expected to rise to $17.7 billion in 2020 and $23.7 billion in 2021. It's worth noting that Amazon‚Äôs fiscal year is the same as the calendar year. This doesn't impact our thesis that Alibaba generates more profits than Amazon.‚Äù

33,2021-09-07,"I would argue a couple things.

1. You mention trading volume as a statistic, but it makes sense that passive funds (long term buy and holds) make up a small amount of the volume. The whole idea is minimal work in managing funds which means less trades. What is more concerning is what is the percentage of stock holdings are in funds rather than institution holds. If the majority of the money are index funds then we could have a bubble
2. While you mention that big tech accounts for 23% of the s&amp;p, I would say big tech performs astronomically well since they always bring great returns and any analysis on them turns out well to be true. They drag along the rest of the market and as a result buying a fund pushes the price up on other companies that might be less deserving of a stock price raise. Hence the bubble, not because of tech companies (if tech companies are a bubble thats a whole nother discussion), but on companies that no one would ever buy normally if it weren't bundled in a fund.

I personally don't think the tech rally will ever come to a close. Its pretty clear that tech drives the market in terms of growth and value as opposed to other companies in the sp500. Tech maybe speculative, but blue chips like amzn, appl, etc are as is big too fail unless we get some monopoly busting going on.",tacobff,wallstreetbets,33.0

Not a fair comparison though. 


4800 at expiry is more fair to compare. The spread above would profit 190% because capped. OP would profit 267%. 


The spread above is just a random example. You‚Äôd have to figure out where you think it will be and then adjust your spread accordingly to maximize. 


Just something to consider. Also, you can use these spreads to enter an AMZN call position much cheaper by having a narrow spread. You don‚Äôt get max upside but more than you would with just shares. 


For example. Back to $4,000 by end of year, you could do what Op did but they costs $100k+. If you don‚Äôt even have $20k for one option, then you could 3700/3800. Cost is $3k and upside at $4000 at Dec is 150%. This would be on Jan expiry.",Green_Lantern_4vr,wallstreetbets,23.0

What happened was that all analysts did not expect them to report direct contracting (which is basically a close to zero margin revenue anyway) under their books for this quarter. The analysts only were estimating insurance premiums to be booked under revenue which they actually over shot by about $2M, so were basically right on.

Regardless, CLOV still had negative Gross profit (meaning CLOV was losing money before spending a dime on SG&amp;A, R&amp;D or other ‚Äúspend money to make money‚Äù items on the income statement), which is an awful sign for a company that has been operating for about 6 years now.

To put this into perspective, since you like TSLA, TSLA was gross margin positive by the end of its second year (2009) and has been positive ever since. AMZN has also been Gross Margin positive since it‚Äôs second year of operations. 

Being gross margin negative this late into its lifecycle is a really bad sign, even if revenue is growing really fast. I can go out and sell new iPhones for $200 and i will make a bunch of revenue, but does that mean i‚Äôm a good business?

5,2021-10-03,"Problem with TSLA is not that it can actually manufacture good cars and will have a good market share; it's just that it's traded as a tech, AI, robotics, insurance, energy, transportation on any given day.

So the narrative - if it solely focused on cars would have had a different effect on stock price. You see, while TSLA actually has good margins, manufacturing has limitations in that it can grow proportional to the capex you put in (i.e. factories that cost $billions). 

Most tech companies on the other hand do not need incremental costs/capex to grow their userbase/revenue and so this is where exponential growth story comes from. If you apply this to TSLA, while it has indeed grown 50-60% from last year, jumping from 500k cars to 800k cars is one thing, whereas jumping from 5m to 7.5m is another.

So therefore the problem is that TSLA is ALREADY priced as if it has dominated the world and so while demand is gonna be there, I don't think it can grow as fast in the next few years simply because economies of scale and network effects are different when producing cars.

That's why every couple of months the narrative shifts to AI, FSD, insurance, robots or whatever that may be. Remember when the stock rallied in December people thought TSLA would grow this year by 2x and produce 1m cars. Now that it's not happening, the stock will probably go even higher than where it was last December and this is where some eyebrows from skeptics should be raised. 

If you give iPhone the example, Apple did not become a trillion dollar stock UNTIL it really did dominate its segment with zero competition, AMZN did not become the behemoth it is today BEFORE cloud/prime and all of that, Facebook did not become where it is today befoe IG exploded and so on.

So you have to understand there is an ex-ante factor on one hand, and there is ex-post in the other. TSLA is priced as if everything people thought it could achieve already happened. This is what I disagree with.",Henkss,wallstreetbets,5.0
6,2021-10-03,"The most important question (at least for me) is: DO they really have to compete with Amazon and the rest? It seems to me they are not targeting the same market, so to speak. 

I hope this IKEA-Metaphor might help me demonstrate:   

You know IKEA right? The omnipresent Swedish furniture store. I imagine AMZN and the rest being the furniture sold. It's mostly a purchase you deliberately think about before doing so. It's an ""I definitely need an XY and maybe some XYs""-kind of purchase. WISH are the little, ridiculously cheap kind of products lying in bins around the furniture. It's a purchase you don't really think about since its so cheap but that is enticing nonetheless. Additionally, people get creative with those cheap products. They re-use them for different purposes. 

The problem with the wish-app right now is not that the customers don't want these cheap products, more that they don't actually see what they get. Pictures are usually awful and rarely represent the product as it is. Delivery time still problematic as well.",wheeler786,wallstreetbets,6.0

19,2021-10-04,"Just feels like we need to see a much bigger pullback for things to seem like they're priced reasonably, but who knows whether that will happen.

Our last major pullback was of course 12 months ago... at SPY 355-360.

We just topped around SPY 450-455 a month ago.  Just an unreal 25+% run over the past 12 months.

I'd feel really good about buying if we dip into the sub-400 range, but it'll probably require us to see an actual debt default in 2-3 weeks to reach that level (who knows whether that will happen, those types of ""debt ceiling"" events have always been overhyped, but maybe not this time).

More importantly than that, a lot of high growth stocks have been consolidating all year and if that happens to big tech for an extended period of time, we could see a bigger 6-12 month sideways range (like we saw from mid-2015 to mid-2016 during that taper tantrum/interest rate hike/debt ceiling episode where S&amp;P 500 didn't have a new high for almost a year).  Probably worth at least considering how we should trade if that comes to pass.

How would you trade if MSFT/AAPL/GOOG/FB/AMZN are basically range bound for 12 months and then maybe only banks and some re-opening plays and smaller value caps are moving up.

It's worth at least planning for a ""sideways"" year like that as markets absorb tapering + interest rate hike expectations to come.  Going back and looking at stocks in 2015-2016 and how they traded is a worthwhile idea.",zg44,wallstreetbets,19.0

12,2021-10-06,"Yes. It also is usually a good indicator of potential volatility. 

Like I said, the market average PE is 15-18x. So you can think of a company that is above 18x PE as expensive, and a company below 15x as cheap.

The reason why a company may have an elevated PE, is that they are growing earnings, and therefore may grow into their current valuation. Higher growth translates to higher PE, and as growth slows, the PE contracts.

On the opposite side, companies with low growth opportunities (value) like NUE or VZ have below average PE ratios because they are not likely to grow, but are not usually shrinking either.

Negative PE signals either trouble, or the company is investing internally.

What you really need to understand, is that the high growth high PE names like TSLA at 403x are basically massively overvalued on the assumption that at some point in Tesla‚Äôs future they will grow their earnings 20x from what it was this year. Yes, you read that right, in order for Tesla to return to a market average people are betting that Tesla with grow earnings in the future 2000%. 

If, at any point in the future, Tesla signals that it‚Äôs growth is slowing and they will not meet that lofty 20x earning growth target, the stock will plummet. Say that happened tomorrow, (god forbid something tragic happen to Elon), a return to market average would see the share price go from $780-&gt;$40. Seriously. That‚Äôs a 95% loss.

Now, that likely won‚Äôt ever happen, and TSLA will continue to grow, but if you compare that multiple to something like AMZN with a 57x PE, AMZN looks a lot cheaper, and a return to market average would be roughly a 65% loss.

25,2021-10-07,"While your product arrived good, WISH got a reputation very early on for having shitty products. I don't know how true this is, I've never personally used WISH before, but getting to the point where the company becomes a meme/punchline isn't very good. Additionally, this is anecdotal, but my step brother was offered a job at WISH a couple years ago and turned it down because he felt the company was run so poorly.

As to why the stock has preformed so badly, I believe their last earning report showed they are still struggling to be profitable. Also, lots of e-commerce stocks have taken a beating after earnings. Lower growth expectations, good earnings that still fell short of predictions, bad earnings, and the idea of e-commerce slowing as things reopen post covid, valid or not, along with supply chain issues are all contributing factors here. Just look at the pounding that CHWY and even fucking AMZN have taken lately. If Amazon is taking it on the chin, WISH will probably get ass raped.

You might get lucky and catch a pop sometime that will allow you to exit with a small loss or even gains, but it's probably gonna be tough for it to get back to your cost basis, and I'm guessing you don't have much dry powder to average down with, and of course you'd need a lot to really average down.

I'd say your biggest lesson here is to use a stop loss before you get 50%/$80k down, but it's your money and your investment strategy. I'm sure you're aware of stop losses and all that shit. This is definitely some great loss porn, and since you just own shares and not options, you still have a chance here, but WISH has an ugly fucking chart and you've got a lot of ground to make up just to break even. Stranger things have happened in the market than WISH going back up above ten for sure though.

Toyota and Honda to a lesser extent will always be a big player, they do not have unions, and make quality.  They pay high, but fair wages.  And are top tier quality down to the dealers.  They all make money, because the cars are quality.  The cars are quality because they can price their reputation, save money on unions, and spend extra on raw materials.  Deliver share holder value, and have something to offer TSLA doesn not.  Ford however cant price for ""quality"" and must compete while encumbered by unions, dealers, and ever dwindling relevance.

25,2021-11-03,"I wrote this to someone so just gonna post it: 

&gt; Most likely, you have a habit of buying stocks that *seem* to be doing good, and just trying to go with the flow.

&gt;It is investment, even if retarded. For example, when I bought AMZN calls yesterday, I looked at the over all support (which was at 3301), meaning it was u likey to go below this price. AMZN was trading at 3290 when I got in- so I was secured that it would go up more likey than go down. 

&gt;Secondly, I looked at the RSI, which slows that AMZN is way oversold for the past week. It is not very likely that it will be more sold. RSI at 40 is an oversold indication.

&gt;Thirdly, looking at MACD, the signal line was still below the MACD line even after massive sell off and low RSI- this is again a bullish signal- although the MACD was much more closer and could not be used accurately here. 

&gt;Fourthly, DMA and DMI both show bullish trend as daily moving average and DMI are above the average. 

&gt;Fifth, the moving average 200 days shows 3330 yesterday but the stock was at around 3312- this gives the indication that to get to the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù- it should move up more than down. Another bullish indicator.

&gt;Sixth, BOLL shows that yesterday, AMZN was moving at slightly lower than midpoint. This is indicating that it should move up for average once again but it is totally possible for it to go down to meet the min support at 3213$, which is 100$ loss. This is neutral or bearish signal. 

&gt;All of these and and I haven‚Äôt even gotten into the candle stick. 

&gt;Yesterday‚Äôs candle stick shows somewhat similar to a Doji, which is when the stock moves sideways, or starts and ends at same price with large movement throughout the day. This usualy means that the next day, there will be a big movement- more than average. And because I had many bullish indicators, I bought calls to get the most value.",OptionLoserSupreme,wallstreetbets,25.0
26,2021-11-03,"You can get rich on puts, since markets know that put is caped at 100% loss on underlying, its leverage is also matched to follow it. But yes, calls is much more likey to make dough. 

There are ways to lose more than you are investing but if you are starting out options, you won‚Äôt even find the stredgy to do this- so you can just ignore it. 

You won‚Äôt lose more than you put in with calls or puts. 

Only 1 week because any more and premiums become way too expensive. Plus, 1 week is actual gamble while more time would mean ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù.

Amzn is at 3390$ now. 1 week play would be buying a 3500 strike call expiring 11/12 and hoping that AMZN goes up to 3500 at Friday. If AMZN gains 20$ a day, or .4%, your profit should be 5,000 next Friday. 

Good place to learn option would be to look at videos on YouTube that actually do example trades. The actual math doenst need to make sense. Just understand what strike is good (you‚Äôll get better at choosing after gaining experience (which will cost you some money from stupid trades)) and the date. 

Explanation makes options way too complicated by using Greeks and shit when non of those matter if you‚Äôre just there to gamble.

Just know this, your strike price is the bet you make. And date is the.. date. Every 1$ the stock moves above your strike, you gain ‚âà100$ per contract. Every 1%-3% movement of stock will double your money in 99% of all options (unless earnings days). 3% in Tesla will give you 50%, but 3% in GOOGL will give you 400% and 3% in SPY will give you 5000% gain.

Yeah no. When real rates are at zero, money is free. And guess what ? Everyone including their grandma puts everything they have including the Mortgage in the stock market. But here is the trick : your grandma mostly buys SPY and a bunch of boomer ETFs...

43,2021-11-05,"For those that have bigger balances, know that setting stop loss on option is almost ALWAYS BAD idea. You show be keeping track of it in a way where massive drop should be your only concern. Not slow bleed. 

For small accounts that can‚Äôt afford to lose, setting 20-30 is fine (Id say even 15% is pushing it) because options are very volatile. If you are doing it in an index, fine. But stocks- hell no. 

There are many reasons, but the main reason is- stop loss works in that when the ask price matches yours, the brokerage will sell it at the limit. But this can occur in option flash crash- which happens a LOT. 

Second reason is, any time a stock is about to move big- you will have massive option volume up tick because those buying shares will also buy leverage. This causes IV and volatile issues where your stop loss can trigger even when the price never reaches your stock limit. (This happens more with stocks with large share price like AMZN). 

I usualy look at option stop loss as exponentially to share stop loss. So for me: A 1% option loss is .1% share loss. A 10% option loss is 1% share loss. A 20% option loss is 5% share loss. And 30% option loss is 10% stock loss.  50% option loss is 30% share loss. 

Etc. so you can figure out if you want to sell by saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm down 30% down on this option but would I sell a 10% loss if I had just bought shares instead?‚Äù.

Paypal has such utility making paying easier online. Venmo is about to be profitable, and with it being on Amazon it's going to maintain these growth rates IMO.

62,2021-11-10,"Compilation from what I'm reading in this thread:

1. GME had virtually no retail competitor. There was no single video game only retailer that existed. Best Buy in the early 2000's was pretty close as it was another go to place to get games, but fundamentally Gamestop was where you went if you wanted video games. To this day there is no retailer that sells only specifically video games that has the brand recognition, name, and history that GME does.
2. The real estate that they owned was understated in their true liquidation value. As you'll see below, it is also true that their free cash flow was bigger than their market cap. This provides a nice cushion against downside risk.
3. Their price to book ratio and free cash flow provided a nice cushion of safety. I believe at one point the share price of GME was below how much dollars per share the company had if it were to instantly go out of business.
4. Management had talked within the last couple of years about how to reverse the course of the business, part of which was a conversion to ecommerce. I will be honest, with how hot ecommerce stocks got under covid (see JMIA, AMZN, SHOP), it's not surprising that this mere fact alone is probably what catapulted GME to insane gains.
5. Low market cap in general...hgh ceiling for reward potential, low loss potential (relatively speaking)

That's very insightful. **Amazon went from a low of $1.5 to $105** !! (adjusted price of course, but  60x stands) **and then crashed all the way back to $6** (down 94% from ATH,  4x from prior lows). 

That 4x sounds so reasonable and would have made so many autists happy from that point!!

This is the actual correction that signifies the end of the easy money trade and the beginning of the post-Covid trade.

The main thing to focus on right now is just what types of prices are sensible and what types of companies will do well and are priced to do well over the next 12 months and beyond.

Semiconductors, consumer staples, value stocks, growth stocks with reasonable P/S or P/E, cash generating tech stocks are where you want to be looking.

Companies with pricing power or in shortages are where you want to be.

Most important thing I have to stress is that the biggest losers of the past 6-8 weeks are likely to remain losers going forwards.  Investors (except Cathie) are rotating away from those plays.

Some of these Covid plays may not see those peaks again for years if ever.

I don't think this dip will be like the year 2000; you're not going to find an AMZN at $8 kind of deal next year... unless China starts WW3 and if that happens we all have bigger problems than stocks.
