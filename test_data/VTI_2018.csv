0,2018-01-12,"I dropped 25k in split between VTI, VOO and then a bunch of dipshit random stocks (some meme stocks, fuck you mu and others) a few months ago.

VTI and VOO are both up a bit over 7%, my dipshit stocks are doing pretty well but I did some stupid shit like panic selling while getting my sealegs.

All in all I'm up 6% in a few months and it's not huge gainz but it's also safe and still lets me mess around with smaller stuff while still having 'padding'.

You performed a linear regression of price of MU on price of SPY and the result was that there is a weak linear relationship between these two variables, i.e. one is not a great predictor of the other.

I guess you should wait for some recovery, but personally I would take 1/3 out and put it in $VOO or $VTI or $SSO or even better, $AMZN after the next big drop it will have. Set an alert on Amazon at 
$1600 and buy $50,000, then set alert at $1475 and buy another $50,000 if it ever even reaches down there.. and hold for life till you have $500,000 in 1-2 years when they take off further.",GrapeJelly33,wallstreetbets,0.0

What like broad index tickers?  How about **$VTI**, and **$TOTL** then?

Or do you want a broad range of more specific index tickers?  One of the more amusing ones that no one else here will probably suggest is **$HMLSF** an **ETF** of marijuana stocks (not doing so well at the moment though relative to where it started).

**$GDX** is fun if you like high beta, but not the pure insanity of **$VIX**.

0,2018-11-10,"Buy Shares of something $VTI or $TQQQ or $SSO  or $AMD $AAPL etc.  Don't do options at all. 

YOu will still make good on Shares when things jump too.

Also you will get margin if you put $25,000 into for example TD Ameritrade, you will get $100,000 on margin to spend on Shares.

Imagine now what you will make with $90,000 in Shares of Apple or AMD or etc.. 

Use that money on Shares with margin, not options. You will lose it with options. With shares you can just wait and you won't have to wait if you buy $90,000 of shares right after we have a huge minus Dow down 400-800 points day.

Just wait for the next big red day and then buy in slowly with like $5000 orders of shares at a time very slowly as it drops and buy more if it keeps dropping every other week.  

In 3-5 years you will have $250,000+ depending on which stock you went with and how low you bought it.
