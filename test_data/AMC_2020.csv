CONN stock

‚Äî My crystal ball üîÆ says this stock is undervalued. Also says to buy calls.


AMC stock

‚Äî 6.69 and 12% dividend. You‚Äôre getting paid to üíºhold, what a steal.

Oh what, they have a lot of debt? Like I fucking care, they own the market. ‚ÄúBut what about Netflix‚Äù? Bitch what about them doubling their revenue, what about frozen 2? Top grossing movie of all time hosted via AMC, doesn‚Äôt sound like any issues to me. They took on the debt to take over the industry and it fucking worked.

Like I give a damn if those finance nerds downgrade this shit, AMC upgraded themselves from 1 billion to 2 billion a year.

AMC might be a good option, 12% dividend and has been steadily increasing revenue over the years. The stock is quite beat down due to their debt load, but the debt was used to increase the companies revenue and devour market share so I would consider it ""good debt"".

1,2020-02-05,"I mean, that's insane expenses for what you have going on. I'm 31 and I buy my vehicles outright as I don't like payments. My hobbies include movies and gaming and travelling. AMC stubs allows me 3 movies a week or 12/month for $20. Most games I play are free, constantly updated and or I pirate. And travelling is about 3-4 times a year but nothing crazy like going to EU,NZ etc all the time so I'm not spending $5-8k per trip. 

Your children are the most expensive thing, which even you admit is inflated by the fact that you can afford to pay a premium for your quality of life/living arrangements. Plus having a $1M+ home says a lot. 80k/year for you would probably feel like becoming a poor person.

I could add two children to my current budget and still have plenty of savings/fun money if my salary went to $80k a year. But we all live different lives and have different views on what is necessary or wanted, and that's ok. 

But a majority of the US moving to $80k would dramatically change their lives. I grew up insanely poor, some people have no clue how good they have it.",Trespeon,wallstreetbets,1.0

Implied volatility was higher a month ago. Not sure if this is a market glitch or if people aren't concerned with the shares going to zero. Concern is that this leads to bankruptcy which leads to worthless shares. Their debt isn't due for years but they can't pay rent and interest payments with no revenue.

Personally, I have a shit ton of assigned shares with this company, and my thought is that the government isn't going to let companies like AMC go bankrupt that easily. Renegotiating the debt and getting government assistance seems to be the best approach for all parties involved and I would think short of the lenders losing faith in the company would want to go that route.

It could be the lenders see an opportunity to replace some of the debt with shares in exchange for a lifeline. The only thing holding down AMCs share price has been that debt.",jimbofbx,wallstreetbets,0.0

If AMC goes bankrupt there‚Äôs no doubt that there will be less movie goers simply because there are less theaters near them and their favorite one is closed. This will likely not effect an avid movie goer, but the casual once every two months movie going family is simply not going to go further out if their way to see a decent movie at a theatre they have to travel further to and are not accommodated to. If this represents 10% of American families and they cut those trips from once every two months to once every 4, then the movie studios are losing upwards of a billion dollars a year.

Do you understand what happens when a company goes bankrupt?

Their assets get sold off (usually by a restructuring firm) and the proceeds go to pay creditors.

What happens to all those assets? In this case mostly lease agreements and built out commercial real estate?

Well other people take then over! This is the circle of business.

The problem with AMC is that theatres across the US have been going bankrupt for years with no one willing to step in and take over. Theatres are dying.

So, not only will all their theatres get sold and potentially rebranded, but some of them may never re-open.

Disney doesn't need AMC to stay open. They just need theatres to stay open. It doesn't make a difference if the theatre says AMC on it or not.

Now, what Disney could do is buy up the AMC brand and their leases and call those Disney theatres and show only Disney movies in those theatres.

The only thing AMC theaters generally have going for them is location. There is no brand loyalty in that segment. Generally you're going wherever has the most convenient movie time and cheapest ticket.

Also: bankruptcies mean the company just immediately goes to $0. Equity holders get wiped out.

Realize that long term options price AMC at 50% chance of bankruptcy, which makes sense because obviously they need help as does a ton of other companies but it's not clear what that help is.

Personally, I think if government doesn't provide a lifeline here they've failed. I would hope lifeline is so generous that it makes all that leverage they racked up go away or at least be manageable, which would actually put company in a good position to succeed. Note that the company might go bankrupt but still exist after bankruptcy. 

One option - buy a long term $1 put and finance it by selling a OTM call for a net credit. this reduces your risk and still gives you upside. If stock doesn't move you're ahead because of the credit. You could even use the credit to buy a deep OTM call for cheap in case it rallies from squeeze.

Another option is to just sell shares and buy calls to reduce max loss. The stock is heavily shorted so hoping for a squeeze isn't unreasonable. That said if stock drops then rallies but below your strikes you lose.

You said it perfectly with your millionaire billionaire comment. And the reason you can‚Äôt compre this to 08-09. Those people WERE affected. For now. Currently.  They are not. 

They know there will be recovery so they are using this as a cheap buy in which is propping things up more. 

Good point about deaths too. 

If you can. I would take a little from your paycheck and buy stocks (I know that isn‚Äôt the way here. But for every yolo I have a long term position too).  

If you can. Start buying into Delta, big name casinos, penn gaming.

I was looking at the economy and saying the market has to go down, we are in some deep shit and the economy will have hell to pay.  

I started with 4k and got to 80ish k - I was ahead of everyone and even re-balanced 80% of my 401k to bonds and treasuries, well ahead of the big drop.  I bought put option on AMC, looking back I wasnt smart enough to do the SPY...LMAO - you live you learn

A week ago I was Laid Off and I am determined to grow the house money, what is now left on the table about $35k.

I got luck a few more times and got to $80k - 1/3 is already in savings and so only house money on the table. Mostly tied in puts and a few LEAPS.  My dumb luck, I have SPY puts and puts on gold, unfortunately, both went in the same direction...UP

This Chart is what caught my eye and I realized the Fed will hold the market up as long as needed and will let the economy play catch up.  They were not this aggressive previously 2008-2009 and not this quick to act.  

Holding the market up will accelerate the recovery as in keep jobs on the table?

Look at 1/3/2018 then by 12/2018 there was a huge flash crash, the Fed trend continued then 2/2020-3/2020 the market followed the Fed's balance sheet.  With the Fed's spike up via unlimited QE, we may gradually start going down but over a longer period of time and maybe not as much.  Fed acted like an Airbag.

 I fear I may not have enough time in my May-June puts.  Hence I am lowering my Put positions in those months and going to cash with a few calls.  I am not certain this will happen, but can tell there is something artificial holding this up.  Even Ackerman got out and is now bullish but isnt shouting it like he normally does on EVERYTHING. Not that I like the guy, but he seemed spooked and is refusing comments on a lot of things.  Being quiet is not his norm.

I am now looking instances in history to see how unlimited QE has worked out, not able to find anything where the QE was to this magnitude.  As I type this, I realize I found an answer to a question I have not thought to ask.   What are ALL the variables in determining why my puts could be wrong and do I understand the variables?

I am NOT saying I am right or wrong, but I found some sense of direction. 

Just wanted to share because I feel we are in the same boat and I'm in my last year of my 30's.

I dont have nearly enough savings and started late in my 401k - gotta make the best of it

I'm a self taught investor with plenty left to learn, so if you have any pointer, please share.  

Random rant: I feel our generation is one of the worst generations to be alive: Gulf War, .com bust, September 11, War in Iraq, the financial crisis, multiple large hurricanes, F5 tornadoes,  global warming and now a third recession that came with a fucking plague.

But we did get iphones and now we use them to trade stocks.

&amp;#x200B;

* Current cases are about 5-10% of the actual infections. There are tens of millions of infections world wide at the moment.
* Remdesivir works but Gilead has some trouble ramping up production. China ends up mass producing it in violation of their patent. Long GILD in the next few months but get out as soon as the FDA approval pops their stock. Buy back in when the dust clears because Gilead ends up doing really cool stuff this decade.
* Vaccines end up harder than they look and are significantly delayed. I don't recommend being part of the trial groups going on. Sorry Bill Gates.
* Contact tracing never takes off in the US but is very effective in other countries.
* Social distancing is bullshit. You're all breathing each other's air in a grocery store, for example. This virus can spread for hours inside with circulating air and the R0 value is significantly higher indoors. Social distancing is theatre. Don't touch strangers and wear a mask and goggles (yes the virus can infect you when it reaches your eyes.)
* Things aren't normal for a while. There are second waves and sometimes third waves. Yes this is the new Great Depression and consumer buying habits are permanently changed.
* Malls take an interesting twist. Lots of these end up becoming specialized apartment complexes (you'd be surprised how nice a Macy's can be restored) with some breweries and other niceties.
* AMC doesn't survive and most people start streaming movies out of their houses. Theaters that are left become novelties that stream old movies, etc, for bored people with disposal income.
* Feds never end up buying equities directly in during this crisis but they do during the next one.
* Option skew is permanently affected by this event. Much like in 1987, investors now realize that at any moment the economy can be significantly disrupted by a pandemic. OTM puts become a permanent part of many portfolio strategies. 
* Stimulus has its limits and policy makers start taking into account social unrest from governments picking winners and losers. This dramatically affects how the next financial crisis is handled.",LingeringDildo,wallstreetbets,23.0

lol this ain't some commie nation you wumao shill, people are smart enough to know property owners are not gonna eat the costs of property taxes, mortgage principal, interest, HOA fees, utilities in some cases, repairs, etc. when no rent is coming in from the other end to cover them

&gt; Can you discriminate against 50-60% of the market

I'll say yes - if not outright blackballing, certainly higher rents and fees (especially if 50-60% of landlords also get burned by previous non-payment)

it's like if 50-60% of the population suddenly got a lot sicker and had much more expensive medical costs

sure, health insurance companies aren't gonna leave out 60% of the market, but they all sure as hell are gonna charge them higher premiums to counterbalance the higher medical bill insurance payouts

But this can also go for companies that might have technically investment grade ratings but cannot receive money from the fed because the fed could lose that money, and for whatever people want to say about the fed, they cannot lose taxpayer dollars and have been expressly clear about this. That might be one holdup to the fed buying LQD. Also there could be several other factors at play. For instance, it's my understanding that the fed hasn't even issued any loans to any companies yet. That was what I was kind of alluding to in my post saying 'smart money FOMO' because everyone bought everyone else's debt, leaving the fed out of it. That would mean that the price we see now still isn't tampered with materially, other than by expectation on what the fed will do to buy it.

2,2020-05-09,"Currently September and October in the 220-240 range.  Have Junes and Julys in my portfolio that my expire worthless.  Also some August.

My current portfolio has 5/15 SPY 288 and 5/18 SPY 293 CALLS that I bought last week.
I have CSCO calls at 43, 44, 45, 46 and 50 strikes for 5/22.

I have SPY puts June 200, July 210, August 210, Sep 220 and Oct 240.
I also have various puts on some names I think will fail like PLAY, AMC, HOG and most recently GSX.  All out to at least August because I think Q2 earnings will be an absolute fucking bloodbath the likes of which this market has never seen.

The portfolio by value is about 75% put and 25% calls.

This week I will roll the 5/15 288s out to 5/22 295s probably.  I'll sell the CSCO calls on Wednesday at hopefully a nice return (Fri they were up 100%).  I will find another name to play the earnings run up with or maybe just get some more SPY weekly calls using the initial proceeds plus half the profit.  Half the profit (if there is any) will be used for more puts.  Likely Oct SPYs or more PLAY puts if they continue to rally.

28,2020-05-12,"Buy 100 shares. You can use these as collateral to sell to open a call - meaning, you're giving someone else the option to buy your shares at a set price. So, let's say you buy 100 AMC @ 3.00. You then sell a call to someone else with a strike price of 5.00. If AMC goes up and the calls ends up getting exercised, then you make the premium + 200 (because you bought the shares for 300 and sold for 200). If AMC hadn't gone up, you'd still make money from selling the call, and you would sell another call. 

After your call gets exercised, with the cash you get, you sell a put - meaning you're agreeing to buy someone else's shares at a set price. If AMC goes back down, the person exercises the put and you buy their shares for a price you are okay with. If AMC doesn't go down, then you are making money you get from selling the put. 

So, lets say you sell an AMC 4.00 put, and it ends up going back to 3.00. You have to buy 100 shares at $4 instead of $3, but you offset the cost with the premium you made selling the calls and puts. Now that you have shares of AMC, you start writing covered calls again.


I did a shit job making that concise, but

TL;DR: Buy shares. Sell calls. If they don't get exercised, you made money, keep selling calls. If they get exercised, oh well, you made money. Sell puts. If they don't get exercised, you made money. If they get exercised, oh well, you have shares that you can now write covered calls for. Repeat.",ViperApples,wallstreetbets,28.0

AMC has a couple billion in negative equity if you disregard the goodwill from their past M&amp;A. They lost 150 mil in 2019. Their leases had negative balance sheet value at the end of last year. That was all BEFORE COVID-19. If you want to think about the future, ""Trolls World Tour"" just made more direct-to-streaming than Universal expected it to make in theaters before the pandemic (and AMC's CEO threw a hissy fit in response and said they wouldn't show Universal movies any more). And AMC just issued $500 million in debt at &gt;10% interest a few weeks ago, with the first interest payment due in October.

Even if AMZN and the studios could have theaters at all, they wouldn't want all the liabilities at AMC. They would wait for it to go Chapter 11 and then either bid on the leases, or watch AMC go completely out of business and then negotiate their own cut-rate deals with the landlords (who will also be desperate at that point).

I see a lot of dumb takes on WSB, but this is pretty up there. Antitrust looks at market share within a defined market segment.  Amazon buying AMC does not change market share of movie theatre chains at all like a combination of AMC and Regal would, for example.  There may be vertical restraint arguments to make, but this the fact Amazon is pervasive across market segments does not raise market concentration issues within the movie theater market segment.",lawhoo_,wallstreetbets,106.0

What if it actually happened.

AMC is fucked - movie theaters are fucked, there is no bouncing back from this for that company :(

It‚Äôs creditors probably already have the keys or are close to it and Amazon‚Äôs deal could have been directly with them (even if not does the price matter for this resource to Amazon?) Acting now guarantees the asset and puts the process in their hands - it also ensures that AMC doesn‚Äôt try to pull some Chapter 11 bullshit  

Who else has the urban property that AMC does on that size of site across the country?

Think about where those theaters sit, just tucked far enough out of the way that getting trucks and vans in and out works

Amazon isn‚Äôt buying AMC Theaters to have a bunch of movie theaters it‚Äôs buying them for the land and to build warehouses and distribution centers on...

However, if amazon picks absorbs them simply and plays their own studio movies and the big players its likely they'll face a lot of backlash and wont be able to regain a profit.

234,2020-05-12,"Thank you for the explanation! 

My next question is how did you know it was a pump and dump?  Is that normal for news of a buyout to create some over-valuation at first (hence the ""normies will buy anything these days""), like after that initial rally there's probably going to be that little drop over the next few hours?  

I still don't have a feel for the strikes for calls and puts. I understand that the put becomes more profitable as  the stock price drops but I still don't understand how selling 100 stocks at a strike price that is sub-market value is profitable(AMC never dropped below 5.07). I've been relying on RobinHood and its fancy visuals to show me where the break even point is (Like I said, i'm an idiot).  I should probably get a real fucking education before I blow more than I'm willing to.  Time to watch a bunch of stuff on options pricing mechanics, I suppose. I should probably take my ass to /r/smallstreetbets but the real info seems to be in this sub.  

Thanks again!

1,2020-06-01,"&gt; y would it be a bad time to sell if it did drop under $5?

The $5 mark is arbitrary, but as the price moves lower towards support (for AMC ~4.60), your max gain in the premium is going down. If you think we're not going past our recent high at 5.60 for example, if you sell a 5.50 call right now you might get 10-15 bucks. If it creeps up to 5.55, but you think we'll reject and drop back down then you might be able to sell a call for 30 bucks.

2,2020-06-01,"From my training selling calls, just try not to be too impatient when selling. Consider the price action when you might want to sell, like a recent resistance, when we're trading near that level is a good time to sell calls.

I'll be honest. I'm on the verge of completely snapping.

Tomorrow I'm going to test the only remaining hypothesis left to me that isn't insane. I'm going to assume I'm genuinely retarded and that all my decision making is stupid and wrong. I'm going to full inverse myself.

Which means I'm going to make every play my old self would think is absolutely retarded.

I'm going to buy highly risky companies on the verge of bankruptcy. Go half-all-in on Hertz, airlines, cruise lines, AMC, all of it. At the same time, I will buy companies I think are retarded to buy because they are insanely overvalued. So I'll buy shit like Zoom, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, whatever.

I think all these plays are FUCKING RETARDED. But going with my ""smart logic"" hasn't been working. So we will try inversing myself and doing things I genuinely think are stupid.

If I still lose money, I will know God is trolling me specifically. If I make money, I will know I'm retarded and should never try to succeed at anything ever again. Either way the outcome will be the same.

AMC also has a big liquidity facility so they won't be forced into it soon, so the question is at what is the point their debt pile gets too big to service with future cash flow, which requires knowing both the size of the debt pile (only partially public information) and the future cash flow (unknowable).  

I sort of think future cash flow is bound to be shit given market forces, streaming services, awesome home TVs, the long awaited arrival of VR experiences, and COVID anxiety.

I timed mine really well especially with the recent bad news release. I got in and got out very quickly. I was originally going to do the same type of earnings play you are talking about but with CNK instead. But apparently they are in much better situation financially opposed to AMC. 

Im not goinng to give a definitive answer, its up to you to weigh the risks. If you truly believe that AMC will continue to drop a bit more (which it may, im not trying to talk you out of it or say it cant drop more) then go for it. One thing i will definitively say though is keep it short. Get in get out. Thats it. TAKE YOUR PROFIT dont be greedy.


Edit: maybe think about looking into a more long term play with CNK calls a few months out. Especially since youre newer to this. Its less stressful and will still give you a lot of information and learning experience.  They released earnings this week on wednesday and it actually went up afterwards. Its a very bullish stock right now. But only make this play if youre willing to buy a couple months out and be patient.

30,2020-06-04,"Anyone who thinks Amazon is interested is insane.  AMC is doomed.

Let's talk specifically movie theaters.

Movie theaters are probably the antithesis of the Amazon model.  They're super inefficient in terms of size (high rent) and use (how many seats go empty per showing per day).  It is fundamentally inconvenient to the customer as it is around someone else's schedule.  $15 bags of Skittles is not Bezos' business model.  

There is none of the convenience of on-demand streaming services like Amazon/Netflix/Hulu/HBOGo.  Your kid decides to flip the fuck out while seeing Frozen 2 in the theater?  You're SOL.  I can pause Frozen 2 at home -- I can't do that in a theater.

There is amazing content being created on the streaming services.  Netflix spent more money last year on original content than ESPN spent on live fucking sports.  The best performances are not in cinema anymore, they are in longer episodic format series.  Streaming companies can use viewer demographics and analytics to determine what is most likely to be successful content and then iterate fast on getting it to market.

The only people who still want to go to the movies are really two niche markets of ""*I want to watch this in IMAX with awesome surround sound*"" and ""*I love hippie indie flicks*"".  Amazon's only interest in owning a theater would be so they can guarantee eligibility for awards.

This is just a bigger part of the overall ""brick and mortar"" apocalypse.  It is not just retail (Macys/JCP/Sears), it is every business with large commercial real estate footprint that has high rent.  Grocery stores are another inefficient business model both from a cost perspective and lack of customer convenience.

2019 quarter end June earned $1.4 billion. This year that will be nothing. Nil.Their quarterly operating cash flows per quarter are around $200M. That will be nil for Q ending June 2020.

As at December 31, AMC had $100mil cash on hand.They will be saving on employee costs, cutting capex, etc, however they will not be saving on rent nor any prior purchase agreements made for food, etc. If they cancelled those with their suppliers then that would put a huge damper on their supply chain relationship.

Their quarterly lease costs alone are around $250 mil. AKA they cannot even pay one quarter's worth. Sure, they can defer this for a bit, but it will take a long fucking time for AMC to catch up with the payments when people will not even think about hitting the movies this summer.

&amp;#x200B;

AMC has always had an abysmal current ratio and relies on quarterly cash flows, which will not be coming in the future. Especially since around 1/4 of their revenue comes from European countries who will be slower and more prudent to reopen.

Upon imminent bankruptcy, they have $580 mil in short term lease obligations and $5B long term - those landlords might get cucked.

Add $800mil in other current debt and $4.7B in corporate borrowings, and that leaves fucking nothing for shareholders. Their asset ratio, removing a retarded $4.7B in goodwill which makes up 1/3 of their assets, is negative $3.5B.

No revenue for months.  Decreased capacity in theaters since they‚Äôll need to spread things out.  Decreased visitors (really should be no visitors but we see how stupid some people are).  
The IV on puts is double what it is on calls.  Had to laugh at people buying calls on strikes that are higher than the pre covid $7.50 a share.  The January ‚Äò21 $1 puts are selling for $0.30.  Tells you where people think this is heading.  
Their 2019 net income was ($150M).  If they lost that much last year what would they do this year?  They‚Äôll lose $750M-$1B.

Yes, that's not free money other than PPP, but EIDL and MSLP have no payments for a year. If a business can't survive with those, it was on the brink of death before covid anyways.

Sure, some business owners will be blissfully unaware of those and never talk to anyone who could tell them about those and basically ignorantly let their business die when it could've lived. I just don't think it'll end up being a lot of business owners when all is said and done.

AMC knows movie theaters in the Fall won't be back to 100%. Sure there are movies coming out in July that some expect to being 90% of foot traffick back. There is no 1 billion dollar release this year. Not one. 

So the entertainment industry data has gotten fairly good at guessing films expected opening box office returns month in advance. The data must be in for summer through fall and it must be dogshit for their financials. AMC also MUST be worried about what happens if there is a second wave during the winter, another big box office season.

This year would've still been a record even without covid, and while covid will certainly further along more closures, it's not as if these store locations in malls were doing wonderfully prior to now. It's like AMC - huge brand that may end up going bankrupt, which sounds like covid is really bad, til realizing they lost a fuckton of money last year as well and were already dying a slower death that covid simply has quickened. People don't realize there are always SOME bankruptcies that happen in the normal ebbs and flows of the economy.

While the funding measures I mentioned won't prevent them all, they will prevent a lot of ones that would've happened. Main Street Lending Program especially if it takes off. A business can literally get 6 times annual earnings in funding and not have to make any payments for a year and then interest-only payments for a year after that. You can't tell me for most small businesses that wouldn't save them. Most small businesses have at most a couple months of expenses in their bank account, and this puts 6 years of expenses in their bank account.

1. Nationalism. Whoever wins the vaccine race will keep the vaccine for its people alone first. Which is why multiple vaccines likely have to get made not just one. Getting one country vaccinated will take time and it delays the rest of the world potentially.

2. Supply and demand. A billion or more vaccines won't be manufactured very quickly. Also what will they cost? A lot of the growing permanently unemployed won't be able to afford much. Herd immunity will be costly and many Americans will refuse vaccinations because you can bet just like masks it will be politicized for no reason. It already is.

Once the multiple vaccines are found and tested, and maaaaybr ready for distribution we will probably be in Spring 2021, and then good luck administering it. Typically it takes five years to fully eradicate a pandemic through herd immunity even with vaccine development unless the virus dissapears.

Meanwhile, Covid could just mutate and we start all over. It already mutated to become more contagious once.

So don't bet on Q3-Q4 or even 2021 Q1 being substantially better. Long plays are looking worse and worse for any ""recovery"" sector stock. Companies like AMC, AAL, HTZ likely actually won't survive.

9,2020-08-05,"I'll be nice and give you the potential risk.

Universal just announced a revenue sharing deal with theaters. Basically the movie release window in theaters can be shorter and the movie theater gets some of the home video rental monies.

https://deadline.com/2020/08/cinemark-mark-zoradi-on-universal-amc-theater-window-collapse-1203003411/

So AMC and Cinemark can pump their stock by saying that they expect to get that revenue at some point. So if that happens, retards that don't understand might pump the stock.

Now do I believe this shorter window is good for theaters? No. But in a world where they are closed and any dollar is found money, getting a piece of the PVOD pie is better than an empty plate.

If a family of five looking to view this in theaters in the US is going to spend about $60 for tickets alone (based on AMC's prices [here](https://movietheaterprices.com/amc-ticket-prices/)). Then add snacks and the anxiety of finding five seats together at a new release, plus dealing with bathroom breaks. All of that is eliminated with an in-home rental and at an avg price of $6 per head is a no brainer for most families with disposable income who don't have the patience (remember, kids) to wait for the price to drop at an unknown date in the future.

6,2020-09-06,"I mean obviously revenue matters (see HTZ). But with tech you have certain catalysts propping that market up. Cloud computing and online shopping are going bananas since everyone is staying at home. Online streamers are seeing record subscribers. Many top companies are realizing their workforce could've worked from home and reduced costs all along. 

There are certainly some companies and individuals who are not taking as many risks because of the crisis. Ford just laid off over 1000 salaried workers. Cruise lines are still pushing dates back. AMC theatres are still empty. 


But I think there are a good deal who see the actions of the fed and the federal government as guarantees. Hey, take those risks, we're rigging the table to be heavily in the black. This trickles down to retail, as they watch a fire sale on stocks proceeded by ATHs. After all, if the government is going to guarantee my payroll, why not invest? After all, if the government is just going to give me $1200, why not invest in Apple? All the idiots on WSB are posting 1000% gains after all.  I think a lot of people underestimate how much retail has gotten into the game with all this free time and desperation. 

Look. I'm not saying the market is behaving rationally. I'm just pointing out how people get caught up in narratives backed by some kernels of truth. I think if you're trying to find a logical reason behind every move you're forgetting (even for a moment) that markets are heavily influenced by the  psychology of the masses and that doesn't always make sense. There are trends, and some trends have patterns. This is one that has netted me some profit: when the fed decides to prop up the market, people are generally convinced it will work. When people think things will be ok, they buy, and self fulfill their own prophecy. And the cycle continues. Sometimes this is a line of thinking taken by individuals, sometimes a firm.

The key is realizing this is incredibly risky, and catching that wild wind in your sail may tear it. But, if you can use that headwind even for a moment, you might get out before the storm. If you look at QQQ chart leading up to Wednesday, you can see it start to go parabolic. That's always a clue to me. Head over to WSB, no bears, all full retards posting unrealized gains of several hundred percent. Time to bail. 

Yeah, that's a risk, and I dont always come out on top, but I've watched this market pump past rationality and stay on that path for weeks before correcting. I've just learned to read the room amd realize when we've all moved to the same side of the boat before it tips over. Buying into the tech bubble is obviously idiotic, it's just knowing when to take profit, not being too greedy, and getting the fuck out before it pops. The key is knowing you're in a bubble and acting accordingly, and not being a full fledged moron who thinks a stock that's going parabolic will just continue to rise another 30%.",thisguy092,wallstreetbets,6.0

The company is drowning in debt and burnt through nearly 300M in cash in Q1 before the pandemic took hold completely. Since then all theatres were shuttered, it kept burning cash. They opened 70% of them recently but are heavily discounting the tickets and concessions which will no doubt hurt revenue and margins. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now the million-dollar question is, how the hell is this stock back to pre-COVID prices? Keep in mind it was failing back then too! Now with Disney releasing Mulan on its platform, other entertainment studios are bound to follow because they don't have to share half their revenues with the theatres. There is bound to be a correction prior to the election and with their earnings due on November 4th, I think it makes sense to buy the cheapest in the money puts, no way they have blowout earnings, in fact, I am confident they will miss analyst estimates by a longshot.

2,2020-10-06,"Movie theaters are not going away. It's a cash cow business and top of the food chain for studios. In 2019, there were over 1.2b tickets sold worth more than $11b in the US/Canada - more than all live sports and theme parks combined. International box office was over $30b for the first time.

The competition for movie theaters is not streaming at home, it's other going out activities. Also, no matter how good your home theater is, your 65/75/85"" TV is a speck compared to a 1,520"" IMAX screen. Any movie worth watching is worth watching in a theater.

RN there is a vicious cycle - people not going to the movies because there are no new blockbusters and studios not releasing blockbusters bc not enough people are going to the movies. AMC could well go bankrupt - that means shareholders get wiped out, debt holders take some big losses and a new AMC starts operating. it doesn't mean no more movies in AMC theaters. The probability of bk is high so buying AMC is a lottery ticket. manage your trade size accordingly.

2,2020-10-10,"I dont know if you're actually asking or just joking but ive done a decent bit or research into it that I can share. 

I'm definitely going back to the movies once things get more normal. I love the atmosphere and movie theater popcorn, going to see a hyped up movie with a theater full of fans is a fun experience in itself. Or its also fun watching a horror movie after its been out a while and only a few people are there. Also its something to do with a big family when everyone is moved out. Getting everyone together to watch a movie in a living room is a lot harder than going to a theater.

Thats all subjective though and I'm not basing these buys off of just my opinions. The average demographic for movie goers is 12-24 years old. I think those people are still going to want to go to the movies because its a popular and easy date, and people in that demographic likely don't have their own home theater setups.

I chose cinimark specifically because they have a great financial track record. AMC was billions in debt before cornavirus happened so they're struggling. Cinimark's ceo has said they have enough cash and liquidity to last them through to 2022 if they have to. They also have said that they earn profits at 10-30% capacity which they've said is easily doable even with social distancing. Their plan is also to aquire more theaters during this time, specifically by buying up theaters that have gone under and have to close for good.

I believe that their stock price doesn't reflect much, if any of this. Right now theyre almost as low as they were in march. This is due to fear of more lockdowns, movies being pushed back further or going on demand, and other chains closing doors again. 

The last bullish point that I havent looked into enough yet is that trump signed a document that gets rid of a law that's been around for 100 years. The law stopped movie producing companies from owning their own theaters. Now that thats gone, you may see Disney or other producers looking to buy a chain of theaters to own themselves. Cinimark is in the best financial spot out of all of them so I can see them being the first pick at a bid from those producers.",BadAssOrangeJuice,wallstreetbets,2.0

4,2020-11-03,"I personally believe once the pandemic is ""over"" there'll be a big jump in the entertainment industry in general. Movies, live performances, events.

If production is on hold, that means Netflix, Amazon, Disney aren't able to produce much content right now either. Netflix subscription prices are going up, Amazon Prime isn't a full membership and Disney isn't able to create as much blockbuster content then the movie studios are currently hoarding and will eventually get distributed through Netflix and Amazon. Don't forget YouTube is killing it right now also. 

Potential return on AMC is worth the gamble to throw a few bucks at it, Cinemark will for sure bounce back.",rubena619,wallstreetbets,4.0
5,2020-11-03,"Getting paid later is always a better option then not getting paid at all. 

Growing up as a teen I heard a story about Trump and Ceasars Palace in Atlantic City. Crap casino was underwater for a long time, but never went into bankruptcy (90s), because the majority of the debt was held by the banks. They never foreclosed on Trump because they would've been left with an eyesore of a property worth waaay less than what they had tied into it. 

Similar to why Hospitals will work out a payment plan instead of sending the bill directly to creditors (make more money, then selling the debt for pennies on the dollar). Similar to why during this shit show of a year, even if there wasn't payment deferral protections for jobless people, banks would be stupid to foreclose on millions of homes, being stuck with all that property to offload for pennies on the dollar. 

Some group recently floated AMC some cash. In order to protect that money they would have to float more cash. I'm sure they have some level where they will call it a wash, but if they are flush with cash, payment put off is better than no payment at all. 

Sometimes it's better to float the debt until better times show up. AMC isn't fucked because of a shitty business model, it's fucked because of a pandemic. If the pandemic was gone tomorrow they would survive again (more debt of course). 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading this ramble. 

AMC is a gamble at the moment, but honestly it's a gamble that might pay off. I mean SHIT. the premium is dirt cheap for options out to Jan 21 2022. Two years out. It's a gamble, but it's a cheap gamble. Would I pick up more than a handful of 21 Jan 22 5C; probably not. But a small percentage would be worth the pay off.

6,2020-11-03,"Thanks for the detail. I've been asking around but no one can give a good answer; PLAY had a massive spike on announcement that their creditors permitted them to issue later-dated corporate bonds to repay their current bonds and immediate obligations. That was an agreement to modify the existing covenants. I assume it's a win win for all parties involved, but it could also be a sign that the creditors are more nervous of default than the company is of getting defaulted upon. What's to prevent this scenario from playing out with all the other distressed companies of this sector? I could see it happening to cruiselines, but who knows maybe they'll give AMC another year on their maturities. I don't really want half of distressed companies to become zombies, but at the same time it's frustrating to try to devise a play when a debt reprieve or denial amplifies the movement of these already overleveraged stocks.",LehmanParty,wallstreetbets,6.0

It survived and thrived enough over the next decade to contemplate purchasing Sears for billions; ended up as  a merged instead and then it started it's decline into it's current subsidiary state. 

\----------------------

It's odd though as going forward given covid I feel like AMC is in a better position (then cruise ships). Much easier to sell a store on land then a billion dollar ship. The thing that is fucking with AMC (as they are open in some areas), is they have no new releases as studios NEED theaters filled to capacity to make up for production cost. All studios are still hesitant to release new films into the theaters until covid passes. 

If AMC wants to survive, it's going to have to come up with some sort of gimmick to constantly keep their 25%/35% max capacity seating full. Old movies wont do it.

150,2020-11-02,"So - for transparency. I am in 31K worth (now 41K+ worth) of 40Cs for May. That is just how I kind of roll though.

Honestly with NIO? You have some options, you can hope for a dip before earnings, buy Nov 20's or Decembers, and sell right before earnings (I am afraid of IV crush)

You can buy longer dated calls (Jan or later) with a 40C or more and hope for minimal IV crush and solid movement. Have an exit plan on when you will take profit. So if you say hit 100% then sell and depending on when that happens you can look for another entry point.

Currently - NIO is having solid jumps, then will consolidate and fall as the market falls. So when it first pumped from 21 to 29, it fell back down to 26 on general market down turn before another upgrade.

Earnings is 17 November AMC. Best of luck. Take my advice with a grain of salt, do your own due diligence, don't just blindly listen to me.",UnplayableConundrum,wallstreetbets,150.0

Box office doesn't exist anymore and hasn't since covid and the streaming platforms are generating consistent profits. Actors/actresses emerging on these streaming platforms as well.

Or any company can buy if amc if cheap enough and convert movie theatres into something else.

A company that can support amc until after covid-19 to make profit again, work deals, convert structures.

17,2020-11-03,"Okay, so I was a manager at AMC before the pandemic began. This company is too mismanaged to stay in business.

First of all, most of the theaters are falling apart (I'm talking about the previously owned by Carmike theaters.) They are filled with mold, old/broken equipment, etc. Before the pandemic, they already couldn't afford the necessary repairs.

Individual theaters waste way too much money when it comes to inventory. That's mostly because they've chosen bad food products to sell (i.e. stuff that goes bad quickly or things no one wants.) They also do not have enough control over spending when it comes to cleaning supplies; theaters waste thousands of dollars on unnecessary supplies, and their theaters are still disgusting. Also, the teenagers who work there are super wasteful and honestly steal a ridiculous amount of food. Oh, and projector light bulbs are $1,000+ each.

And an important point, AMC made that really bad deal with universal to only have movies play for a few weeks before it can be moved to streaming or something. That's ridiculous and is terrible news for AMC. Mostly because studios have it set to where if they have a movie playing at your theater, you HAVE to play it once every set. So if there's a movie that's been out for 2 months, you have to play it alongside the new movies. So say, in the future, a big movie comes out, but there's only 1 blockbuster and 5 older indie films. AMC can't JUST play the blockbuster-- they have to reserve other screens for the other movies. They can only give the other screens to the blockbuster at the last minute IF no one buys tickets to the indie film. But if the movies are being moved to streaming services, no one is going to opt to see the indie movie when they find out the blockbuster is sold out. Not to mention the limited seating to allow for social distancing.

The thing is, AMC was already broke before the pandemic.. The business model just doesn't apply as well as it used to. If they survive, they'll definitely have to close all the older locations. I have looked at 2020 as the ""nail in the coffin"" for AMC. They had a good 100 years of business..",madisonnhickey,wallstreetbets,17.0

77,2020-11-03,"So let me get this straight. 

You decided that since your job isn't secure, why not just buy the stock too?

I understand the film business better than you, so I know your biggest issues. One of which is that theaters usually do a lot better when it rains. However, during Coronavirus, who the eff wants to go to the theater if they'll get the COVID? So that winter attendence uptick is just fantasyland.

Beyond that all of the Studios have pushed back their tent poles so good luck selling much more than a dozen hot dogs during your prime set. Oh yeah, didn't you hear? All of those mid tier films are going directly to Disney Plus and Netflix too. So all of that ticket margin that you would have received from sucky films like Artemis Fowl, Hamilton, and Mulan from lower film rental costs are gone as well. They are Disney +'s problem now. 

AMC is just waiting until Studios start to produce films again for directly for the theaters. When they do, it'll take months before they get them filmed and through post. Then they'll probably try to cut corners on marketing spend...so it will be even slower than that. The perfect time to declare bankruptcy is right before a new slate of films hits the movie theaters, but they won't have the cash flow to last that long. 

By the way, did you see what Warner and Disney just did? Yeah, they said that the people who run their streaming services are now in charge of their theatrical production slates as well. Kilar got hired at that dumpster fire AT&amp;T Warner Blows and a bunch of digital suits are now in charge at Disney. So when a decision to greenlight the next film comes around for theaters, the digital guys probably won't care as much.

You'll know you are 100% toast when the Marvel films start going directly to Disney +. We're not there yet, but it's getting closer and closer...and you can only hold Black Widow for so long before the executives rationalize that the Disney + Sub revenue is worth it. (Not a smart decision, but I've seen dumber...and if things don't open up again next summer, Disney isn't want to hold the P&amp;A costs on their balance sheet all the way through 2022.) 

Do yourself a favor and learn how to code. Or something you can do that doesn't involve cleaning empty theaters or asking a couple of they would like to upsize their order.

It's going to be a tough couple of years. The theaters are gonna burn through captial like there's no tomorrow because landlords are beholden to their debt holders and building rents are a big part of the operating cost structure.

AMC will come back eventually. Just don't bank your financial future on it being before they declare bankruptcy or recapitalize a half dozen times.",LavenderAutist,wallstreetbets,77.0

Moderna and Pfizer will report vaccine results this month. Very likely to immediately apply for emergency authorization if remotely positive. Theater stocks are pretty much as low as they are gonna go at this point. Seems like a good risk/reward to play some OTM calls on the better ones.

Reasons this won't work: vaccine results are delayed, vaccine results are bad, AMC tanks the sector like the piece of shit that it is by going bankrupt, theaters only get a slight bump on vaccine announcement.

You see stocks like Etsy down almost 20 percent or Docusign down 15 percent in a day, do you really think the growth in those businesses is overdone or going away?",agoodnightasleep,wallstreetbets,37.0

40,2020-11-09,Yo it‚Äôs hours later but I figured I‚Äôd reply. I‚Äôm thinking AMC is fooked for a couple of reasons. First is Xmas to New Years week is 4-5% of annual box office sales. That‚Äôs out. New productions are all backed up and cancelled and postponed. Supply is dry. Plus the clear way forward for one of their major suppliers DIS is streaming. I don‚Äôt see a stimulus which specifically helps AMC coming. I‚Äôm rarely a bear but here I am.,prince-of-dweebs,wallstreetbets,40.0

You're missing the point, we're leaving the Covid market now. There is no more hunting for miracles of the pandemic. AMC was already a crappy company before the pandemic. There's no new plan or anything, just less of a chance of them going bankrupt. That's why it's sliding back now.

And the guy running the garage sale comes over and scratches off the price and says now to buy the whole company you have to buy 300 million shares instead of 137, making the new price north of a billion. And you ask him? What makes this company worth that much more, and you just shrugs his shoulders and slaps you in the face.

Yes there is value there, not nearly as much as they would have appraised for before 2020, and so therefore not enough to offset their debt.

The other studios aren't going to die on this hill to save theaters, they're going to start sending their own movies to streaming services as well. And then what? Half the customers that might have come back after a vaccine are going to stay home rather than pay 400% food markup after a $10-$15 ticket. Studios could charge 30 bucks for new releases (knowing multiple people will probably watch them together) and still make more than their previous cut of theater tickets, and as Mulan has shown, people will pay it. Hell, 30 bucks will be a cost savings for customers when they don't have to pay 6 dollars for a fucking bottled water.

9,2020-12-05,"I read that post from that dude that posted the DD about AMC about to hit bankrupcy with the upcoming Public Offering of 200M shares, but I don't buy it. Theatres won't be dead. Even through this COVID pandemic literally, people are still going to catch their favorite flicks - the problem is, all the good flicks have been postponed to maximize the box-office mayhem potential for post-covid, which God knows when.

AMC is a titular chain in its' respective sector, comparable to the likes of Walmart / Powerball / US Foods / American Airlines / Apple - and the list goes on, you get the point. Obviously not hand-in-hand and certainly not at similar scales (just look at the stock values lul), but assuming theatres will simply die, or that they are operating at a loss so they will run out of cash soon and close down... I personally don't buy it. Whether it's in the form of some dumb market syndrome right now, or FOMO, or government bailout, or early vaccine hype, the chain will eventually crawl back, but more importantly, survive. The worst of COVID has already passed for most retailers, though the market is extremely bullish and due a major correction in the next ~6 months (could be as soon as 3 weeks from now with TSLA -&gt; SPY triggering some ripple, idk), what hasn't died as a household name will make out of this just fine. Road to recovery may be long, but it will be there. 

If people are starting to look at cruise stocks already despite all the bad coverage and near-complete shutdowns during COVID, theatres will make it past also.",Inori92,wallstreetbets,9.0

They also pay 1B in rent each year on the remaining property.

I would estimate that 1B in rent gets then 10B in property, so +70% of their property is rental, the rest only the debtors can claim in a bankruptcy.

Good amount of the property probably has a lot of value, I don't see any way for AMC to sneak any of that value out, and I would imagine it's going to take a big hit because the building is themselves will probably be razed instead of converted into anything.

Also their filling documents said any bankruptcy filing will probably result in the total loss for investors, which is typical.

Basically, they know this move fucks the investors, but they decided this is a last stitch effort to save any value for investors.

And I really am rooting for AMC to survive all of this. I think they're an amazing company and my family has spent probably a thousand person hours at the theater there. They're easily could be a bailout or vaccines could come quickly, this could give them three or four hundred million which might stave off bankruptcy for three months.

It‚Äôs the same shit with airlines. Don‚Äôt give them billions for being over-leveraged and not appropriately managing their finances.

I want GME to survive and give ALL of us numerous tendies and memorabilia deals. That said, I ALSO want AMC to not shit the bed and get some life support until they can course correct or get bought out. We can make it happen :)
