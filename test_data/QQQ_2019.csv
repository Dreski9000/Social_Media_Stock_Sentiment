3 reasons not to buy sqqq calls

1. Liquidity - it’s much harder to buy and get rid of them

2. Bid/ask spread - because of #1 and low volume typically there are much larger bid ask spreads which end up meaning you get a worse price

3. Price increments - the price increments are only on dollars which means there is literally a 5% difference in strike price. For qqq there are sub percentage point differences between the strikes 

1 reason to buy sqqq calls: they require less capital

Overall my advise is this: if you want to be short nasdaq, buy sqqq shares or qqq puts.  Sqqq shares don’t have Time decay and 3x leveraging which makes them useful. ",orchid_breeder,wallstreetbets,20.0

I can tell you that I’m actually thinking of long term gains and this year and the next is going to perfect for scooping cheap shares of companies like SQ, AAPL, NVDA, WMT, AMZN, MSFT, GOOG.

There’s a point at QQQ current price and current date/time, and there’s another point that is your specific breakeven price and the expiration date. Now imagine a straight line connecting these two points. 

If the price of QQQ moved exactly along this line until expiration, the value of your call would theoretically stay the exact same the entire time until expiration. If QQQ’s price goes below that line, your call will lose value, even if QQQ still goes up.

2,2019-01-11,"Market has been rising at a slower rate throughout the week. Liquidity slowing down. We’ve had many green days in a row, but nothing major to push us past the big resistance points. The lack of liquidity and the constant testing and rejection of 260 leads me to believe we are potentially headed for a bigger rejection. Same with QQQ vs 161. If futures open red and stay red into Monday, I think we see he beginning of a pull back down. If SPY had broken 260, I would’ve been bullish into Monday. AAPL and AMZN looked weak today. If they stay weak and open in a dump, they can pull down the rest of the market down. Of corse, if Citi releases a killer ER before open, we may get the juice needed to break through 260. 

I think the weekend/market is full of uncertainty so I’d rather hold puts than calls. If we start bullish and break through 260, I’d cut my losses and jump into calls. With all the uncertainty, the only position I’d feel comfortable holding over the weekend was puts. ",Marshy92,wallstreetbets,2.0

These 2 are already beaten down but have plenty of room to move lower.  On a different note.

[MSFT:](https://i.imgur.com/aFxBOcp.png) This chart's like a TA wet dream. Broke out of the rising wedge and sold off to support, bounced back up to backtest the trend line today and failed. Expecting a move back down to test 101.50 and eventually 97.50 or lower. 

[GOOGL:](https://i.imgur.com/uOU2zNy.png) Pretty close to a bearish engulfing candle and closed below the 200 MA. Support in the 1106 range, look to short if it drops below. 

[AMZN:](https://i.imgur.com/CdiNHae.png) Looks extremely bearish. Bearish engulfing candle as well as a close below the uptrend line. Expecting a lot more selling tomorrow and see what it does with 1600 support. 

[And a recap of QQQ:](https://i.imgur.com/iOYUaGj.png) Daily chart isn't very telling, but today we actually saw some selling with volume (though volume was really anemic between lunch and the last minute before close, very weird). Opened near the 200 MA, got rejected hard and dropped to 170ish and bounced hard but made 3 lower highs.

0,2019-02-12,"It's just a different style of trading (premarket news volume scalping shares vs intraday options).  

\-options aren't open pre or post market (exception on spy, qqq only open 15 min afterwards) so it's limited.

\-some trade premarket because they can't during market hours (i.e. they can't trade if they work during the day).

\-commissions on options generally higher for higher # contracts (unless you're at tasty) than block of shares (tasty only advantage).  

\-Tons of huge money do ridiculous blocks of shares on various instruments like SPY/QQQ (1-10+ million dollar trades) all day long looking for tenths of a percent repeatedly.  SPY isn't taking 5% in a minute without a major event (sudden world war 3 breaking out) or a crazy flash crash.

 u/Nicodemus985 is doing very short term premarket news/momentum plays.  Could EA tank 6% in a minute premarket after being up 5% on good news?  Sure, but it's unlikely and that what he's betting on.  The real question is how much is truly at risk here, what's the max pain for this trade in reality?  Probably not that much on a big cap stock like EA on such big premarket positive news volume.  EA isn't tanking a huge amount in a minute unless the FDA releases a statement that Apex Legends causes cancer or that the they are restating financial documents for the last 20 years.  Probably a couple percent max loss here on the premarket shares IMO in this scenario and OP has his hand on the trigger mouse the entire time or has stops.

5,2019-02-12,"I love the FB and SQQQ charts, I am confident enough with those to make moves with. With NVDA and QQQ the charts haven't touched the neckline, which I believe another commenter points out. But, FB and SQQQ could very easily be an indicator for what's to come. I think directly playing FB is a safe play, but a more risky and potentially more rewarding move would be a general play on QQQ. 

I especially think these charts are pretty applicable is due to momentum shift. MACD is about to crossover, likely this week, and the big quarterly earnings end this week, so I think that we are more likely to see these patterns play out because both technical and fundamentals are turning bearish.

2,2019-03-03,"I share this view. People are so quick to cheer the Fed backing down off of hiking interest rates that they never stopped to consider why they are doing that. It's unlikely the economy will descend into a recession, but it's most certainly decelerating from the breakneck growth of the last few years. And with many, many stocks at their ATH, the market doesn't seem to be pricing this fact in. No matter if the Fed pauses rate hikes or not, an economic deceleration must by definition lead to a contraction of earnings multiples.



Also, I would hazard a guess that the GDP numbers for Q1 are going to be much worse than a lot of people are pricing in right now. Many companies were frantically front-loading factory orders into Q4 of last year as well as January and February of this year in anticipation for Trump's tariff hike.



This is the reason why a lot of data shows inventory buildups (not only in the U.S, but worldwide). This burst of economic activity barely kept China Manufacturing PMI afloat this week, but my guess is that for Q1 of this year there will be a sudden drop in manufacturing data and economic activity because a lot of this year's goods have already been made and shipped.

11,2019-03-08,"Sure, here are two recent examples, I'm rounding numbers to make it easier to type. I own 200 shares of SPY. 

Covered calls --- Last week I sold 1 SPY call at a $280 strike for $3 dollars (per share), which means that if SPY goes above $283  I stop making money on 100 of my shares, but if it does not go above $280 I get to keep $300, 281 I keep $200, etc. My break even is SPY at $283. Today, because SPY went down I was able to buy back my call for $100, so I made $200. I lost money on my stock, but the money I made from selling the call helped hedge my losses.  I generally sell covered calls under three conditions: I am already up money on the stock, the stock is near it's highs, and the premium from selling the call is worth capping my upside. 

Selling puts to lower cost basis -- this tends to work best with stocks that are getting beat up, because you get a lot more money from the options... in December when the market could not find a bottom at a certain point I said I want to get in, but I want to get paid for taking the risk.  I sold a put in QQQ at 150 strike for $5.00, I think QQQ was at 155.  If QQQ went below 150 I would then essentially own the stock and would also keep the $500 for selling the option, essentially meaning I bought the stock for $145. If QQQ never went to 150 I would still keep my $500 , which is what ended up happening. But I would have  been perfectly happy either  way, in fact I would have preferred it to go to $145 and then go up after I owned it...

1,2019-03-09,"So I ran over the [Dark Pool buying](https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix?) + [Smart Money Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_money_index) thing I posted [about earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ayv9hm/weekend_discussion_thread_march_810_2019/ei3jky9/). Here's an update with Friday's information. 

My process is this: I look over the list Squeeze Metrics puts out for subscribers that lists unusual dark pool buying or selling activity. If I see a name pop up a couple of times, I cross reference it with the Smart Money Index to see if the broader market confirms. 

I also sometimes check out particular names I'm interested in that don't necessarily pop up on that ""unusual acitvity"" list. SAP was one such catch. Next time I'm going to try and keep my personal/subjective picks on a separate list. 

**Lots of Dark Pool Buying + SMI trending or reversing upwards:**

1. ABB 
2. AMZN
3. BCS
4. C
5. **DWDP** (was on my previous list)
6. IVZ
7. JNUG
8. **MO** (was on my previous list)
8. MOMO (earnings this week)
9. NEM
10. **SAP** (was on my previous list)
10. SOGO
11. SRPT
12. WFC
13. **XOM** (was on my previous list)

Changes from previous list:

- Dark pool buying volume or proportion of buying for FOXA, ITUB, LLY, NKTR, NTNX, ORCL, and TSM dropped off considerably Friday. 

- RIO had an increase in dark pool selling Friday, but Thursday was also its ex-dividend date, so that may have played a role. 

**Lots of Dark Pool Selling + SMI trending or reversing downwards:**

1. BGS
2. DFEN
3. DUST
4. INGN
5. PRS
6. PRA

Notes on this list:

- CQQQ and KWEB have appeared on the ""unusual selling"" list but SMI isn't showing a confirmation. Similarly, INDL (the 3x leveraged India Bull ETF), EWW (Mexico ETF) have all had unusual selling this week, and YINN (3x China bull ETF) and EEM (Emerging Markets ETF) popped up yesterday but again the SMI isn't clear.  

- TSLA likewise has seen heavy dark pool selling these past few days but isn't being confirmed by the SMI. It's notable that before Musk's big announcement about the cheaper model 3, they were however doing lots of buying.

- IAU (gold ETF) has been on the unusual selling list a lot, but SMI isn't confirming and it seems odd that there'd be buying of gold miners and selling of miner bear ETFs at the same time. 

**Broad Sector/Index Notes:**

1. SPY: Increased dark pool buying each of the last three days
2. QQQ: Increased

Other notes:

- Last week/early this week saw lots of selling of small caps and biotech. Friday though saw heavy buying of TNA, the 3x small cap bull etf. IWM and XBI also seem to be trending upwards in regards to proportion (but not aggregate volume) of buying:selling.

- Thursday saw lots of buying in FB and selling of SQQQ. Friday reversed that, with FB seeing lots of dark pool selling and QQQ and TQQQ getting sold.

That means it will probably head down there again. Or atleast till you get out. I would either buy put speads on UVXY/VXXB and VIX tomorrow morning to try to capture any more down movement and start playing off of your shares now.

For example, start selling put spreads 1-2 strikes up on Vix or VXXB or UVXY.  

You can hold those shares but you need to do something so they don't just decay daily until we have the pop you are looking for.

My trade, by the way was from $27.10 to $33.50,  But get this, It actually went up to $37 and I was very upset that I sold out at $33.50.

So know this, if you hold those shares,  you need to do things to make sure you are making money every day while holding them.

SO, perhaps buy SPY or DIA calls at 930am tomorrow morning etc..

You need to make sure you offset the losses of that while holding it.

&amp;#x200B;

AMZN is big dick option trading. But I follow SQ daily. Did you make money today?  


What's helped me is sticking to day trading, or EOD buying if I think there is a good chance for a gap. EX SQ trading down, and diverging from buying pressure in QQQ, I might look into calls (like yesterday) .  Also, when I'm in a follow 5-min price action of the underlying like a hawk, stick to hard mental stop losses.  Don't be afraid to take a loss, delta is at least on your side, so a gap against you won't hurt as much as a gap in your favor will help.  


If I see a good profit, I take it, and don't 'HOPE' for more unless there is hard evidence it will keep pumping, like if the whole market is surging.  Even still I'm watching 5-min candles for an exit or a top.  I cashed out 40% today and 25% yesterday from a call and a put, respectively, when I could have held for 100%+ in both cases.  But I'm happy and would do the same again because I stick to my style. 

&amp;#x200B;

Profit is profit, it is our job to take money away from the market, no matter how big or small.  All that matters is we hit sell and actually realize the gain before it vanishes into a loss and then expires to zero.

10,2019-04-11,"I've said many times, Only buy options that are $0.10 or less and only 1 day expiration, so You would buy options today at 330pm  that expire tomorrow on QQQ/SPY etc..

Make sure they are $0.10 or less per option.

If you want you can even buy vertical call spreads and make them extremely cheap.

The idea is to close them in the morning tomorrow if we have a gap up or hold all through tomorrow and see if the market gets pumped near end of day tomorrow.

You would only be spending $200-600 every week doing this.  And at some point one will hit and you can make $2000-8000 if you hit that pump that always happens when we drop a little on the Nasdaq/Dow/S&amp;P.",legiondoom,wallstreetbets,10.0

Im scared of shorting because of the possible unlimited losses. I need to learn about shorting since I have a long short portfolio (with options only). I also have a stock portfolio with only one stock in it for now: Disney lol. 

Yeah absolutely. I do agree that buying leaps on fully priced stocks such as TTWO is not a great idea especially with a weird market like the one we’ve had since February of last year. But it dipped quite a lot and rsi was very low so I felt like it was a good entry point. I also have a smaller portfolio. I am up quite a lot since then but I admit its risky. If it goes back to $140 I will sell and buy the stock. If it crashes im ok and will probably average down and roll over. I think im getting pretty good with risk management. I had a rough time last year so I learned my lesson.

Just do it with 1 single option in the beginning. You then don't have to worry about losing anything that will even scratch your portfolio. 

Then buy 1 put and watch what it does etc..


Then later you would sell 1 put spread.. and then sell 1 call spread.. 

thus your intro to selling options..


Point is, learn and see how they screw you yourself with 1 single option.. just buy 1 options for 1-2 weeks or 1 month if it's cheap enough.

Only buy 1 and study it. 

Watch the times of the market.. you'll notice something from 930am-1055am..

1145am, 1245, 115pm,215pm,315pm,330pm..

2,2019-06-01,"Buying $SPY or $QQQ and selling covered calls two or three strikes out of the money is a boring but logical solution for you.

You can, as many others have said, look for stocks with higher implied volatility to increase the yield. Think of companies like $BYND or $TSLA. Just note that the higher IV does mean that your long shares could get fucked eventually. However, the option premiums are basically free money as long as the price doesn't go tits up.

Another alternative, which deviates from covered calls but is essentially the same thing, is to sell cash-secured puts. Use the cash in the account as collateral and sell out of the money puts on stocks you wouldn't mind owning, $SPY, $QQQ, $TSLA. If the stocks go up, you keep your full premium without actually owning any shares. If the stocks drop you are assigned shares and can then sell covered calls against them so you kind of get to play both sides. This is my primary tendie-generating strategy. You're not going to buy a yacht doing this but if you are consistent you will eventually outpace a lot of the folks here.",Networking4Eyes,wallstreetbets,2.0

4,2019-06-11,"Usually its the prices of the underlaying are adjusted so that the moves are the same for the price of the options.  For example right now:

TQQQ = 58.44

QQQ = 183.40  or 3 x 61.133 which is very close to 58.44

So given that QQQ is ≈ 3x TQQ in absolute value, then the delta and gama of the TQQQ and QQQ options being almost the same per point (they usually are) then the price of the options relative to the actual NASDAQ change very similarly to one another.  Think of it this way: options are derivatives just like TQQQ is a derivative of the NASDAQ.  TQQQ is a derivative of the NASDAQ designed to try and give 3x of the underlying.  The options on TQQQ are derivatives that have been priced to give roughly 1/3x of the underlying (at least 1/3x of the underlying relative to options on QQQ that is).  So options on TQQQ are like options on 1/3x (3x (NASDAQ) ) = options on 1x NASDAQ only with much worse liquidity.  Obviously not perfectly so as 61.133 ≠ 58.44 nor are the deltas and gamas perfectly priced to be 3x or 1/3x between QQQ and TQQQ but they are close enough that it is a reasonable aproximation and also makes it easier to understand why options on TQQQ v.s.

Facts:

1. Nov 2007 - Mar 2009: QLD dropped from $15.01 to $2.57, losing 83% of its value. If you‘d bought near the top and BTFD as much as possible.. this would’ve been a real shifty 1.5 years for you. Arguably your returns would still be better than 99% of the helmet wearers here but still

2. QLD would not cross $15 again till Aug 2012, roughly five years from the top in 2007. If you held for 5 years, you would’ve broke even

As of Friday’s close at $100.38, if you bought at $15 initially, your return as of today is 568%. If you had bought it at $2.57, your return would be 3805%

Say a -83% starts tomorrow, for the next 1.5 years (similar to 11/2007 - 03/2009) - QLD will be $17.06 at the end of this bear market",4dr14n,wallstreetbets,0.0

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry, I had to, this is WSB!

&amp;#x200B;

In all seriousness, I understand the question. 

&amp;#x200B;

A different fact you might ask next given your first question, and other than what's been provided that might be helpful:

&amp;#x200B;

\- When you buy a put or a call, that sucker will lose money until the second it expires, even if it's moved in your favor. Think of an option as a brand new Ferrari that will be either 'damaged' or completely totaled in X (insert # days to expiration) days, guaranteed.

&amp;#x200B;

\- When you buy a put or a call, you can do 1 of a few things. Let's say you buy a Call on $QQQ on a Monday, expiring the Friday 4 days in the future for our example.

1. Sell at any time during market hours, for hopefully a profit, and hopefully on the same day you bought it. Overnight options is for insane people, except I've had my best trade ever on an overnight $AAPL Call, of course.
2. Hold it overnight. Again, this is for crazy people. I do not know how anyone who wants to win consistently has the stomach to do this. You guys are all insane.
3. Roll it. You can essentially sell your call and buy one for that expires another time further in the future at the same time. Someone who does that can explain more - I don't do it, I understand the concept but I am in and out of trades within the same day, so I never would need to roll.
4. Hold it until expiration. I would say, don't do this, also, if you're doing this, you're in 1 of a few situations:
   1. You've got a solid winner, and you want to buy the stock. If you hold an ITM option at expiration, your broker will exercise it for you - you'll own those shares (100 x number of option contracts x price of stock). Now, I'm guessing that most brokers alert users who don't have the proper funds to exercise an option so they can sell it, and I'm also guessing that if you can't afford the shares, the brokerage will likely sell the option on your behalf - never happened to me - anyone? What happens here?
   2. You can't / couldn't sell the option. Crazy shit went down and you couldn't sell the option. This is probably because shit went tits up and it's no longer liquid, so no one is buying your garbage, worthless option with 3,4 days to go! When this happens, nothing you can do, really. Just keep an order on and hope someone takes the bid.
   3. It's definitely expiring worthless. Here, you've either just fucked up and decided your stop loss to be at -99.99%, or you ran your bid down on your garbage trade so low that Friday sucks the last 2 cents off the price.",WhipTheLion,wallstreetbets,0.0

A few important lessons from this: Individual stocks have way more potential than major indexes, by a mile. My picks outperformed whatever play you could make on SPY/QQQ by a good factor. Even if you don't like/agree with my picks, I encourage y'all to pick 2 or 3 stocks you know well and play on those. Consider fundamentals, study them charts.

**Predictions made yesterday for today's trading day:**

**BULLISH:**

* Very bullish on Lyft. Beauty of a day for the stock, at  **+$2.04** **(3.41%)** I was bagholding and printed some solid tendies but chickened out and exited early.
* Bullish on ZS ( **+$0.52** **(0.62%)** ), OKTA ( **+$3.82** **(2.94%)**), TEAM ( **+$2.67** **(1.94%))**, Z (**+$1.33** **(2.72%)**)
* Also bullish on ROKU  **+$0.12** **(0.12%)** , Apple  **+$1.25** **(0.62%)** and LK (-$0.17 (-1.89%) )
* CRWD  **+$1.54** **(2.30%)** 

**BEARISH:**

Very bearish on Humana. Today **-$4.01** **(-1.52%)**

* Bearish on NFLX **+$3.77** **(1.00%)** and LULU.  **-$0.75** **(-0.40%)**
* TSLA (daily results don't matter. You can't be bullish here!)  **-$0.28** **(-0.12%)**

There are a handful of trades in my system, so tomorrow, I'll post an update stating whether there was a trade or not.

Here's a hint. I sent this message to one of my new buddies from here to try to help them discover the system.

**NOTES**:

Get a chart - put only these things on it, because you don't need anything else, in fact, you only need the first thing on the list if you can do basic math, but all of this makes it easier.

* QQQ bar chart, 13 minute time frame.
* Volume
* Price change (if your chart doesn't have this, you can code one) \[essentially, I have a section on my chart that just is red/green bars that just tell me the price move - every bar I move should tell me how much up or down the stock went)

Take some time, hit me up with thoughts. My guess is you'll work your way to the pattern.

You'll find a way:

* Study the month of JANUARY 2019.
* There is a pattern that happens 4 times in January, and it's so simple that it's literally right in front of you.
* All trades are long
* the loser gets stopped out with the .35 'big move' method pretty soon after entering
* These 4 trades, at 95% of $5k start, goes from $5k to around $23k.
* moves: \~80%, \~150%, \~28%, \~-16%
* do not over complicate it. think as simply as you can.",WhipTheLion,wallstreetbets,21.0

I check my Robinhood account to make sure the Librul media didn't cause another flash crash and wipe out my QQQ faggy D's before expiration yesterday.  I smirk to myself as I see a solid 5% profit on that gamble.  Man, I'm a fuckin' stock god.  It's going to be a great morning.

0.55/0.58 at the moment. If you're down 35% ish, you paid about 0.84 for them, or about $10.5k.

11 delta and you think you're gonna have a 2-5 bagger from a couple red days? You'd be lucky to break even. No way it's going to be worth $1.68-4.20.

10,2019-08-11,Been telling everyone to buy QQQ puts for a week! Good luck!,goingontwelvethirty,wallstreetbets,10.0
11,2019-08-11,"QQQ looks fairly weak to me. Relative strength has been making lower highs compared to higher highs in price. RSI was higher on the push up in April before the dip in May and made a lower high on its last visit to ATH. MacD flipped on the weekly. Closed below the 50sma on the daily. Daily and weekly candles are both hanging man candles. 

I feel like the market will test the 200 day at 175ish before end of month and then September will break up or down depending on what kind of news we get on trade, interests rates and the overall economy.  There is nothing good that can come out from now until then that matters enough to move the market, super strong economic data will lead to the belief the fed won’t cut, and an emergency rate cut before September might tell us we are headed for some nasty times. Unless China does some funky shit and we respond by cutting rates, but that won’t be net positive for the market. So I’m expecting only bad news on trade until September and the Economic numbers pretty much flat. Trump won’t do a trade deal or pump good news on one before the fed cuts again(which he wants) and that’s taking a generous assumption that the Chinese even give a shit about making a deal.

I’m holding 125 QQQ puts for 8/23 $175. Sure it’s down 35% but I was green on Friday and with this volatility all I need is a solid two days of red and it’s a 2-5 bagger. I also subscribe to the notion that we’ll be at 150 again in December but don’t have any positions open on that yet, but it’s pretty much based on the Belief that rate cuts won’t do dick and China won’t make a deal. The relationship will only get worse causing more tensions around the globe, not to mention the Iranians, North Koreans, Hong Kong, or brexit and the rest of crumbling Europe.

12,2019-08-11,"WSB is not the place to ask about hedging a portfolio...

How you hedge depends on the size of your portfolio, and how much you want to hedge (do you want to hedge 10%, 30%, 50% of downside, etc?). Why do you want to hedge? If you're not going to sell these positions for several years, a paper loss in value shouldn't dramatically affect you.


You could hedge by buying QQQ/SPY puts that are longer dated, but you're going to be paying a high premium for this protection. You could also short sell a micro Nasdaq or S&amp;P future - but you would only do this if your portfolio is over $15,000 in value otherwise you would be way over hedging. You could calculate an exact hedge ratio, and sell the number of contracts needed to achieve that, without paying for extrinsic premium (and experiencing theta decay)

If you're long shares of SPY and hedge out by shorting QQQ you're betting against yourself. A hedge will reduce variance, but at the cost of profit. If you buy puts as insurance for your long term equity position you are implying the market will go down. If you are betting the market will behave a certain way and do not adjust your long term equity position, that is just bad position management.

Buy ATM intradays 4-5 weeks out on SPY or QQQ and try to catch 10-20% gains more often than losing 10-20%.

As for other plays, we k kw the market is going up and volatility will now continue its push down back to $12 or under.

  


So selling put spreads on any movement down on SPY or QQQ is the trade for next week.

I am not finding arbitrage, and I'm not smarter than everyone, however I know that my chances gambling with selling put spreads are higher than everyone else since most stocks either trade sideways, stay in a range or simply go up after drops and selloffs..

  


We know that apple is coming put with news this week.. so therefore selling put spreads after any dip is going to work.

  


And yes I let all my put sorewds that I sell expire worthless and I dont even buy them back to close.. just let them all expire worthless.

  


The repair strategy is just to sell call spreads on top if it goes under my strike..

  


But I also try not to sell strikes that should be major problems..

  


Take QQQ for example, I'll look to sell $187 or lower strike put spreads expiring this Friday..

Let’s say i buy 50 shares of QQQ. I then sell a call credit spread OTM. 

Next, I put in a contingent buy order for ~1$ below strike price. If this executes, I sell the bought call portion of my spread, assuming it is worth more than paid. 

Thus turning the spread into a covered call position. If I get assigned, I keep the premium from the spread plus the value of the call and the price appreciation from the stock. 

If it stays OTM then I resell the spread. What risk am I missing here? Other than the stock tanking. 

Margin req stays low as we only need it for the spread and if we sell weeklies then the interest would be minimal compared to premiums.

4,2019-10-03,"&gt; I’d be making profit on any level &gt;280 correct

Well I assume you mean ""&lt;280"" as ""&gt;280"" means ""greater than 280""

Sort of, but it is a little more complex then that as options have both intrinsic value (the value that they are worth if exercised to get their underlying) and extrinsic value (time dependent value attached to the option beyond what the underlying is worth that decays over time).  When you buy leap puts with like a two year expiry they tend to have a lot of extrinsic value which will slowly decay over time (though they won't decay all that fast until you get within a few months of expiry, hence why you should buy them so far out on something that is hard to time, to minimize this loss in value over time).  Puts bought OTM also have an implied volatility (IV) attached to their extrinsic value – its the part of the premium that the market makers are charging in proportion to what they believe the % move risk is for putting the given option into the money (and thus them on the hook for paying out).

Together this means if you buy an ATM or OTM leap put with a strike of 280 then you might not profit when it hits 280 if it takes a long time to get there and volatility is down when it does get there relative to when you bought them.  You should definately be getting close to profit, but the timing will matter – if you buy the 280p 2year leaps today and they are ITM by tomorrow then yes you will be profiting, but if they only wander ITM say like a month before expiry they will have lost so much extrinsic value that you may need the index to get down to 260 or 250 before the puts are profitable.

""Well how can I tell?""

You will have to play around with an options calculator [like this one](www.optionsprofitcalculator.com) here to get a sense of what is reasonable/profitable ect...

Just as a peak I put in a 280 SPY put with a year and a fourth time expiry (Jan 2022), contracts cost about $2860 each and [this is the output table of the options value relative to dates and price of the underlying](http://opcalc.com/1eS)  to give you a sense of the time decay v.s. profit/loss.

You can reduce the effects of the time decay by turning it into a put-spread, [like say this](http://opcalc.com/1eV), where you have bought a 280 put and wrote and sold 200 put.

I think rate cuts are much less likely and would be the cold water on any immediate market move up. Fed is quite divided on any more rate cuts this year and Powell himself is fairly hawkish, so I just don't think it's in the cards unless we do really see shit hit the fan.

If you want real TA the general thought is that today's runup fills up to the weekly downward trendline, without sufficiently breaking the pattern so a bearish outlook should be maintained and Monday has a higher chance than not of showing a pullback or flat trading. 

It is not to say that up up up is not possible. Especially if you believe in conspiracy theory/PPT, as we closed at 188.81 at the close on Monday prior to the shitshow and somehow ended 188.81 today at QQQ right on the button, which is suspicious given the strange price action nearing close yesterday. So while the technicals would suggest we're still in the midst of a pullback, there are sufficient catalysts that can prop the market back up and if we moon we would without question see 300 again at the SPY, though its upper range is probably capped at not too much higher than that.",knotswag,wallstreetbets,2.0

6,2019-10-08,"Thanks for adding that info, but it still lacks detail.  It says they invested in EM and commodities, but not how much.  I am not saying the fund was definitely NOT more risky than the S&amp;P 500.  I am saying we don't have enough information to say one way or the other.

If they have a net 65% equity exposure and net 10% in EME, is that really riskier than the S&amp;P?  It depends on what the rest of the allocation looks like.  

Like, if I held a portfolio today whose equity exposure was exclusive EEM (emerging market equity), QQQ, IJR (US small caps), and IBB (biotech) - would you say my portfolio is riskier than the SPY?

What if it was only 50% equity and the other 50% was split with TLT (long maturity Treasuries) and IEF (intermediate Treasuries)?  Trailing 10 year beta to the S&amp;P is .40 and standard deviation is 7 vs 13 for the index.

Granted, it also had a much lower trailing return than the S&amp;P 500 but that's because the past 10 years is like a mirror to the trailing 10 years of 1996 - 2006 (the commodity supercycle and EME outperformance).

13,2019-10-08,"Let’s rewind to end of April. Everyone was bulled up and expecting a huge deal. Then Mango Tweeted out of the blue that talks weren’t going anywhere and we were moving ahead with big tariffs. Everyone got caught offsides and then lost vast sums of money chasing every positive trade rumeor until things bottomed and came back again on positive Fed news.

Now, Fed is still amazingly scared of tanking the markets which is extremely bullish but you have an entire market that seemingly expects no deal anymore because of a couple of Bloomberg headlines. This seems like the polar opposite of the end of April. Reading through Twitter half of America is comprised of social workers that dedicated their lives to wiping out oppression in Asia. The outrage towards China and capitulation on the hopes of a trade deal have reached a bottom IMO and the time is now to get aggressively long the trade sensitive names. I’m talking the semis, the casinos, all that shit.

Take a step back and think- do you REALLY believe Mango actually cares about the steel worker or farmer, let alone Hong Kong citizens’ civil rights 😂? Does he have a long history of voicing those opinions? Or does he have a history of self service and backstabbing to get ahead?

Dude is using this trade stuff to goose the markets. He does not want markets to sell off and as we move closer to the election and the threat of impeachment he needs a win. I think something happens this week- if not a deal some delay or reduction of tariffs for a while in an exchange for some more soybean purchases.

4,2019-10-12,"I’m reading lots of people on Twitter who are pointing out that this trade deal is nothing and think they’re real clever for spotting the end of session sell off and I think they are about to get a real good cucking. Of course the deal is nothing. It was always going to be nothing because China was never going to agree to stop the forced tech transfer and American companies are going to keep making shit there because they have no choice. No they aren’t going to move to Vietnam or Taiwan or whatever place the experts who have never worked for these companies continue to speculate about. All one needs to do is watch how Apple does whatever China tells them to. They aren’t going anywhere. Anyway I’m getting off topic.

Here’s why the phase one bullshit deal is very bullish for equities. Imagine that the trade crap never started. That we had exactly the same relationship we had with the Chinese before Trump was elected. All things being equal- the fed, ultra low interest rates- stock multiples and sentiment would be higher. But they aren’t because of all the uncertainty surrounding trade. There was a persistent possibility that things could deteriorate and Apple and micron and all the casino companies with massive China exposure would take a massive earnings hit for the foreseeable future. In the worst case scenario it could really cause economic problems. But that wasn’t a likely outcome so equities were highly volatile but with a floor from the low rates and a ceiling with the trade uncertainty.

Now that the relationship has thawed it doesn’t matter that there isn’t an actual deal with significant outcomes. People looking for a deal that itself would be good for the economy are completely missing the point. It is now much less likely that things will deteriorate much from here. With such low interest rates and a dovish fed that is now expanding its balance sheet multiples should go higher. All the market was looking for was some assurance that things will stabilize and not get worse. The market confirmed this yesterday with a massive upward movement when it became clear some kind of truce was imminent. And FWIW I’m putting my money where my mouth is. I’m now basically 100% invested with a significant percentage of my trading account split between Micron and QQQ call options, and TLT put options, all already up but I think they have lots of room to run as all the permabears and skeptics start to get the joke over the next 3-6 months.",dkrich,wallstreetbets,4.0

3,2019-11-05,"It really depends on the type of investing you want to engage in and the goals you are seeking to achieve. 

If you're looking for comfortable, passive and relatively risk free investments to appreciate over time then you should read about [treasury securities](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/073113/introduction-treasury-securities.asp) and [government bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/government-bond.asp).

If you're looking for comfortable, passive investments with some level of risk, ETFs are kind of the hot rage. Read about these [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp). You are essentially buying a portion of someone elses' portfolio. You yourself probably can't afford 1 of every stock in the Dow Jones, it would cost you almost $27,500. But someone else can spend millions buying the Dow Jones index and sell you a portion of their accumulated portfolio. $SPY, $DJIA, $QQQ, $NERD, $YOLO are all examples of ETFs. 

If you want to try your luck at speculative trading, focus on individual stocks. Try to pick the ones who you have reason to believe will out perform the overall market. At the end of the day, you want to create what's called [alpha](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alpha.asp), this is your overall return relative to the general market's return, weighted for risk. The higher the alpha, the better the investor. 

If you're looking for high risk, high reward, high octane, ""I might lose my whole portfolio tomorrow"" investment strategies, consider [speculative derivatives](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/12/derivative.asp) trading. (I really don't recommend this, that's how you end up on the front page of this sub with some loss porn). These derivatives have what's called time decay - since they expire at a certain date and can expire worthless, the ""time decay"", called [theta](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/theta.asp) slowly but surely decay the value of the derivatives until they hit 0. This is what leads people to lose ridiculous sums of money in a week like u/memecapital.",BugsSuck,wallstreetbets,3.0

I’m in deep remission right now. On REMICADE and weed.. I get flares every so often but I’m pretty much ok. Stress is obviously the number one issue with this disease... stress even a little bit and shit starts to spiral out of control.

The thing is.. I really really really enjoy trading. It’s fun as hell to me.. even though ive lost a lot of money. The thing is, I’ve always told myself, just keep learning .. learn from the mistakes... follow my rules... and always get better. I’ve been trading for a year now and have made lots of errors but have written all of them down.. my take:

1) don’t FOMO
2) don’t play earnings, ever
3) play either VERY strong stocks (AAPL, etc), or just the index ETFS (QQQ SPY IWM etc)

More recently, it was rejected again last week at 1825 and currently weekly candle looks like ass. Cyber Monday + Black Friday hype probably helped push it up last week but it again failed to break out.

Plus it gets shit on every time someone in congress mutters something about breaking up or regulating big tech

Also high RSI and near MACD crossover on the weekly candles. Weekly and daily momentum has fallen off a cliff. I bought a few QQQ puts today for 1/24. Guidance is terrible for most sectors, earnings need to significantly beat and guide for any gains, so many earnings calls are beating and ending in drops.

2. Just historically, [escalations have always occurred during market tops](https://i1.wp.com/heisenbergreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/MarketPeaksVsTradeDeescalationDB.png?w=615&amp;ssl=1)
3. Market has been def buying into ""good"" news, but ignoring the ""fake"" news. I think this is largely due to the systematic inflow from algos/MMs given that gamma vs spot is net positive (if we drop lower, MMs well flip to net short and start selling, but above this point they will keep buying in- ES spot currently at 3080) BUT there is 0% reason to believe that the good news is more reliable than bad. So this market is def not pricing in a escalation on 15th. 
4. Last time there was a delay in tarrifs, it was Dec 1 in 2018- well in advance of the planned tariff escalation to be done at the end of the year (by jan 1 2019)
5. [Kudlow coming in again](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/kudlow-says-china-tariffs-still-on-table-for-dec-15-2019-12-10) to remind that ""dec 15 tariff' still on the table
6. Trump is known to be engineering the fed to lower rates via trade war escalations, which has resulted in net equity boost. It is very well known that he perfectly understands that descalation of the trade war will lead to a more hawkish fed which he does not want-  if he deescalates, [he losses leverage with the fed.](https://heisenbergreport.com/2019/10/25/will-trump-give-up-his-leverage-over-jerome-powell-to-secure-a-deal-with-xi/)

If I believe company A is going to outpace company B and I’m trying to grow my account, then I should not invest in company B. I should put as much money as possible in company A. 

Now this isn’t to say to invest in only 1 company forever. But you should try to just pick a few companies to follow who you truly think are bette than their peers. 

Otherwise OPs 10k portfolio won’t go down really if one of the companies crash, but it sure as hell isn’t gonna grow unless multiple of them go up.
