1,2019-01-02,"You gotta feeeeel the market, man.

But yeah, this isn't a short term thing imo, so Feb earnings is probably a fine point in time to dump. My hypothesis is that if/when things slow down, the very first place businesses are going to cut their advertising dollars is going to be on ""high funnel""/""lower intent traffic"" (eg, FB.) 

Who the fuck goes on FB when they want to buy something? You go to Google/Amazon, search ""huge black dildo"" and then click an ad or an organic link. It's push vs pull marketing. Facebook ad revenue is huge because business is great and they can afford to spend on an otherwise less engaged audience.

If you know anyone who works in a B2C marketing department, ask them how well their FB spend performs. It's a pretty shit ROI compared to other advertising mediums.",Imjalepenobusiness,wallstreetbets,1.0

My best (but probably wrong) guess is that they are a way of transferring large cash positions between institutional players (probably banks).

9,2019-01-10,I'm just in digital advertising so I'm coming from that POV and buyers are very trendy. They need to show clients new things to make the clients feel like they are getting a service that they can't simply do themselves. Because Snap is never in the endemic budget and more in the experimental budget I've seen those budget so to other stuff lately like video ads on AVOD platforms. They're not new anymore but they also aren't strong enough‚Äîin the buys minds‚Äîto put them on every plan. SMBs aren't into it because of the lack of targeting and again it's not as ease as FB so if they're not getting money from clients like huge movie studios as much that could become a problem long term.

13,2019-01-10,The counterpoint would be that they don't offer the targeting and ease of use that Facebook/IG offers. Media buyers go for the easy stuff because the margins in media buying are no longer there so they don't have the skill or time. No one will buy Snap ads without buying FB/IG first and I think that's a problem or concern. They're not endemic on media plans‚Äîmore of a side piece still.

FB gets bad social media coverage, but the bottom line will only be hit when (1) people actually stop using it or (2) congress passes anti-data collection laws.

12,2019-02-02,"While i appreciate posts with a thought and some work behind them i really do think that this comment is a gross misstatement of the market.

The comparison between Ebay and Amazon is probably the only one with some substance. But while comparing Ebay to Amazon one has to keep their different positions in mind. Amazon was and is doing all the right things and that is priced into their stock. Every little misstep or hickup will be disappointing from a shareholder point of view. Ebay on the other hand ist a troubled company with a track record of mismanagement [that even lead to activist investors getting involved.] (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-22/elliott-says-urgent-changes-needed-at-ebay-in-letter-to-board) 

So Ebay has a lot of upside in its management while Amazon has all of its upside in further market expansions but also some downside potential due to mismanagement that currently is not priced in.

You say that FB rose because of top and bottom line beats. That is only one part of the story though. The other, more important part, is that investors were expecting a lot of hurt to FB financials due to more scrutiny from regulators aswell as groing concerns from a part of its userbase. So the bigger factor in FB stock jump was its ability to weather the storm and continue being a hugely profitable company amidts those concerns.

Similar things apply to Starbucks. While many companies took hits from a slowing growth in China, Starbucks posted a huge surge in new stores in China. Eventhough the number of stores do not necesserily lead to a profit growth, investors interpreted this move as a sign of strength and as a possibilty of growth and market diversification.

To sum it up: Amazon has its own strengths and weaknesses. That said comparing it with the past performance of different stocks while misinterpreting the cause of their performance is foolish. The same goes for Amazon itself. While Amazon Prime is one of the customer facing divisions it also is Amazon loss leader and thus (currently) only a small part of Amazons enormous valuation. Thus a ""MLB deal"" or ""superbowl commercials"" may be intelligent longterm decisions they will have little to no impact on the near term stock price.",LTC_Bengelz,wallstreetbets,12.0

Amazon has 2 super bowl commercials this weekend and is rumored to be buying the MLB and Yankees for streaming. Nobody held for the top and bottom line beat with this in mind.

Also GS, FB, Nike, Starbucks all went up 10%, 14%, 7% and 4% on top and bottom line beats and held overnight.

FB and SNAP will be competing for the same content, but FB can out bid SNAP rather easily.  With the integration of WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram, FB is trying to make a SNAP hyper clone.

1,2019-02-10,"Berkshire Hathaway will soon see a massive loss in its Q4 earning as its AAPL holding alone lost at least $20 billions.

For companies holding large amount of equity securities, earning volatility can get extreme under the new tax law.

Apart from banks, I would value most companies based on:

- Price/Operating Cash Flow
- Price/Free Cash Flow
- Enterprise Value/Operating Cash Flow 
- Enterprise Value/Free Cash Flow

Using the above metrics, BTI no longer appears that cheap, especially considering its trailing P/E ratio was artificially depressed by some one time gains:

- P/OCF = 8.2
- EV/OCF = 18.67

Now compare these numbers to FB:

- P/OCF = 16.70
- EV/OCF = 14.57

BTI‚Äôs EV is high because of its substantial debt load. Its core business is declining and its revenue is sustained by price increases. Now the US government might ban one of its key products that contributes up to 25% of its earning. 

Facebook does have its problems too, but its most recent earning shows its core business to be fully intact. Its revenue still grows at an impressive 20+% YoY, although its margin contracts due to heavy spending.

With NVDA and QQQ the charts haven't touched the neckline, which I believe another commenter points out. But, FB and SQQQ could very easily be an indicator for what's to come. I think directly playing FB is a safe play, but a more risky and potentially more rewarding move would be a general play on QQQ. 

I especially think these charts are pretty applicable is due to momentum shift. MACD is about to crossover, likely this week, and the big quarterly earnings end this week, so I think that we are more likely to see these patterns play out because both technical and fundamentals are turning bearish.

AMZN fell some before bouncing strongly and ending up. FB fell some, but bounced and closed high. AMZN and FB did not go green to red like SPY and they did not close red for the day.

3,2019-03-09,"So I ran over the [Dark Pool buying](https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix?) + [Smart Money Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_money_index) thing I posted [about earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ayv9hm/weekend_discussion_thread_march_810_2019/ei3jky9/). Here's an update with Friday's information. 

My process is this: I look over the list Squeeze Metrics puts out for subscribers that lists unusual dark pool buying or selling activity. If I see a name pop up a couple of times, I cross reference it with the Smart Money Index to see if the broader market confirms. 

I also sometimes check out particular names I'm interested in that don't necessarily pop up on that ""unusual acitvity"" list. SAP was one such catch. Next time I'm going to try and keep my personal/subjective picks on a separate list. 

**Lots of Dark Pool Buying + SMI trending or reversing upwards:**

1. ABB 
2. AMZN
3. BCS
4. C
5. **DWDP** (was on my previous list)
6. IVZ
7. JNUG
8. **MO** (was on my previous list)
8. MOMO (earnings this week)
9. NEM
10. **SAP** (was on my previous list)
10. SOGO
11. SRPT
12. WFC
13. **XOM** (was on my previous list)

Changes from previous list:

- Dark pool buying volume or proportion of buying for FOXA, ITUB, LLY, NKTR, NTNX, ORCL, and TSM dropped off considerably Friday. 

- RIO had an increase in dark pool selling Friday, but Thursday was also its ex-dividend date, so that may have played a role. 

**Lots of Dark Pool Selling + SMI trending or reversing downwards:**

1. BGS
2. DFEN
3. DUST
4. INGN
5. PRS
6. PRA

Notes on this list:

- CQQQ and KWEB have appeared on the ""unusual selling"" list but SMI isn't showing a confirmation. Similarly, INDL (the 3x leveraged India Bull ETF), EWW (Mexico ETF) have all had unusual selling this week, and YINN (3x China bull ETF) and EEM (Emerging Markets ETF) popped up yesterday but again the SMI isn't clear.  

- TSLA likewise has seen heavy dark pool selling these past few days but isn't being confirmed by the SMI. It's notable that before Musk's big announcement about the cheaper model 3, they were however doing lots of buying.

- IAU (gold ETF) has been on the unusual selling list a lot, but SMI isn't confirming and it seems odd that there'd be buying of gold miners and selling of miner bear ETFs at the same time. 

**Broad Sector/Index Notes:**

1. SPY: Increased dark pool buying each of the last three days
2. QQQ: Increased

Other notes:

- Last week/early this week saw lots of selling of small caps and biotech. Friday though saw heavy buying of TNA, the 3x small cap bull etf. IWM and XBI also seem to be trending upwards in regards to proportion (but not aggregate volume) of buying:selling.

- Thursday saw lots of buying in FB and selling of SQQQ. Friday reversed that, with FB seeing lots of dark pool selling and QQQ and TQQQ getting sold. 

- FANG names are mixed. AMZN, BABA, NFLX seem strong. BIDU, FB, NVDA, TSLA, and TWTR seem weak. AAPL and GOOG flat/holding steady. ",FireSail,wallstreetbets,3.0

and second: [On May 16, 2017, Bloomberg announced that a former Snap employee, Anthony Pompliano, had filed a lawsuit against Snap, ""claim[ing] he was fired after three weeks on the job for raising questions about allegedly false growth metrics [and] seeking whistleblower protection against retaliation by [the] company.""](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/shareholder-alert-bronstein-gewirtz-grossman-llc-reminds-investors-of-class-action-against-snap-inc-snap-and-lead-plaintiff-deadline-january-31-2019-2019-01-18)

It's just weird how much Spiegel sells. FB by contrast, went public 5/18/2012. Zuckerberg sold shortly after that date on 05/22/2018 at a price of $37.58. His next sale didn't come until 08/17/2016 when FB was at $123.71

[Here's where I found that](http://openinsider.com/screener?s=FB&amp;o=&amp;pl=&amp;ph=&amp;ll=&amp;lh=&amp;fd=0&amp;fdr=&amp;td=0&amp;tdr=&amp;fdlyl=&amp;fdlyh=&amp;daysago=&amp;xp=1&amp;xs=1&amp;vl=&amp;vh=&amp;ocl=&amp;och=&amp;sic1=-1&amp;sicl=100&amp;sich=9999&amp;isceo=1&amp;grp=0&amp;nfl=&amp;nfh=&amp;nil=&amp;nih=&amp;nol=&amp;noh=&amp;v2l=&amp;v2h=&amp;oc2l=&amp;oc2h=&amp;sortcol=0&amp;cnt=1000&amp;page=1)

There was a sale made on 12/26/2013 by Zuckerberg but that website's key says it was for taxes.

Spiegel? He sold twice in 2017 not counting the after IPO sale. He sold FIVE times in 2018, the year Snap posted a ($3,445,066) net loss. He sold Snap at a price as low as $6.43 and 1,495,200 shares at that price.

My point here is this: while besides selling a portion after the IPO, other CEOs of media companies weren't selling until their company's stock price got to around an all time high, trying to maximize their value of the stock they own.

It seems Spiegel is just trying to get what he can as his company goes into the shitter. He's fake, deceptive, and only out for personal gain. Listen to his earnings call's closely. He sounds like he has no fucking idea what he's doing as CEO. 

As Quavo said on his newest album: ""Where am I at? Where I go? **How did I get here?""** -- That is Evan Spiegel as CEO of Snap, Inc.

15,2019-04-01,"Correct - all the scandals etc. are a concern but the fact is Facebook hasn‚Äôt dropped at all. It‚Äôs at rock bottom. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a buy.

More importantly, FB (all products) still made 20 billion dollars in 2018 - despite scandals. Daily Active Usage (DAU) went up 10% - despite scandals. Advertisers also doubled their price per ad - despite scandals. This is a classic example of people saying one thing (‚ÄúI hate Facebook‚Äù ‚ÄúFacebook sucks‚Äù), but doing another. 

In addition, Instagram partnered with PayPal to offer a one click buy feature. When it‚Äôs rolled out you will be able to click on influencers / businesses tags and instantly buy whatever they‚Äôre showing. This is a brilliant idea to improve impulse buys. Think about all the college girls with daddy‚Äôs credit card. Currently purchases make up $284 million of FB‚Äôs revenue; a very small amount. This will change.

And those drops would have had to either happen fast or if he bought the puts at a low strike before the big drop and then FB fell into it.

Like if he bought $180 puts when FB was at $200 and then it dropped fast down to $178 etc..



Now, if he ""SOLD"" the puts, he would have had to have sold puts when Facebook was LOW ($131) and then went High. ($173)

15,2019-04-09,"&gt;The highest amount of transactions for a stock was 10 over 3 months here, if I'm reading this chart right. 

It's definitely not an HFT system, but you can't look at transactions in one ticker and consider that indicative of all the transactions from the entire system. The target holding period looks like \~4 days. Assuming you have multiple signals each day, you're not limited to one ticker over three months. Assuming you always at least have one position open, max loss of -2.5% over 252 trading days with 4 day holding period is \~80% of your portfolio.

&gt;Regardless, it seems like you're agreeing that a stop loss should at least be based on some measure of the asset's distribution of returns (sortino is definitely better, but I wasn't going to go that far)

Not really. It depends on how you view risk. If you're only using the distribution of returns as your basis for risk-adjusted inference, then sure, use some sort of VaR, CVaR, CTE, or whatever tail risk measure tickles your fancy. But I'm assuming that if you're running 10M+ dimensions in an inference model, you're probably getting enough of an information coefficient to disregard historical distributions as representative.

&gt;True, that wasn't a good blanket statement, but what black swan events have occurred with rising liquidity?

Depends on what you consider a black swan. When FB tanked 20% last year, there was plenty of liquidity, people just didn't want the stock anymore. It's all relative.

&gt;Wouldn't your position sizes need to be fixed for that to be the case? It's hard for me to imagine a fixed system of exiting being more effective than one based on the portfolio's historical/expected future returns or geometric mean of your max draw down.

If your signal treats every ticker homogeneously, then using heterogeneous stop losses makes very little sense. Limiting your losses as a function of your capital instead of a function of the stock price keeps risk fixed in your positions.

Ironically, using probability-based risk measures based on max loss distributions is exactly what caused so many people to get caught with their pants down in 2008. What they thought was a 6+ deviation event turned out to be a \~2 deviation event. So you're suggesting a way to unknowingly expose yourself to the same risk you're trying to prevent.",notextremelyhelpful,wallstreetbets,15.0

12,2019-04-11,"Sure thing!

My main earnings strategy is to sell far out of the money puts the day before the earnings release. The expiry I pick is the closest one to the day after earnings which will have the highest implied volatility. Implied volatility (IV) is very high right before an earnings release because the non-inside traders don't know if the stock will go up or down. It's a gamble. Some stocks are more volatile than others. Companies like $AMD or $TSLA are going to move huge while other companies like $JPM (tomorrow morning) may not move so much. The higher the IV the more money there is to be made. 

&amp;#x200B;

After the earnings release the IV drops an outstanding amount because everyone knows what has happened. This is what is referred to as ""IV crush"". For example, $BBBY had an IV of 129% before close 4/10/19 and dropped to \~50-70% on open today. You will recall from your Black-Scholes options mathematics that Vega is the relation of an options contract price to IV. Price goes up, IV goes up, price goes down, IV goes down. Basically, you can guarantee that every earnings release on every company will experience enormous IV crush. If you buy the calls or puts you're screwed by this no matter what direction you pick. If you sell a call or put you can capitalize on this IV crush by selling the contact when the premium is grossly inflated and buying it back cheap after the crush.

&amp;#x200B;

So why ""far OTM strikes""? This strategy is not foolproof. If you sell an ATM put and the stock shits (like $BBBY did today) the change in Delta (the relation of the underlying to the options contract price \[e.g. stock goes down, call price goes down, put price goes up; stock goes up, call price goes up, put price goes down\]) may cause you to lose money if the change in Delta is larger than the decrease in Vega. Remember that when you sell a put the worst case scenario is that your contact expires in the money and you are assigned and will own 100 shares per option contact on whatever stock you picked at the strike price you picked (although the stock price may drop much lower than whatever strike price you picked so you will own shares that are worth much less). If your contact expires out of the money you get to keep the premium you collected in full. The name of the game is to pick a strike that will not expire in the money. So look at how the stock moves during past earnings. $BBBY moves like 15-20%, so you need to pick a strike that can tolerate that movement and not be in the money. $LULU moves like 20% on earnings. If your strike is low enough you don't need to be too worried if the stock shits the bed 20%. 

&amp;#x200B;

When you sell puts the profit is capped so this is not yacht-making money. The return for the lower profits though is a higher probability of success which if you execute this strategy over and over again you will start to accumulate some nice wins and you can start to laugh at the people who buy calls and puts the day before earnings and lose their ass on the I V  C R U S H and that they picked the wrong direction. 

&amp;#x200B;

Below are some real trades I have made illustrating what I have described:

&amp;#x200B;

3/20/19: $MU sold to open 22 MAR 40p at 1.35 at 109% IV.

3/21/19: $MU bought to close 22 MAR 40p at 0.29 at 60% IV (1.06 profit). 

3/27/19: $LULU sold to open 29 MAR 130p at 1.62 at 135 IV.

3/28/19: $LULU bought to close 29 MAR 130p at 0.02 at 80% IV (1.60 profit).

4/2/19: $GME sold to open 12 APR 8.5p at 0.16 at 113% IV.

4/3/19: $GME bought to close 12 APR 8.5p at 0.13 at 65% IV. ($GME shit the bed. This one came close to not being profitable but it worked out for a tiny 0.03 profit).

4/10/19: $BBBY sold to open 18 APR 15p at 0.14 at 129% IV.

4/11/19: $BBBY bought to close 18 APR 15p at 0.04 at 70% IV. ($BBBY shit the bed too but the IV crush was massive too. Doesn't matter, 0.10 profit).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm all cash at the moment (aside from a small position in $REML) in preparation for $NFLX earnings on Tuesday. The 18 APR contacts are already around 69% IV and they usually trade around 35% (forecasting a 34% I V  C R U S H already!). You could sell the 18 APR 312.5p at 1.00 and tolerate a 15% drop in the stock after earnings. Not a bad buffer. After that we have $TWTR, $FB, $TSLA, $AMD, and $AAPL.

&amp;#x200B;

Learn your Greeks, research the company, read the previous year 10k, read the news about the company, see through fidelity some reports or what analysts think, don‚Äôt go too far out of the money on calls bc their cheap, don‚Äôt use emotions ever..use that strategy you went in with, watch out for super volatile stocks (Tesla), sell some contracts as the weeks get closer to not lose your entire portfolio over an earnings bet, take a break from gambling for a little bit (I‚Äôm addicted, I still do it daily and keep losing honestly), and day trade if you have to meaning you got a nice profit and it‚Äôs gonna tank..get out of it who cares. 

Best of luck hombre and don‚Äôt blow $ bc one day we will need it..I got a flat tire and need my wisdom teeth removed lmaooo so you never know!",akhtarst,wallstreetbets,2.0

4,2019-05-03,"Oh hey dude it's you!  Didn't look at the name until now.

The reason is because I don't really need the collateral, it hasn't constrained me vs any trade I've wanted to make at all.  This is my active account, which is linked to my passive account, and that account is much bigger and provides a lot of margin.  I (up until Wednesday) was using considerable margin shorting volatility (250% short maintainance requirement), and now I'm using that margin writing naked puts on high-IV stocks.  I was always doing that, but I'm doing it more now.  I think for me, right now, considering the use of cash going long and paying interest, I would rather be short puts, collecting cash, having theta on my side, and having directionally bullish trades... that *seems to be* the best use of margin to me right now.

The AMZN spreads are big - I have 4 bull spreads at 1700/1740 (was a little early on that one) and 2 at 1600/1640.  So 16K maintenance + 8K.  Credits collected there were bigger than FB, total $13K.

AAPL I have some nice ones, 25 160/165, 10 180/185, and 10 195/200 for June 2019 I'm glad I didn't panic close.

NFLX it's the same shit, they're all pretty big trades (for me).

Uh, I'm not sure what you are suggesting? 1) who has that kind of cash sitting around or has the capital leverage to fund it with debt and also 2) wants to own a gaming company? AAPL? GOOGL? FB? DIS? Just seems like a weird pivot for any of them, they have their own core competencies and I would be very bearish on the merger because it would be a huge lack of synergy with high likelihood of introducing incompetence in the form of mismanagement.

  
Not to mention I've already stated I think $EA is overvalued as of today, so if AAPL bought them I would say AAPL got a bad deal even using a hostile takeover method (about $7bil too much) and if they priced in a 10-20% premium ($100-$110/sh) as is standard when trying to aggressively negotiate a good deal, I'd say they overpaid by up to $11.5bil.

So now I'm holding FB right now so I wouldn't have enough to sell a good amount of contracts, which I want to be able to scale out of the position which I like being able to do.

So on DIS let's say you write $135 you can walk away with about 2% in returns as long as DIS doesn't crash ($260 with $13500 in capital).

12,2019-05-08,"I can't tell you specifically what to do, but I can tell you this.  Buy something, like fb calls, dated jun 14 or so.  Try to buy at a decent price, and if the stock goes down more, buy more to average in.  So if you have 10K to spend, put 5K in your first purchase, then if it goes down, put in another 2.5K, then if it goes down more, wait for a larger percentage move, then buy your last 2.5K.  Wait until fb moves up a few bucks (which I think it will by Friday afternoon) and then sell calls at a good strike for a premium that makes sense.  i.e. if your strike is 5 bucks up and you can get 50% of your call premiums that you paid, then take it.  You risk losing max 50%.  However, you probably stand to gain a decent amount (probably around 100% of what you put in because of theta) if the trade deal news on Friday is good.

0,2019-06-07,"Actually it is a lot more complex than just the futures. These big fund managers use future contracts as a ""hedge"" for the most part but the futures can also indicate general market sentiment before cash open. 

They buy or sell indexes like XLF(financials), SMH(Semiconductors), XLT(Technology) which are the three key indexes that directly affect price of SPY. Then they can also buy sell one of the monster constituents of SPY individually to affect SPY price. SPY has 500 stocks, but it is not equal weighted. BA, AMZN, AAPL, FB, MSFT, GOOGL are one of the biggest constituents by market cap. If someone wants to tank SPY, selling one or two of these stocks so they are down a lot for one day will directly affect SPY and prevent it from rallying, even causing it to go red. Same applies for financials XLF. In order for a perfect SPY rally to happen, financials techs and semis should all run. Then there is the whole bond market, example ETF would be TLT. If those rally, financials tank and thus SPY tanks. 

Market makers always hedge and have neutral positions so they make money on either case. Correct, options pricing does not fluctuate based on how many options contract are bought. Options pricing depends on the usual underlying stock's implied move (IV), stock price and expiry.

Ok kids. gather around papa! Time to preach

FOMC is next week. The market is trying to price in a rate cut as we speak based on the choppy action you have seen in the past 2 days.

It would be advisable to stop taking risks on mega caps, large caps and the index options as we navigate these choppy waters. Search for niche companies which do not follow the trend of the index. That might be BYND, TSLA, TLRY etc etc.. So you get the message, ya meme stocks basically. 

This FOMC is going to be a huge huge catalyst event. How to play it Papa???? Well Papa Ashes is going to have a \~40$ strangle FDS on AMZN before FOMC. 

1. Rate cut: Market will instantly spike up. Have a day trade available but do not hastily close the losing position. Let the market digest the news. Once direction is clear those amzns fds will be worth 5-10x their original price and you will recover cost of your strangle too.
2. Rate steady and they say we will think next fomc: Market will crash like nothing else and we likely will see 272-275 before we ever see 294 on SPY. Again AMZN fds will be 5-10x if not more if you hold them from Wednesday-Friday or even Thursday mid day.

&amp;#x200B;

Bonus freebie from Papa because WSB LOVES TA so much. 

The stock that I am most interested in aside from AMZN as a play beyond FOMC is Facebook (FB)

/u/yolosense : There is cup and handle formation on the weekly for FB.

[Facebook Weekly Chart with C&amp;H](https://imgur.com/rYQhocH)

Again how to play this, if rates are cut, there is huge huge upside to FB because of economic events + C&amp;H formation. Calls on this once event is completed. Massive upside with ATH target.

If rates are not cut, this formation will obviously break and the handle will be an avalanche fall back to base of the cup of even further. So puts on this.

Yes there might privacy issues and red taping for FB in the future, but as option traders our job is to get in and get out within 2-3days and this works best. Advice is to preserve capital till FOMC.

* GOOGL/FB are gatekeepers for all news sources across internet. they are taking away ad rev from publishers
* there is no regulation, be it government or judiciary, to control disinformation spread
* GOOGL/FB have bought up all competition GOOGL (applied semantics, doubleclick, and admob) and FB (instagram, whatsapp)

You make some valid points. My guess is we will have moments in the coming years where we both feel right and vindicated.

9,2019-06-12,Why would you bet against fb,beegreen,wallstreetbets,9.0
10,2019-06-12,"I base my short term investments and option plays on fake news. I've found that the most reliable. Latest example: antitrust case on FB, GOOG, AMZN. That day everything dropped. So it was obviously a fake drop to companies not associated with the cases, so buy companies that have nothing to do with the news. I chose cloud companies. They all recovered to near all time highs. Another one was TWLO making more shares available. It was 750m worth. Nothing in grand scheme. Drop was fake. I don't blindly buy on news like this. I look at charts and if it dropped substantially below its trading range over the last month or so, it's a good bet it'll recover. My most recent one (the one I'm in now) is CRMs drop from 167 to currently 151. It's from the acquisition of a company that'll make it a lot better. In this case a drop is warranted due to earnings changes and some share dillution. With that said, it hasn't been in 140s forever so unlikely any way but up. Its normal trading range during bad news month in may was 155.

Anyway, to me news and events are best way to get safe bets on stocks. TA works, but I'm not entirely sure there's any basis for it to work. I think the only reason it might work is because it's a self fulfilling prophecy. It's like if TA shows a breakout point is 103.5, then the stock goes higher than 103.5 and it shoots up to 120 in 10minutes. Why do you think that happened? Probably because all the algos and all the TA analysts, and all the news articles written for dumb people said that if price goes above 103.5 then it's a buypoint. So what does everyone do? They buy. So this stuff only works because everyone believes it works. Just my opinion.

As for indicators I use. Mostly volume. Some 50d and 200d moving averages. And I know they say past performance is not indicator of previous performance, but I don't buy that. I look at the last 1-3 months to see how it's been trading, and as long as no different company specific news comes out and earnings aren't soon then it's likely going to trade in a range so I buy low end of range. I almost never buy a stock that hasn't been above my buy price on multiple occasions recently.",Zer033x,wallstreetbets,10.0
11,2019-06-12,"very educated DD. I'm breaking it down into 4 main points:

1. digital ad platforms evolve and fb will fall with the rest (mags, radio, tv, etc)
2. crack down on privavcy
3. decaying business model
4. slowing the pipeline of data- apple actively working on this
5. shit leadership

&amp;#x200B;

First off, I'd argue Google is king in advertisement platform, but FB is a little more dubious so draws more attention.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Hindsight is 20/20 on this but theres no way digital ad platforms are going anywhere anytime soon
2. Privacy- IMO, EU has successfully established this attack on privacy as an income source to supplement the total lack of any innovation and squeeze US tech company profits. Having said that, if you ever listen in to any of the hearings on privacy, it is blatantly clear that majority of politicians have a gap of understanding/lack of any knowledge into how facebook collects/uses data (watch zuccs hearing for a good laugh at how stupid politicians are). Tech can consistently stay a step ahead of privacy policies to the point where they will be unaffected. I also dont understand why ppl are getting in a huff about social media privacy when companies like target literally leak your credit card and are still thriving.
3. decaying business model- ad revenue growing, significantly outpacing any legal action/privacy fines
4. Apple's blocking of data across apps- not really versed in this. I'm assuming this is like you can use your facebook login to go buy something on etsy and facebook will have user activity on external sites? A lot of platforms are doing R&amp;D in privacy, but seeing it come to fruition, especially if it is going to affect monetization of your customers, is a different thing entirely. I'd bet we dont see this come to light anytime soon. But i understand this is speculation and doesnt mean much.
5. Not really sure what this one is. Zucc is a shark, sheryl is one of the most influencial women in the us. If i wanted to run a successful company, I'd have them at the head in a heart beat.

&amp;#x200B;

Bonus short opportunity- By the way, ppl think F20 is only going to be about Xi and Trumpy, but global digital taxation is high on the agenda there. this would allow any country facebook sucks data from users in to take a chunk out of fb revenue.",HowToBeAwkward_,wallstreetbets,11.0
12,2019-06-12,"seperate boards would be created (admittedly zucc would prob be on both), but data/resourcing/finance/integrations would legally have to be broken up. These factors are the things that give whatsapp a competitive advantage and enables Facebook (entity) to corner the social media market. Without them, multiple players would be able to compete on level playing field and (the argument from anti trust regulators is...) would lead to innovation through competition.  

FB would not give up its ambition to own the digital messenger/text market, so would probably try to build its own whatsapp or promote messenger as a direct competitor to whatsapp. Too much data (read $$$) on the line to rely on a dependent partnership even if zuccy is on both boards.",HowToBeAwkward_,wallstreetbets,12.0

Luckily the last few days have been stellar for profits - I hope you've found the advice from the last few posts useful. Recommended options so far have been on point!

Again, plenty of opportunities to make $$$$$ on both sides. Bulls and bears can easily win in this market. Just a matter of timing your entries/exits right, picking some good stocks and being patient. Here are the stocks I'll be watching closely. Apologies if it's a bit rushed - I've got some deadlines to meet asap and the time dwindles.

**Stocks for the BULLISH crowd:**

* PYPL is a bullish power play rn. So is CRWD (can moon any second!)
* APPL and FB ain't looking too shabby if you're feeling bullish and want to play a FAANG. Keep an eye on TWTR, LK and XLNX as well
* SQ and ROKU should keep climbing up. Monster potential for SQ til the end of the week.
* If you want a longer dated call, ZEN and TWLO, and NYT won't let you down

**Stocks to play if you're feeling BEARISH:**

* COST, WMT, CMG, LYFT (Lyft puts only for a day or two... It should pick back up after)
* Bear power play: SFIX, NFLX
* TSLA. Very few reasons to be bullish, plenty to be bearish. If trading TSLA is your thing make sure you think twice before getting calls. Flip a coin 3 times, see if it lands on its side.

STAY AWAY FROM BA/CRM/BABA/SHOP (if you want your trades to be better than pure gambling). These are treacherous stocks atm.

2. Do more research into public cloud space. You'll find AMZN is overpriced and getting picked apart by competitors.

3. Is this point in regard to having a cheaper ecommerce web/app presence? It really doesnt take much money to spin up an online shop, but name brand and shipping logistics network would be AMZNs real advantage here.

4 and 5. Anti-trust cases are focusing more on GOOGL and FB more than AMZN for a split up.

42,2019-07-10,"&gt;They don't have legal liability. 

You are an ignorant shit that doesn't understand how the fucking law works. 

Whether someone has legal liability or not comes down to a judge. That is almost certainly 50+, cannot touch type or google things.

&gt;It is pretty common knowledge that if you are running windows XP in your environment today, you are teetering on some shit.

It is absolutely NOT common knowledge.

Most Americans don't realize that their credit card and SSNs are essentially public knowledge to either FB/Google/Russia/China. Judges are either elected or appointed politically, and ""IT qualifications"" aren't high on anyone's list these days. People don't realize that Russia and China can and *do* read people's email because their passwords are easily guessed.

The extent of the hacks aren't common knowledge. Ask the electrical grid operators that got their shit hacked by the Russians and the FBI had to tell them.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-15/russian-hackers-attacking-u-s-power-grid-aviation-fbi-warns

https://www.ecmag.com/section/systems/dhs-and-fbi-say-russia-hacked-us-electric-grid

Or the North Carolina ballot operators that got hacked by the Russians.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/01/us/politics/russia-election-hacking.html

Hell, nobody's denied that China has been spying on potentially trillions of packets of unencrypted data. Every month or so there's a story on Slashdot about some random researcher finding some credit card credentials on an unsecured, non password protected Amazon instance simply by brute forcing URLs. The Chinese and the Russians have that shit down to a science.

&gt; End of life is very common in all types of enterprise software, 

Doesn't mean that it's legal or that a judge won't drop a liability bomb on them. Look at California's grid operator when they were held liable for the wildfires.

&gt; The legal argument really doesnt make sense to me.

Color me surprised. I'm ripping your head off because you don't know shit about liability and how it actually goes down in court.",tempaccount920123,wallstreetbets,42.0

FB Cup and Handle Formation update July 12th: [https://imgur.com/STfVamD](https://imgur.com/STfVamD)

The depth of the cup was around 40-50 points. In my opinion we are just getting started with FB's push. Last earnings they completely crushed!

Measured Price Prediction: $250 EOY

**APPLE:**

[AAPL Cup and Handle Ready to go!](https://imgur.com/bAvXGxP)

IMHO, AAPL is ready to leg up back to ATH and beyond. Macroeconomic conditions might produce a 50-50 earnings, but AAPL's move to services is very smart.

Measured Price Prediction:  $235 EOY. The cup depth is actually 70 points, so from pure TA perspective $270, but it seems very very unrealistic.

1,2019-09-01,"The biggest problem with the ""break up tech companies crowd"" is that they don't understand that the internet (and smartphone) has created a situation where national market share easily flows towards a single ""national monopoly"" in tech markets.

Most of these companies (especially Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft) are horizontally structured.  Amazon is instructive: Amazon has market dominance in both cloud (AWS) and e-commerce ([Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com)).  Okay so you separate AWS from [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) into two separate companies.  What have you achieved?  Nothing because they each still have leading market share in their separate silos.

Google is the same: Separate Youtube, Google Search, Waymo, and Android into 4 separate companies...; okay you still have 4 market leading companies.  At most you've restricted Youtube and Google Search dominance of ad markets by separating them.

As far at $MTCH is concerned, I *do* believe it'll drop prices initially because FB is more realistic competitor than some weird 3rd party startup dating simulator, so obviously the variance will probably be a ~5-10% or somewhere between the lines, simply because FB Dating will be ""new"" and everybody flocks to the latest and greatest, even if only temporary. 

Honesty speaking, the only people I see dropping Tinder Premium are the broke people who couldn't afford it in the first place, so while I forsee a future with $MTCH having a slight decline in subs, I see it as no difference in their total variance of subbing/cancellations of subs.

At the bottom line, it honesty depends on what FB dating will offer in terms of functions that will ultimately make or break Tinder Premium.

I think I read that this dating app was tested on smaller places outside the US. Don't quote me on it.

Also Facebook has more data stored on a person's activity than any dating site. Could lead to more ""organic"" matches that's not just based on attractiveness ELO score.

However, there are people like me who likes to keep their dating and social life separate (I don't want my mom to know I'm gay trader), so that's also a thing to consider. After all, Facebook fucking sucks with privacy.",AbrocadoPie,wallstreetbets,16.0

In an ideal world, fb funnels all x-billion users to yelp and that number doesnt change. Suddenly yelps revenue skyrockets. Obviously that wont happen.

As a side business, it could make counters for bouncers that are IOT devices that would ""pump"" that business in the search results however it would ensure a very more accurate count of the male-to-female ratio.

0,2019-10-09,"&gt;I doubt the body count for the drone strikes is over 1,000.

Oh man, you should do some research.  

&gt;Forty-five former **US military personnel, including a retired army colonel,** have issued a joint appeal to the pilots of aerial drones operating in Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria and elsewhere, calling on them to refuse to carry out the deadly missions.  
&gt;  
&gt;In a joint letter, the retired and former military members call on air force pilots based at Creech air force base in Nevada and Beale air force base in California to refuse to carry out their duties. They say the missions, which have become an increasingly dominant feature of US military strategy in recent years, ‚Äúprofoundly violate domestic and international laws‚Äù.  
&gt;  
&gt;**‚ÄúAt least 6,000 lives have been unjustly taken by US drone attacks in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, Iraq, the Philippines, Libya and Syria. These attacks are also undermining principles of international law and human rights,‚Äù the authors write.**

At least 6,000 people were killed **""UNJUSTLY""**.  That isn't even counting the ""justified"" ones.

Oh... and this was written in 2015... lol.  The program has only expanded since then.  Keep in mind, when did ISIS finally lose their full control of Mosul?  Yeah, the most populated city in Iraq was under full control of ISIS.  How many drone flights were carried out in the liberation of that city?

Yes. FB admitted themselves that many of the users of their services don't know they're owned by FB. 

Actually, I believe your average person who is just starting with uni is less capable of operating a computer and office than you'd think. Millennials embraced the computer age and learned while the newer generations are taking everything for granted and all apps for their smartphones are dumbed down to the most basic level. They don't know how to properly format a word document or how to do anything in excel. They haven't learned how to properly touch type using 10 fingers. They don't use basic keyboard combinations to speed things up and they certainly wouldn't know how to install an operating system even if their life depended on it. Schools have done a piss poor job at adapting and the self motivation to learn anything isn't their for anyone born 2000 and later because the things they're using for their free time and for social stuff is so user friendly that there's not much to learn.",Cygopat,wallstreetbets,10.0

I actually didn't want anything involved in trade war because I think people are trying too hard to price that in one way or another. I picked SNAP because while some of the other companies I named, Uber, lyft, any canabis company, have already pulled back a great deal from their highs, Snap really hasnt too much. This company has also shown the potential to drop all the way to single digits as recently as Dec last year.

Lastly, only about 35%ish of the shares are institutional ownership. Compared to twitter and FB who are both upwards of 90%. This tells me that many retail investors are in this. When the panic comes to broader market, SNAP will be one of the first to go.

Tesla (as mentioned in this thread) is also a force to be reckoned with. Now, with the subsidies going down for rides and people becoming more frugal (recession talks are already happening within sectors, less hiring being done atm), are people gonna pay a lot of money for an uber when they can take the bus in major metropolitan areas like SF or NY (where majority of uber's revenue comes from)? No. Therefore, in the 2020-2021 timeline, Uber will never be able to make a profit. I anticipate the stock to eventually find support in the 22-25 dollar region once all the people whose lockups have expired will sell the shares that they wanna sell.

Edit: Just incase OP deletes this post I have it save: 

For all you autists out there this is the method for the all new, Robinhood Infinite Money Glitch! What you have to do is find a company that offers high payouts for short term, low risk iron condors. For example you can buy two out of the money calls and two in the money puts and still get offered $30 for every $100 you spend, or an even better amount like I‚Äôve been finding, example $50 for every $100 I spend, (and buy $100 I mean 1 iron condor and for $30 and $50 I mean the min credit you‚Äôd be receiving for buying 1 iron condor) and since these calls and puts are always very far away from the actual stock price you have a very low chance of the iron condor actually failing you if the stock goes up or down.

I‚Äôve been doing this to FB, TTWO, GOOGL, and AMZN. For example this iron condor is on TTWO (take two interactive), for the iron condor, I‚Äôm selling a 130 call, buying a 131 call, selling a 117 put, and buying a 116 put all expiring 12/6, and the price of TTWO is now $121. (LOOK AT THE PICTURES) The limit price for this trade is .03 but with the crazy bid ask spread price that happens after hours, Robinhood will ask you to put in your own limit price of .95 specifically for this trade, you‚Äôll put that in the limit price section, then you will make $95 instead of $3 with an $100 collateral, and once Friday comes along you will have made $195 off of a $100 trade!

(Next few sentences is pretty much what I just said but these sentences go for any stock and not just TTWO) Then what you do is buy however many iron condors of this trade you want. When you accept everything on the order page of the iron condor, it will ask you credit or debit, choose credit, then it will say this iron condor has a special bid ask spread and it will ask you to choose a limit price. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT! Right then and there you have to choose the special bid ask spread in the limit price section. In my example it gave me a .95 limit price giving me $95 for every $100 iron condor. Then you place the order and it will get placed when the market opens (or by the end of the market day).

If the order doesn‚Äôt get placed because the limit price is too high, try lowering it by .10, if you can‚Äôt completely double your money with this iron condor this method will still work as long as you gain 50% of what the colateral cost is, so if you‚Äôre lucky and can find a regular iron condor offering 50% of what the colateral cost is, then you don‚Äôt even have to mess around with the limit price and that will insure the order gets placed! And yes you need someone to actually sell you the iron condor too and that‚Äôs what makes this glitch awesome as it gets filled with this ridiculous limit price.

IF YOU‚ÄôRE CONFUSED LOOK AT THE PICTURES AT THE END OF THIS POST AND THAT WILL HELP EXPLAIN EVERYTHING! Yes this does seem to be a somewhat weird iron condor trade so far but here‚Äôs the thing, you‚Äôre doubling the money your investing using margin so margin will also double the total amount of money it can lend to you, this will lead to unlimited gains/money! Then you keep on doing this method until this glitch gets patched and then we can all buy out google, we‚Äôll all run the board and then we can take out assets and throw one huge damn party!!!!!

See you all on Bloomberg, CNBC, CNN, Market Watch, Buisness Insider and Fox! By the way I can‚Äôt figure out a way to show my margin doubling so the picture is of GUH instead! I love you all wallstreetbets! Promise too bail me out of prison if the SEC finds me! GUH‚Äôs speed to all of you degenerates! PICTURES OF HOW TO DO THIS EXPLOIT PROOF I‚ÄôM GOING ALL IN

Edit 1: and when I say you receive $195 I mean that‚Äôs how much money you‚Äôll get back that margin will double! GUH‚Äôs speed to all of you degenerates!

Edit 2 (3:54PM December 1st 2019): Jartek (creator of WSB) has stickied my post to the top of WSB and proved my credibility that this method does in fact work. I will not post any pictures of the specific past trades I have done even to prove credibility because if I do that I I‚Äôll in fact get caught and probably get in trouble. Though I did send those pictures to Jartek to prove my credibility to him. Also I added paragraphs for you autist degenerates who don‚Äôt know how to read a big chuck of writing.

1,2019-12-05,"Yea, so one of my first times using condors to recover was during high IV environments, when either:

 1. VIX was higher earlier in the year OR 2. During Earnings Season

I would check the implied weekly move of the earnings stock, the average implied move of previous earnings (to see outliers as well), and the calculate the value of the move based on that percentage (so like 4% could be 7$ depending on the stock).

Example: Disney earnings implied move: 5% or 7$, I would sell OTM Condors around a 7-8%  or $10 move with a decent width (distance between short and long leg). They would be weeklies so I could immediately profit off the high IV the next day if the trade goes my way. I have always profited (7/8 this year) off this during earnings season except one time I got greedy with CSCO and moved it a little closer, but outside, the implied move. Managed to not lose a lot on that though. Some earnings stocks to look at: FB, DIS, SNAP (go a little bit extra otm on SNAP), AAPL, AMD

The trick is using stocks that don't have crazy outliers like Amazon could drop or rise $120 off earnings even if the implied move is 70$.",Big_Factz,wallstreetbets,1.0

11,2019-12-04,"I sold one this time last year. Bought it for myself and my wife, and it ended up being a $3k clothing rack. We maybe used it 10 times total because we'd bother rather drink wine and order Uber Eats than work out. 

I can tell you that I put it up for sale on FB marketplace for like $1800? Maybe $2k? I don't know - i just wanted it out of the house because it was stupid and it's easier to go on Keto for 3 months and shed twice the weight than do ""cardio"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, within 10 minutes I had a bidding war going on between 8 people, and some Karen (literally) made me the best offer, and sent her Chad husband out to pick it up in his truck, rolling his eyes the entire time and asking me if it ""turns on"" before handing over a wad of cash - lol. 

&amp;#x200B;

In summary - the general consensus here is right, long this fad shit. Irrational market, etc.

0,2019-12-07,"I was formerly bearish on TWTR but if you think about it FB actually needs to keep TWTR propped up in order to avoid further scrutiny as a social monopoly. So contrarily, FB actually kind of needs TWTR as a foil to its own future success.

TWTR is flat vs one year ago while FB AAPL etc are all up 40-50%+. The recent slump was HUGE and puts it at a major discount relative to these juggernauts which IMO means it is now very undervalued. I am long on FB and I may imminently be long on TWTR. 

I like TWTR's staying power as they have become more of a NETWORK than a social network. I.E., their users are now essentially the pre-digital equivalent of television shows, having the President et al with their own followers. 

Even if they are not growing in userbase I think they will monetize more successfully as the importance of the network to its users (the shows) means it is unlikely to go anywhere anytime soon. Even if it is not growing as fast as FB, if FB and others grow 10-25% in 2020 in terms of stock price, why wouldn't TWTR revive to match their #s if the sudden drop was an event that was severely overblown?",developmentfiend,wallstreetbets,0.0
