0,2018-04-05,"Trade imbalance with a single country doesn't mean anything, depending on circumstance net trade imbalance might not even mean much. Results would be good if things go as Trump plans, except Trump's plans are dogshit, this is about as likely to have the desired effect as his border wall. The reason his plans are dogshit is because he doesn't believe in experts, he believes he's the smartest person alive and that his gut instincts are superior to any advice offered to him.

China's tariffs are strategic, they place tariffs on **all imports** for **specific industries** where there's great potential for developing local industries. They implement protectionist measures for an economy in its infancy, having recovered from decades of foreign invasions and a disastrous communist revolution. This has fostered multiple domestic mega-corporations that have just begun to enter the international market, for example Geely recently acquired Volvo and Wanda Group own a majority share in AMC theatres. Without the protectionist measures, these companies would probably have been crushed in their infancy or be owned by foreign venture capitalists. By protecting these companies in their growth they now have strong domestic brands that can compete in the world market.

By contrast the US is a developed economy, specifically a developed consumerist economy with high expectations for standards of living (mainly measured by amount of consumption). Trump's also pandering to low-skill industries with almost no hope of ever being competitive in the world market, the techniques and technologies of steel workers and coal miners have more or less peaked. The only room for competition is in lower labor costs, which the US cannot realistically achieve. The only way such industries persist in the US is via a similar situation to corn producers, where they essentially make their living off government subsidies.

Then there's the target and language of the Trump tariffs, his language of a trade war doesn't actually sound like the main goal is to strengthen the US economy, but rather to harm China's. Then China can only respond in kind, otherwise they look weak and submissive. The fact that it targets China specifically also means it doesn't really protect domestic businesses, since there are many other Asian countries and Brazil who will provide the same cheap goods and are not targeted by tariffs.

A trade war only hurts both sides involved, it's an economic game of chicken at this point. The difference is that Xi is President for Life and Donny has 30 months tops. As far as the world's concerned, Trump started this trade war (regardless of what people will argue about China's business practice being the cause), Trump's government is also at the risk of losing seats and control if things go south, whereas Xi's party has no such concern. The world's opinion is against Trump and China's not only likely to come up economically on top but also geopolitically.

**TL;DR**: Trump's a fucking moron who is playing economic chicken against the ironclad dictator of the world's most second largest economy. He doesn't know what he's doing and is likely to hurt the economy, his supporters and his own party.",TonySu,wallstreetbets,0.0

“Now, I took the calculator out and I multiplied 2.75 times $12.02 and I got to a number that was considerably larger than $9.95,” Aron said.

3,2018-07-09,"Cable is almost certainly in an adapt or die situation, but think Netflix could be in trouble long term, but it depends almost entirely on their ability to continue producing quality content (not looking promising with House of Cards, Sense8, etc. leaving) and making good deals with content creators who don't want to compete in the streaming space.

Hulu is actually really good, I don't yet prefer it over Netflix, but it has a lot of good content. It's lacking in it's User Interface and Recommendation system, but those aren't hard to fix. You also have to remember with Disney's acquisition of Fox, Netflix is losing a lot and Hulu is likely gaining a lot. I personally switched last year when It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia switched and many will similarly follow content like Marvel and Pixar to Hulu.

Another interesting question is how much with MoviePass/Sinema/AMC A-List affect streaming services? People might view them as complimentary goods, since they both provide entertainment and especially if they perceive diminishing returns on streaming services.

My person thoughts: Netflix is overvalued for the market position it's in, it will be interesting to see how many of these streaming services survive, I think movie subscription services will start to compete in the streaming space, and it will be interesting to see if Disney launches their own streaming service now that they (pending regulatory oversight) own Hulu.

6,2018-11-07,"I intend to hold AMC for a few years and I’m long term bullish. However, they have already published A List numbers a few times and it never did much for the stock price. I think investors are waiting to see how A List plays out in terms of profits/whether it cuts into the bottom line. 

I don’t have real evidence for this but my thesis is that A List will be a net financial positive for AMC. Reasons being:

&gt; People have to go to the movies 3-4 times a month for AMC to lose on subscription revenue alone. Anecdotally, this seems like more visits than most people I know do. 

&gt; In addition, AMC has the advantage over Moviepass that A List only works with their chain.  If I’m a frequent moviegoer, let’s say 5 times a month, I might still go to AMC only three times month and to a different theater twice a month. 

&gt; At least some of the movies people use A List for will be movies they wouldn’t have watched otherwise, namely indies, smaller films and movies that have been out for more than two weeks. AMC has to pay less to the distributors for such tickets compared to recent major blockbusters. 

&gt; Concessions. ",dephira,wallstreetbets,6.0

&amp;#x200B;

My bearish case: how much money does AMC lose because of A-list? If someone used to go 5 times to the movies and now can go those 5 times or even more but for cheaper thanks to A-list, AMC would be losing money.
