0,2019-02-09,Even a retard can slowly diversify out of VOO or VTI into Bonds slowly.  In all seriousness it's bad on taxes and also high expenses. You are better off mimicking it on your own.

0,2019-02-11,Yes but your trend is dumb. You pegged it to 2006 implying that all were equally fairly valued at that time. I'm not saying this is true but if the VTI were undervalued compared to the VPL/VGK in 2006 then this would be expected. If you try this again but start at a bunch of different years you will likely get a different result,ctigers124,wallstreetbets,0.0
