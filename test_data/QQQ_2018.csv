3,2018-01-02,"Shauncore you dont know what you’re talking about.  You are so young clearly, and have never had a conversation with someone during a bad market, let alone managing their money during it.  I gave you a remarkable portfolio pairing and you try to focus on the diversification part of it, it shows how many people are bad at investing and why I blow em away.  You backtest back &amp; forth on your models and you miss the essence behind the performance.  Dotcom crash intro’d qqq w a crash, and its now the pillars of the worlds foundation and that fueled the growth.  Not a magic index that goes up, actual companies behind it.

Berkshire is totally different.  An enterprise closed and small at the top with set protocol designed by the best financial mind who has created arguably the most remarkable corporate culture let alone shareholder culture.  I dont have enough time to go into the nuts and bolts of the true diversification of the portfolio, and it’s something you simply dont get.  Ive seen many people so eager for that cfa coming out stuck as analysts, if the shoe fits.  

You throwing my quote up here like this is lame.  The fact you cant appreciate how harmonious the pairing works shows a lot.  You simply dont get it.  My clients did, and still do I just dont take do it professionally anymore.  As someone just getting into it, you shouldn’t talk shit on a portfolio you would never sniff to come close to.

9,2018-01-01,"Hey, so Im that guy.  For the rich people my ‘backbone’ was that 50/50 pairing then I would invest in stocks that I believe in for various reasons.  I learned by getting burned... is there any other way?  Diversification is a bunch of bullshit.  Amzn has crazy growth in India, why do I need to have an intl growth guy w assets there.  For fixed income apple &amp; brka get better rates than treasury, so I’ll let them handle the fixed income.  I left the business because I hated how my involvement with their accounts cost them money.  Im very anti having financial advisers make more than 25 basis points, the industry disgusted me so I got out and manage my own money.  When I meet people or old clients I advise them for free and have them do their own trades at places like schwab.

If you were one of my clients you wouldnt be pissed because beating the market is the job.  Understanding risk return shows up when you beat the market, dont get it twisted.  Greatest thing about the biz is the numbers are the numbers.  The big firms put together a bunch of bs &amp; terms and its designed to confuse and cost more.  I currently own Tsla, lulu &amp; nvda and am looking to build a career helping the environment while making more funds to invest.  

But for all here, its nearly impossible to beat 50/50 brk.b &amp; qqq.  You just hold it and wait.

1,2018-01-06,"I think it's supposed to be worse because of decay, but weirdly TQQQ is +1000% in the last 5 years, but QQQ is only +140%.  I'd guess that's a result of TQQQ not perfectly tracking 3x QQQ, but I don't know.

Edit: Thinking about this more, it actually makes a lot of sense for the numbers to look like that because the gains in the 3x ETF compound.  E.g. you can recreate similar numbers if the underlying has 10% gains each day for 9 days.  After that, the 3x will have ~1000% gains, while the underlying has ~140%.",llaumef,wallstreetbets,1.0

0,2018-01-07,"Yeah your strategy sounds pretty solid and somewhat similar to mine. I have 2 different types of spreads I'll use. If it's on an index like SPY QQQ or a sector etf I will typically short a delta of around 0.1 about 2 weeks out and the long depends on what I feel is the best at the time. But for SPY I typically aim for a 0.10-0.20 spread and I'll usually sell about 80-100 of those. So it uses a decent amount of capital but it rarely stops out in this market so it's still worth it to me. For that trade I will stop out if I lose 2x what I stand to gain, so for a 0.1 spread I'll stop if it widens to 0.3. Since the trade has such a heavy chance of going in my favour I'm fine with risking more capital. For that one I'll also let it expire worthless unless it stops out since the commissions are high on those. 

But for spreads on stocks I will base the spread off of the stock rebounding off a support or resistance whether I'm going bull or bear. So in this case the delta are usually pretty high on the short, like around 0.4 or so but this is fine because over a large amount of trades I still profit because of theta decay as well as credit spreads basically just being rigged to the seller's advantage. 

And for those trades I don't base the stop off of an amount lost, I base it off of the underlying going below/above a certain price. So I play those basically exactly as I would going long or short commons or long options, just have theta on my side instead is the main difference. 

Examples of a couple of the recent trades for the start of 2018 that I've already closed out were SBUX, JNJ, MMM, HON, SQ, SPY. MMM was a dick though and went low during the day, stopped me out, then climbed back up so that was unfortunate, but the other 3 all paid out for me. For sizing those positions though I usually go for $700 credit because I expect to usually pay roughly $100 in commission and close out the spread when it has around $100 left so I'm left with around $500 from a successful position. 

I'll be honest though, it's refreshing talking to someone on here that understands what they're doing and aren't just gambling for the fk of it. 

But so far 2018 has been great to me, I've made half of what I made in December in the first week alone, so hopefully this continues!",CainRedfield,wallstreetbets,0.0
1,2018-01-07,"I mean sure but the point is that if you had 10% bonds going into 2008 and bought the dip of BAC you'd have effectively doubled your shares than if you just held BAC. Obviously that's retarded to be 100% BAC but point is generally true.

Rebalancing in a recession is one of the easiest ways to get tons of #gains. Unfortunately during a recession a lot of people lose their jobs etc. but if you have a secure income source, or could scale back your expenses as needed/have minimal debt it makes sense to risk it.

Right now I have a good chunk in general shit like QQQ/FDGRX and probably too much in alibaba right now lol. Also a bit in SOXL. Also like 2 shares of MJX because funny. But that doesn't represent a big portion of my portfolio it's mostly for fun. 

I'm stupidly bullish mostly because I actually will prolly make more money in a market collapse than if it continues going upward (Significant equity I don't mind yolo'ing into stock market but would want to wait for a true dip/recession to do so). 

That being said if we have another insane year (20%) SPY I might go like 40% bonds just because it'd seem pretty stupid at that point.

4,2018-01-07,Yeah the S&amp;P 500 isn't that volatile compared to gold or natural gas it's mostly commodities or individual sectors that see the a lot of vol drag. Unless the sector has basically gone straight up in the last 5 years like QQQ and SOXX. Honestly the risk reward setup is really good for UPRO. Best case scenario you gain 1200% like the last 8 years and worst case (long volatile bear market) you lose most of your investment. That's not a bad bet,VPride1995,wallstreetbets,4.0
5,2018-01-07,"If a stock goes down 10% from 100 to 90 and then goes up 10% it would hit 99, right? If it’s 3x leveraged it goes down to 70, up to 91. However if the stock goes up 10% and then again 10%, you would have 121 with original stock and 169 with the leveraged (aka more than 3x gains).

Maybe I’m retarded but I basically see leveraged etfs as outperforming in low volatility increasing markets and underperforming in high volatility sideways markets.

0,2018-01-09,"Here's a strategy I like that I am trying out (but should probably backtest, and probably won't). Hold deep-in-the-money LEAP calls on whatever index you want constant exposure to, and hold some funds in cash. DITM calls have very little time value as a proportion of capital invested, and LEAPS burn time value very slowly. If QQQ goes up, you'll have exposure to all of the delta via your LEAP. If QQQ crashes, then the LEAPS will still retain some of their value and the fraction of their value which is time value will increase (probably so will implied volatility, giving an even greater time / risk premium) - if you think its done crashing, you can either adjust your LEAPS, or go in on QQQ. The problematic scenario is one where nothing much happens over the next year, in which case QQQ doesn't really go up and you still burn time value. Volatility has been historically ridiculously low for a while now, I think a slow-motion, whole-market meltdown is the least likely occurrence, and it would be painful for absolutely everyone.

Theta is a consequence of the black-scholes options pricing model (its not real) and LETF beta decay is a pure mathematical consequence of daily re-leveraging.

You’re attempting to diversify but missing the whole point of it. If you’re going to do something like this you’d probably be better off going with something like 40% VOO and calculate how much exposure you already have to the top Nasdaq 100 companies in QQQ, and adjust accordingly.. a mixture like 40% VOO, 10-15% QQQ, (or find a fund with a cheaper expense ratio ex. FTEC) and then diversify the rest 45-50% in international and small/mid cap stocks. That is if you’re going for 100% equity exposure. Look into beta weighting your portfolio too. Right now you’re likely at: (0.5 * 1.00) * (0.25 * 1.15 ) + (0.25 * 3.76) = 1.7275. To give you an idea, the beta of the market is roughly 1.0.

Just cross reference with the hourly, 1 day, 2 day, 5 day, 10 day, monthly and 3 month according to what type of trade you're making.

Its by no means a sure-fire way to make money but it can give you confidence that entering at the right time has a slightly higher probability of going in your favour.

Also, before you make any trades - learn to read the tape.  Ie.  watch the price action on the stocks and see how they behave.  Then cross check individual stocks to larger indexes like the S&amp;P, DIJA and, for example, QQQ if youre looking at a tech stock.  Then, make sure to cross check the VIX for correlations and trends there.

Make them 80 days out and way out of the money strikes.

Example - Buy Strike $152 QQQ puts with 60-80 days expire, and then just trade normally just always having those as backup crash protectors.

24,2018-05-01,"You keep talking about dollar amounts then switching to percent.... if you made $400 in a few minutes off of investing $100 into options that's one thing, but if you put $2k in and made $400 that's different (one great one good, but for reference it helps).

Also you put 5/4 270.5 calls... is this for SPY?

My advice is to learn from your mistakes.  Don't put more than you can accept to risk into a single transaction.  Sure you limit your gain potential, but you also limit your lose.  Don't keep throwing money at a loser... once it became clear it wouldn't happen you should've stopped ""averaging down"" (which only works if you have more and more money to play with PLUS you think the position will pay off before expiration).  Actually you could probably have bought some puts instead and maybe averaged out flat/low loss.  Don't think ""every time will be a winner"" because if you're hitting 50/50 or slightly better my guess is you're slightly above average for an ""at home"" investor.  Also buy ITM calls, don't screw around with OTM especially with a low account balance where a single option contract can make/break you.  Also maybe it's time to consider paper trading until you have ""your plan"" figured out.

Or just dump in $200 and then bet yet again on SPY or QQQ going the way you want and will have big movements.  Repeat 2-3x and if you win each time you'll be back at $2k in no time.  *Don't do this*

0,2018-05-04,"List some of your trades/strike/options plays and we can tell you why you shouldn't have done that and maybe try to see why you lost all that.

I should know something by now as I've lost $16,000-20,000 now.. But I'm still fine and recently have been changing some of my ways of trading and it's working (as you'll see in my recent posts)

I know now to wait for opportunities instead of trying to fight to force them..   Yesterday we had a huge run down of 400 points on the Dow, then quickly all the way back up. 

That was one of the opportunities to wait for. I only caught some of it, but if it tries to do that again, I'm going full tilt on a 0-day option play If I see that again.  but in general you have to be watching the market 24-7, which I am lucky enough to be able to do.

Since most people can't watch the market 24-7, I am no expert by any means, but having now seen what kinda happens over time, I would wait till you hear about some huge red down day and ""the dow is down 400 points"" on the news, and buy as many shares as you can in a ETF Index fund.

and let is sit then. check it periodically.

If you do have time to check it more often and want to trade more often, then perhaps try buying 1 week options on $SPY, $QQQ etc, and only after you see/hear about a big dip/drop or terrible day in the market.

You would buy right after you think the dip/drop is at the bottom and or at 3:55pm if you see the market is down alot. Then buy the 1 week option and close it within the next day or within 2-3 days if you think it will continue up.


*side note- it's probably better to buy longer than 1-week options for you, maybe like 2 weeks - 1 month long expiring options. But key is to buy them after big drops or run-ups.  You need to purchase options when premiums are trying to adjust to whatever just happened. 

Also to me, it's preferable to close options more quickly then letting them run, so if you see profit that you are happy with, or even 10-30% up, I'd go ahead and close it. Because the market is there to screw you, not give you free money, remember that, it's a business and they want money, your money.

8,2018-05-09,"It looks like I buy a lot of calls, but tbh my strategy is more variable-net. In this current market environment, my decision (to go net long vs neutral/short) was primarily driven with top-down analysis, and I chose the single-names based off bottoms-up. Someone else asked how I avoided the ""volocaust"" of February - that's because at that time, I didn't think it made sense to be net-long, and I actually had more puts/shorts than I had calls.

The only reason I'm net long at the moment is because I think there's a lot of untapped beta that will bolster returns going forward. I am not claiming I'm at all the best single-name stock picker, but I think the current market environment is such that beta will boost all long bets; a rising tide raises all ships. I think one could easily do just as well buying calls on the QQQ, but I used my judgement on which single-names might accelerate faster than others.

My top-down view was based off 1. the pullback of CTAs from equity markets since February, resulting in long-depressed volumes, and 2. strong but non-reactionary earnings, resulting in valuation compression going forward. If you truly believed that we're on the cusp of a correction, valuation compression could possibly be the ""new normal"", however, my perspective was that once the market was more at ease with the earnings releases, volume would come back, CTAs / risk-parity funds might re-enter the space further bolstering momentum.

In terms of exit, my strategy is to hold until valuation reaches pre-compression levels.",wellbespoke,wallstreetbets,8.0

Your example is true but consider a stock that starts at $100 a share, the non leveraged goes up 2% for two days in a row it. It would end up at $104.04. So the 3x leveraged should be at 112.12, right? 3 times the gains minus the $100 starting price, but it's actually $112.36.

0,2018-06-02,"Probably just gonna sit pat with the calls I have currently. Picked up 6/29 MSFT calls at open today that are already up a good bit, and am bagholding some MU calls. Depending on how those go, I may roll them into more aggressive strikes, but other than that I don't see myself changing my positions substantially this week.

If I had enough uninvested funds to make plays this week, I'd probably go for SPY/QQQ puts through wednesday (market went up a ton today across the board, and I think we see a pullback, especially depending on the tariff bullshit that's afoot) or 8/17 V calls (not sure of the exact strike I'd do for that, but either 135 pr 130 looks solid to me, depending on your risk tolerance). V essentially broke even on a day the market went up a ton due to temporary factors, and I firmly believe it will make that up and more. Furthermore, they'll have their ER coming up sometime in July likely, and V historically wrecks those. 

Alternatively, if you're planning on holding off, I think long term SPY calls may reap some serious gains. We've been trading sideways at ~270 for nearly 5 months now despite great earnings and largely good market conditions. If tweetledumb will fucking forget about starting stupid ass trade wars with every country on the planet, I think there's a solid chance of a breakout to ~285 by the end of the summer, with an outside chance of hitting 300 by end of year.

Personally I think the *market* assumes that USA will keep trading with its closest allies and congress will stop anything truly insane from happening.  So I don’t think the market will move at all based on the G7 show, or if it does I think SP500 drops more than 3%, so yes a drop but not *FUUUUUUUUCK MEEEE* kind of drop.  As for the NK summit I don’t think anyone thinks President Trump will get everything he wants, but probably some timeline for NK denuclearization and a timeline for inspections of the progress and a meeting down the road where some sort of treaty will be negotiated for removing sanctions from NK as long as the inspections are OK.  So if Trump walks out with a deal like I’ve mentioned, I do think the markets will react favorably, but short of armed conflict resuming in Korea I don’t think things will get too shitty.  If he walks out with everything he demanded going in, I think we might get one of the best up days/weeks for the SP500 has ever had *not* following a monster drop.

If the USA stops trading with its allies or there’s a trade war between USA and EU/Canada, the markets are going to absolutely shit the bed with SP500 moves rivaling what we saw in 2008, at least in the intraday.

If you are less certain you can get closer to the money puts (even same dollar amount you’d spend on far OTM, just less contracts) 1/3rd or half of duration of the long. 

That said, I believe exposure to 3 ER’s for NFLX with 1/19/19 expiry (sub 500 strikes) have high probability of success. 

Time left on contracts adds intrinsic value that doesn’t erode as quick as a negatively changing delta. 

More often than not they’ll do great on a well chosen stock and entry. Long dated doesn’t mean have to hold till expiry and just lets you have patience/no pressure on the search for optimal exits. 

Scalping FD’s can be really profitable is why people do. Potentially as much or moreso than longer dated position in matter of minutes or hours. I use RSI and Bollinger Bands (and eye on QQQ/rest of market + recent price action history) as my top indicators for a good entry on a scalp. Chart for ideas on mental stops.

Surprisingly, in many cases, this portfolio even has higher Sharpe and Sortino ratios than QQQ and SPY.  All percentages are CAGR (annualized returns).  Format:  *\[Asian Tigers \% Return / QQQ \% Return / SPY \% Return\]*

7,2018-07-11,"put spreads. So on QQQ I sold 10 170.5 puts, and bought 10 170 puts with a 2 week expiry. This gives me a spread with a maximum loss of $500 (10x$50 each) and usually gives me a credit around $170. So the maximum I can lose on this position is $330, and if I sell at my 60% rule then I will make about $100. Seems like not much but it's similar to buying a call that costs $300 and hoping to make a profit on it, except that with the put spread (or put vertical, it has a lot of different names) you now have theta working for you instead of against you.

**Technically a credit put spread is the equivalent of buying 100 shares of stock, selling a covered call, and then using those funds to buy a more-OTM protective put.** This generates a fixed amount of income on the upside, and limits your downside risk. The benefit to doing a put spread is the reduction in capital needed to open the position. For example, 100 shares of QQQ is $17,500. Or I can open an equivalent position with put spreads and only use $50 of capital per spread... now, in WSB fashion, just do this on margin with a cash-advance from your credit card and you'll be set!

I feel like your rules are “i messed up with this, and I messed up with that.” instead of actual rules. Good start but the rules have to be more dispassionate, I can sense frustration behind every rule. 

For example, some of my rules:

-Check 3 min RSI

-Look for FD trades on Wednesday/Thursday especially - i.e 2 or 1 DTE. 

-Check QQQ before I enter big names.

1,2018-08-04,"I never said they wouldn’t reach $1T. In fact, I was almost certain they would following earnings. It’s not like they had far to go from 0.96T and investors are getting confident again. If you had Apple calls then good on you, I hope you made a lot of money. You might want to consider selling soon. You took decent risk and got paid for it, that’s how the market is supposed to work. As for my call, I told you exactly when the Nasdaq was going to fall, and it did, immediately after my comment. I brought my high risk account up 72% in 3 days when I closed my QQQ and SPY puts around noon on Tuesday, and I’ve been all cash since then. I clearly saw that the move lower was losing steam on Tuesday and I got out. 

Downside moves don’t happen often, but when they do they are large and swift, just like the recoveries which follow (see: fri, mon, thurs, fri). 

I will concede that the past 2 weeks, 2800 has been the strongest and most consistent support I have seen on SPX all year. I wasn’t expecting that at all. Every single time we hit it or futures dipped below, SPX snapped back to 28xx like a rubber band. It provided a lot of great opportunities for dip buyers. Good for them, that is not how I invest. 

I’ll let spx head to 2873 (all time high) again before I build up short positions, at this point it pretty much feels like it’s inevitable. If you want to take the risk and keep buying calls in the single most overbought market in history, during what has become the second longest bull market in history, after the inflation-adjusted return on the Nasdaq just eclipsed the dot-com bubble, then go for it. Most people buying equities now have no perspective at all and just don’t know what the fuck they’re buying, but if you understand al this and still want to keep buying calls then good for you, you’ve got balls of steel. History has shown that returns to the upside right before bubbles burst can be phenomenal (see: Jan 2018, 1999/2000, early 1987 before Oct.)

That being said, we will see a recession in FY19. Maybe we can push it to 2020 but I really fucking doubt it. I think sept of this year will make it a little more obvious where we are headed. It may very well be the start of the bloodbath, or we’ll pass by the 10yr anniversary of the largest global financial crisis in history as the yield curve is inverting again without so much as a hiccup. Yield curve inversion is still set to occur by October. 

That said, until we get complacent enough to hit all time highs again on SPX, it’s a green light for the bulls and good luck to you with your calls. If you play it right you’ll be able to make a lot of money. Just make sure you factor in the possibility of an overnight -10 to 20% move when you are buying calls and determining your risk profile, otherwise you could get destroyed in a 1987 situation. Risk management from this point onward will separate the wheat from the chaff and determine future returns.",dylanx300,wallstreetbets,1.0

Honestly, I used to love swing trading and occasional options about two years ago and this sub was a daily read for me. Then life got busy and I really didn't have the time for any of that anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I still come back to this sub every once in a while, but using Robinhood, with a bit of margin, to hold NVDA, AMD, MSFT, and AMZN for roughly the last year and a half has proven to be the best strategy for me, by far.

To pay homage to my wsb roots and keep things interesting, I've bee holding a sprinkling of TQQQ for about as long. Definitely not a bad way to spend a hundred bucks.

In general for MU

SPY/QQQ drops = 2% drop

MU downgrade = 5% drop

Sector downgrade = 3% drop

Chinese tariff news = 3% drop (even if it’s old news being reiterated)

Good news about/for MU = 1% gain

If *nothing* else happens following these movements MU will rebound 1-2% after a few days.  Problem is we’ve been getting these downgrades and news events nearly weekly so as soon as MU starts moving positively it gets whacked again.  So really MU being down 2.3% based on memory getting a downgrade for WDC is actually a pretty good combination of sector downgrade plus good news about MU.  I still think $51.50 for today is likely (2% drop from Friday close) and then a slow rise back to $52.50 for Friday absent of any other bad news.

Thing is MU will never buck the sector or the market, but it also gets next to nothing positive from sector upgrades

Red SPY/NQ/QQQ means red MU

Downgrade for any of the memory players, means red MU

Memory market is stronger than we anticipated means no impact on MU

MU upgrade from multiple analysts means no impact on MU

There is a sort of diminishing returns (losses) on multiple red days; however, the percentages do compound. This is what people call leveraged decay, but it works in favor in a bull market. If qqq gained 0.1% everyday and tqqq gained 0.3% everyday, tqqq would exponentially grow faster than qqq and you would see the divergence you see today (tqqq gave way more than just 3x returns in the past 10 years). The same goes for a bear market though. I copy pasted daily data from the Nasdaq comp going back to '87 (I know qqq is Nasdaq 100) but they are similar enough. I then multiplied the daily % gains or losses by 3 to simulate what it would look like if there was a x3 leveraged index for the Nasdaq comp during bear markets.

last week sell off in main indices like qqq and spy finally showed up and that also didnt get bounced...1st line of defense is usually the 100 Day MA on the daily..if the indices don't atleast hover around there or bounce up cleanly back to normal trajectory, then to me, theres downside potential as buyers are not stepping up and interested in entering long positions at this point...so thats when i looked into some short term puts to hedge..

also outside noise was strong this time - yields at new highs (3.2% is pretty attractive to a lot of ""safe"" investors so i can definitely see why they would sell stocks and go for the guarantee 3.2%)...trade war tension still amuck, EU banking contagion fear, feds being too hawkish, etc. 

seems like a pretty good recipe for a sell off if you ask me when you combine it with the fact we have been printing new highs for the last few months now...

1,2018-11-10,"You want to do a straddle, which I think I read you already did and it worked but you didn't close it right? 

So therefore, do another straddle but buy only when the bid/ask on both the puts and calls are very very near the same.

Like both a call and a put costs 10.20 or whatever price but they both need to be around the same. Also buy it for 6 months. Do this with a few puts/calls straddle and then if you have the capital, just add more puts/calls as you see fit in the direction that you think the market is going. But add very slowly and only probably at 3:59pm. Each day check it. 

Remember that you can do straddles on everything and anything you see is in a middle spot, or even for things like QQQ. which might help because it follows Apple closely too.  

Or if you have margin, buy shares after big drops on anything, I mean big big drops and then just buy a few puts after any huge run ups and day trade options. I don't like options and the bullshit manipulation they pull on them. Decay, theta, implied volatilty and totally pricing in all the shit they do is sick on options to make them worthless so fast. 

anyway, straddle or Covered calls is the way to go.

You can also buy spreads on each side.  a CAll spread and a Put spread.. that way you can help with the theta crap they pull on you and implied volatility garbage.

Apple OTM calls, QQQ OTM puts probably a 1:2 ratio. Apple jumps, QQQ will likely gain by that amount or less, so my QQQ puts won't be affected as much as my Apple calls are. Apple drops, my calls go to shit, but because I have twice as many QQQ puts, it ends up evening out. The strikes are all gut feeling or price-dependent, nothing insightful or Quant-like there.

I agree with so much of your thesis. I’d like to add to your positioning on tech: Q4 isn’t going to be pretty. The big guns of AAPL, NVDA, INTC, AMD, AMAT, MU all have issues and/or anticipate a slowdowns moving forward. The larger picture is that we have broke away from Moore’s Law. It’s taking longer than 2 years to reach the next proverbial peg in design/performance. In the case of Intel, we are well behind their original timetable for smaller, more powerful chips. Similar stories for those in the tech/semi fields. On the consumer side, I think we’ve reached a tipping point regarding product pricing (AAPL and NVDA specifically). Less innovation or bang-for-your-buck. Enough product generations of this + rising prices = lower sales.

Tech companies that also provide some form of commerce grab my attention. AMZN, EBAY, SQ.

I have mixed feelings about how to play tech as a whole. I’m not sure if it’s better to go after a tech-centric etf like QQQ (holds a high % of AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, INTC, etc) or target the likes of AMD, AMAT,  NVDA directly. Post-Christmas dates for options look attractive right now.

20,2018-11-12,"Firstly I wouldn't buy such short dated options if you can afford longer dated.  3 months is a good rule of thumb as that gives your position time to recover.  Also, when purchasing calls/puts generally its a pretty good idea to do a spread.  Yes spreads cap your upside but they also prevent the bleed that is theta burn and you can make spreads pretty wide.  You're mostly in tech right now.  AAPL, SQ, AMZN(not tech but is priced as a crazy growth company), NFLX, ES(not tech but broadly correlated).  If you want to keep your portfolio the same and just control the risk then I'd sell some legs to turn all your calls into spreads and Id look at opening maybe one or two shorts.  You could look into a QQQ put as a hedge against your entire portfolio.  In order to give more suggestions I need to know your outlook.  I dont like giving blatant buy/sell advice because your account value is larger than mine, but I'm personally a bear.  An idea might be you could do covered calls on all your shares until value returns.  APPL and SQ are both volatile enough to likely have good OTM options you can sell.",Negido,wallstreetbets,20.0

Sized down all my positions and started making smaller plays, taking profit while trying to time my buys and sells to avoid PDT. Apple, Microsoft, VXX, QQQ calls/puts. Started making decent, steady gains. Then I played CRM calls for earnings(after being totally violated by them in October), and finally had the balls to play Amazon.

4,2018-12-08,"Yeah you're exactly right: higher beta means that you can be a bit later in catching a trend because it might go for longer (it's not guaranteed ofc but on average that's the case).

I stick to ES/SPY because there's more eyes on it and I feel like I have a better understanding of its price levels. I mainly use NQ/QQQ for hedging an ES/SPY position (e.g. if I'm long ES but feel the need to hedge I'll go short NQ because of its higher beta, meaning I can be a bit late on the hedge because its potentially larger move will compensate for my late entry, if that makes sense).

In general if you're really interested in scalping then trading futures is required imo. With SPY/QQQ the commissions and bid/ask spread will really eat into your potential profits. Also you can get higher leverage with futures.

At least 75% of moves in any given stock are tied to overall market conditions. By sticking to the indexes, you get rid of some inconsistencies that can ruin your plays, like analyst upgrades, ceo tweets news, overall emotional feelings about a company, etc. Plus you get the benefit of liquidity which can’t be underestimated. You can unload at anytime and get the fair price. If you aren’t on faggothood, stop orders can take advantage of liquidity and help lock in profits while letting you keep a lot of upside.

18,2018-12-08,"Owned for about 7 months. The payout will vary and I don’t have full confidence but right now volatility is back and so the premiums should be good on the strategy. But again, it will vary along with the price of the fund so as I said, if you can deal with the tied up capital and the ups and downs, it’s a good buy. Their payout history looks good. It’s not just covered call premium, their payout includes the dividends of the stock ownership as well. So I expect some really good months and some ok months but I’ll hold for many years. Eventually, NASDAQ will come back and cost basis will be much lower. Right now I’m only off by about $0.20 from my purchase price. Been buying on the way down. 

It’s just diversification for me. I still sell my own cash secured puts and covered calls on dividend stocks like QQQ but I own QYLD as a set/forget part of my portfolio. 

Also it has a 0.6% expense ratio. So a $10000 investment will cost $60 back to the fund yearly at the time they execute the expense. 

Finally, they are reorganizing the fund this December. Everything will stay the same but they are moving the ticker I believe as part of the Horizons -&gt; Global X conversion.

9,2018-12-12,"I believe its because of this volatile market. All the DD goes out of the window. Tell me when did we even look at SPY,QQQ for calls in June? Our darlings were SQ, V, MSFT and then AMZN fds. Hell I traded Mastercard between 200 and 210 around 5-6 times for easy 2-3k.

If I can go back to that market of BTFD I would just do that. Short term would buy Thursday/Friday calls and sell Wednesday EOD and pick a lotto put just for Thursday selling. Give me that back with all the rich discussions.
