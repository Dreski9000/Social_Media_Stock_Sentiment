People look at Apple as a boring (but safe) blue chip tech stock. So when they are seen as working on something ‚Äúdifferent‚Äùthe markets react positively.

I don't think there is a calculator that can show you how options would be valued overtime since there are far too many variables affecting them but let's say you were to buy 16th Sep 2022 $135 CALL on AAPL you'd have to pay about $2385 and your breakeven would be $158.85. Which is about 20% from current levels. That means each $1 increase after $158.85 would net you $100 profit per contract. If the price ends up going to $175 in 2 years, you'll make $1615 in profit, about $65%.

The better question is, is that worth doing and basically locking capital for 21 months or so.

Sold ENPH at $40 before Feb earnings, went to $60 after earnings.

Went all in AAPL / MSFT in Feb 21 (hey, at last a dip..), just before the market crash. The following 3 months were a once in a lifetime experience.
I sold for profit in early June, while I was trapped, ENPH went to $22 and back to $70.

FOMOED into TSLA at $900 after it had multiple +10% days, the moment I bought it dropped like 100+ points in 30sec. Used a stop loss, back to $250 or $2000 was anyone's guess.

Started a position in ENPH at $56, Prescience Point came and I doubled down at $38.

104,2021-01-02,"This autist is absolutely spot on.

iPhone sales were all crammed into the quarter just finished and the upcoming ER will crush YoY. That is a given and Tim and Luca said as much in the last EC.

The long online store delivery times for products and with multiple product lines out of stock in stores across the world is because demand for iPhones, iPads, and Macs were through the roof in the Covid landscape. Factories in China have been up and running at full speed for a good nine months or so so it‚Äôs not due to supply-side constraints. Global demand for Apple‚Äôs products has been stratospheric.

With the lack of stock for these products, Apple will have been selling wearables by the boatload. Apple Watch and AirPods hit the spot price-wise for holiday season gifting and have not had issues with stock.

The super cycle has been in full swing and the Pro phones this year have made more people switch from other ecosystems, and upgrade their older iPhones. The new design language, coupled with upgraded cameras, and a lower comparable price to the previous generation of iPhones, have made the Pro-level iPhones extremely popular this year.

TL:DR Apple is going to crush earnings next ER.

Can't do bull spreads, to small of money and fear of assignment.  

SAFE- Shares and sell during the spike on runup. If no spike, hold and sell AH/PM if it spikes. That means you need an account that trades during those hours.  

Risky but MAX GAIN- 1/15 24c, catch the IV during the week, and get out as it runs up, even if it heading into close on Wed. But do not hold past ER. I don't believe shorts will hold into ER.  

Also, paid stock upgrades are starting to drip, leading me to believe it is possible shorts will try to cover tomorrow. Watch volume at open. If it increases and the price still drops to 12-16, you will know there will be no squeeze. They need to be caught off guard and be trapped after open.

41,2021-01-04,"I actually don't think PLTR are bad people and I probably wouldn't invest if I did. I don't hold or trade or entertain any positions in defense. Same is true for oil.

PLTR works with both of those industries, likely because they are some of the most historically bloated industries in the world. Decades of no bid contracts, anti competition, govt subsidies, and political protections have enabled wasteful spending &amp; gluttonous dividends. These habits protect complacency within hiring and management hierarchies and created a near perfect entry for papa Thiel and Alex Karp.

PLTR is just an enterprise data OS, but they get a bad wrap because of the aforementioned terry hunting and outspoken usage of big data. MSFT &amp; GOOG &amp; AAPL all do similar stuff with data, but they aren't ""mysterious"" systems explicitly linked to profiting from killing terrys. They are simply more understood by the average consumer, and create the illusion of data privacy protections between systems.

I think PLTR is a good platform because at the core it's an efficiency platform. Yes it has fancy tech and software but it seems to do three things very well:

\- simplify the software stack

\- create business intelligence analysts from workforces with low technical skills

\- deploy engineers who enable rapid setup and user onboarding",LN-beanzo,wallstreetbets,41.0

That's why if you look at the poorest nations in the world almost all of them suffer from a poorly defined or corrupt financial system. If you can't trust that your investment is legitimate then you are less likely to invest.

Now does me buying a share of AAPL from someone else create wealth? Not really but being in a public market has absolutely created wealth for AAPL holders and the company itself which can now generate more capital by selling more stock. They've expanded the number of potential shareholders from a few billionaires to everyone. As a whole the stock market is a good thing for society as ordinary people can own a slice of large businesses and profit when they do well.

There is one main difference I can see though. In September we had been on an ungodly moonshot all through August and it ended up with insane buying the last few days of the run with AAPL hitting a very brief high of $137. Everything had been insanely overbought for days or even weeks.

I would in a HEARTBEAT if possible but we aren‚Äôt renting PS5 / Xbox here. Yes, games can be downloaded. But here‚Äôs the catch: physical copies cost just as much as digital downloads for the most part, but digital downloads don‚Äôt come with collectibles and rare goodies. To you? May not seem important, but many gamers prefer owning not just a disk, but the art that comes with it.

Then you have the merch specifically gamer focused. Any fool with Wix can slap graphics on a shirt and sell it. But to see it, feel it, and know you didn‚Äôt expect Tom Nook or Keanu Reeves to be on your merch? That‚Äôs why I went to get a Pikachu plushie for my baby girl and the whole damn store was EMPTY. 

I felt like a terrible father not getting it sooner but I put all my money into $SPY / $AAPL / $GME leaps. My daughter deserves a better future than daddy working for shit wages and never being home.

Point is, $GME is not like Kohl‚Äôs, Macy‚Äôs or Sears where you sell everything to try to get something. It‚Äôs hyper focused on what gamers want and not enough is said about how gamers don‚Äôt just buy games. Most of you here who own Cyberpunk would go nuts seeing a Judy or Panam collectible doll. Or maybe Johnny Silverhand. 

I love shopping at GameStop because a staff that‚Äôs passionate and knowledgeable can tip me off when a rare game comes in and I‚Äôm into nostalgia. Cheap used copies? Preowned consoles to experiment with modding? Releases the same price as downloads that as a Power Member, come with extra goodies?

You don‚Äôt get to the moon without some accidents along the way.

&gt;Even if we both agree that they are 4 sectors in one. If you took all 4 of those divisions and broke them into 4 standalone companies, I don't believe the valuation of all 4 as a stand alone company would add to the value Tesla is currently trading at. 

Does this work for any big company? Like if you broke apple into a phone company, a tablet. Company, a watch company, etc I doubt it would get close to their market cap.

Could probably do the same with Microsoft. 

I'm not really a Tesla bull, but I think evaluating by splitting into smaller pieces makes you lose the fact that all of these technologies being bundled into one company has value in itself. 

For consumer products it's the ol apple slogan ""it just works."" For enterprise IT products it's similar to how Microsoft is huge because they sell a product for literally everything and enterprises don't like buying from a new company if they can help it.

People are betting on TSLA becoming an eco system I think. Not in the same way msft or aapl is but some new way.

If you are Theta gang, you can earn a lot more premium with in a week with $12k on other stuff. 3% for a month and a half of work is so-so.

Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth.

Bulls win and get richer but money doesn't mean anything. If everyone has money then there's no special power, no special privilege. They're rich just like everybody else.

20,2021-01-09,"AAPL, GOOG, AMZN have all been trying FSD for a decade now and have fuck all to show for it. It's the holy grail of tech and anyone who thinks the time and safety benefits, for consumer and logistical use, aren't already worth trillions of dollars has their head up their ass. Think about what percentage of time modern civilization spends driving, the loss of life involved, the amount of money circulating in logistics.

Only one company is finding success with a version of FSD that will ever be usable outside of the most meticulously mapped and updated major cities. Machine learning isn't something that's easy to rip off or replicate, it takes years and years of meticulous training and programming. This one company has also gone all-in on full vertical integration and ownership of all components of its products, making the most outlandish and bullish bet on the aforementioned multi-trillion dollar market that doesn't exist yet. They use highest grade marketing materials and an emphasis on perfect UI design like the current most valuable company in the world. The hardware doesn't need to be great to have sky high profit margins and shit all over competitors just like Apple does to Google.

Tesla is going to multiply several times over in the next five years and still be undervalued. It's like if Henry Ford had been poised to dominate the oil, shipping, and consumer transportation industries in one go. All bears can talk about is retarded QC issues from a company that was desperately trying to stay alive against massive political machinations, short sellers, and competition from the most valuable tech companies in the world. That company can now raise $5B at a time, blip their holders' share price 1%, and nobody gives a singular fuck.

You might notice that different areas of the market get excited at different times, and that JPM and a bunch of energy companies have been dragging the indices up lately while AAPL underperforms.

On top of that we have all these stimulus packages going to people/businesses who don't need them and are not spending money due to quarantine. Everyone, institutions and retail alike, can take out low interest debt/margin to leverage their stock positions because everything is outperforming interest. Even Robinhood is giving out 2.5% margin rates.   

Sure some companies took on debt, but a lot of companies are in extremely financially healthy positions. TSLA could pay down their entire debt balance with their cash balance. Even AAPL was ""only"" a 500B company like 4 years ago and is now 2T even though nothing has fundamentally changed drastically.

Maybe hydrogen fuel-cells become realistic and infrastructure is built to deliver it, so you get emission-free autos without worrying about distance limitations

I'm not saying Tesla can't be the winner at the end. I'm just saying a lot of people are looking at Tesla with blinders on and can't imagine an alternative / different picture, which is a dangerous way to trade

Also, I would argue that while there are a lot of Tesla fanatics out there - question is how many of them can actually buy / afford a Tesla today?

The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of.

143,2021-01-08,"Here‚Äôs the thing‚Äîwhere else would you put your money other than the stock market? Bonds are trash and earn a low return. You can‚Äôt just park it in a bank account. Sure, you could buy property and rent it out but you are relying on property markets to continue to go up in value. And that‚Äôs hard to estimate right now due to everyone working at home. The world‚Äôs elite know this‚Äîforeign investors aren‚Äôt buying property in their own country or even in their own stock exchanges. There‚Äôs a capitalist revolution going on right now and you can have a slice of the pie if you have the capital to start.

Yes, there are bubbles. Tesla probably being one of them. And conventional valuations no longer make sense. However, we have companies that are drastically changing our world. More than Ford did in the 1900s. I can literally sit on my fat ass, order any product I want and it will be delivered in two days. There‚Äôs serious innovation happening right now and it‚Äôs impossible to put a dollar amount on the value of that right now.

The plan is to sell puts with cash sitting in your account and hopefully you never get the shares assigned to you!

If you do get the shares assigned to you, not a huge problem, just sell covered calls on those shares until one of your covered calls hits and your shares get called away 

As for a ticker, you want to pick one that you can afford (obviously) younneed that cash for the ticker price x 100, and you'll want to be able to do more than one contract at a time. Depends how much money you have.

You also want something pretty stable not some stupid meme stock, or something that's bullish, so... right now that's hard with the crazy market but a decent example would be... MT, F, AAPL (if it wasnt expensive), CCL, NCLH (these may go down slightly but are really solid and will definitely go up long term)

Large growth names comprise the majority of the indexes, and imo they won't perform very well and we'll see factor rotation into value and out of growth. Big names like AAPL MSFT etc. may not get hit as bad as, say, $ZM $PTON or $TSLA, but I'm of the belief that we see a large rotation into value. And once that inflation becomes a reality, Powell will raise interest rates, and the TINA effect will be no longer as we see money start to pour into bonds once again in the future (not near term, more like 2022+). The fact that long term rates are not only increasing since the GA dem sweep, but *accelerating*, is a cause for worry for names with bloated valuations. The tech bubble popped and the market got crushed while earnings continued to grow, price is not a function of growth rates, it's a function of valuations which are largely dependent on long term rates for those big growth companies.",huskythrowaway123123,wallstreetbets,15.0

59,2021-01-11,"If you want to increase your leverage in a non-retarded way you could hold part of your bank in shares and play options with the remainder. I like using long dated call debit spreads. Buy one call maybe 5-10% out of the money and sell another call 20-50% out of the money. This reduces the premium you have to pay, and therefore risk, but will also limit the maximum gain.

For example I recently bought an AAPL debit call spread. I bought the 140 call for $500 and sold the 160 call for $150, bringing the cost of my position down to about $350, but also limiting the max value of the spread to $2000 (the difference between the two strikes x100) turning $350 into 2k in 2 months or less is plenty of upside for me.

Its always good I think to leave some cash on the sidelines when playing with options. That way you can average down your position, buy some puts if there's a major downturn, and yolo retarded FDs on meme stocks based on seeing üöÄüöÄüöÄ in some autistic DD posted by random strangers on the internet.

But 50x contracts would only see an increase in fees and not commission and would total $16.79. Hope that makes sense.

518,2021-01-12,"Sure. If you understand the risk premium on a CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model) you know that the stocks yield more but have higher risks. The people are ready to take the risk because they find these returns more attractive as compared to risk free investments like government bonds. IF the govt bonds start yielding better values than they traditionally have been, people may pull money out of the stocks and park it in the risk free bonds. This in turn will stress both the treasury and the market together. That's exactly what the article is postulating. 

I personally see it as just fear mongering. The basis points jump will in no way be comparable to a stock yield in the market. AAPL for instance grows by 4% on a good day...a day... the YoY yield on a bond can never match that.",CallNPut,wallstreetbets,518.0

all big tech cash flows heavily, which gives them very high optionality in the real world of business. 

even though higher corporate &amp; uber-wealthy taxes are coming, buying the dip on big tech (MSFT / AAPL / FB / GOOG) is the right play.

I bought SPY and AAPL calls this week which lost 30% value. Sold half of those contracts and bought some 10x leaps for PLUG. Was gonna just wait for it to grow but with today's spike, I couldn't help but sell.

Next play is AMZN. Too risky for calls for me so I bought 20 shares. Currently -400+ from ATH and earnings on February. Probably going to see run up soon.

817,2021-01-12,"I jumped in with 600 on rh.. all in royal Carib at 20 a share, next day it was 40. Cashed out and did the same with other industry‚Äôs.. made 3500. 

Saw someone playing options .. I was like wtf are options? I googled it... sounded like a crazy way to make even more... so fk it why not, uhm I think this stock should go up.. (I thought I had to wait for expiry) to my crazy convenience that worked. Quite a few times. I said ok what‚Äôs a put? Let me try. I lost, ah ok so that‚Äôs what a put is. Let‚Äôs try a few more: ‚Äî-&gt; fast forward 2 months im at 15k. Wow I‚Äôm pretty good at this, what‚Äôs this iron condor shit? Wake up, -5k few hours later -15k... holy fk what‚Äôs going on?! I emailed the to exercise the others and I came out of the -15k with +400...   Ok so no more iron condors for me. I threw away my soiled shorts and went back and found out what a PDT was. Lol. Ok, I‚Äôm addicted now obv. I‚Äôm a med school student and disabled vet; I need moneys lol. Went to E*TRADE cycle repeats, before prime day I bought way otm contract for $8.. prime day hits and by 12-2pm it‚Äôs gone from 40- (sold at 56 weak hands yes I know) to 70 for that contract. Fk why didn‚Äôt i buy moar!!??

Fast forward, paid bills got another PDT, found Webull. Balls too big to walk with I lost it all (except 200) found a way to ride calls and puts at various prices on same stocks etc, back to 3500.. now things get fun.

With I bounced back and forth between 800-3k so my hands got a little weaker and balls a little
Smaller... take profits, but still the issue of I‚Äôm not selling at negative 40% ride or die... (worked but usually didn‚Äôt) one example 545% return on. Aapl call that netted me $60 lol. Or 2700% on BlackBerry that net me 980.

Now the real cringe.. so as I sat there wondering man I wonder how many calls/puts I played if only stuck to my guns would I have made? (I looked no further than December... shudder) 
10x Tsla 740calls for Jan 15/21 bought at .16 sold for 2.  
4 tsla 900 calls Jan 15/21 bought for 2.15 sold 2.74
20x SPY 372 puts (can‚Äôt remember exact date but I have screen shots somewhere in all these memes) bought during uptrend when spy hit 380‚Äôand dumped to 360 (should‚Äôve been like 20+k)
From what i do know, the tsla 740‚Äôs would have sold for 144-145 each and the 900‚Äôs i think wanna say $8-9$?  So y‚Äôall can do the math it makes me sick lmao

Hope you all

Just look up who holds GME. The idea that only retail Investors held GME was always a lie. We were always a minority in the overall float. Once the major players decided to teach retail gamblers a lesson there was no turning back. 

There will be a rebound but I wouldn‚Äôt chase it. This is on a terminal spiral from here on out. Instead of occasional dips you‚Äôre really seeing occasional spikes - don‚Äôt buy the spikes or believe the spikes mean a comeback. 

Buy AAPL or some real long term stocks if you still have funds after this - don‚Äôt invest in sticking it to the hedge funds because the hedge funds also own large long positions. I can‚Äôt believe nobody looked this up or realized it.

BB is one of these stocks - there is some good substance here - Analysts value the stock at an average of $8. So that is the base here. I think there is a lot of nice value in BB's future, especially if EV's take off. Further, the fact that you silly gooses are in the stock means that you can buy a buttload of shares and churn covered calls at a profit.

So yea - while I do sell covered calls I maintain roughly 500-1000 shares in any given week. Because I like the Stock and more importantly I like the company.

I was trading in 2008. Any monkey was making money trading stocks. You didn't need to baghold shit, just close your eye, pick a stock, set your limit at 15-20% return and jump into your next play. Turned $2k (every penny I got from an internship) into $14k in a matter of 3 months. That's probably when I should've quit since I could've just kept all my stocks in that portfolio that would be worth somewhere close to $250k at this point (AMD/NVDA/MSFT/AAPL). But instead I got into Penny's and joined pump and dump schemes that mirror EXACTLY what the GME thread looks like right now. Lost everything.

And fuck off with these zoomers who think 2008 was 50 years ago. I was trading on Scottrade @ $7 a trade on my phone (a Sidekick on edge because you don't need that much data to load the Scottrade site).

Summary: Fig 1., Fig 2., and Fig 3. show a cumulative total of 5,661 shares of GME which were traded on 10:57:32, on Feb 2, 2021, over 30 separate trades. Fig 4. showcases 635 shares of AAPL being traded (contained within the highlighted section) over a 1 ms timeframe on 11:05:35, on Feb 2, 2021, over 5 separate trades. Fig 5. showcases 400 shares of AAPL being traded (contained within the highlighted section) over a 1 ms timeframe on 10:57:32, on Feb 2, 2021, over 2 separate trades.

The trade-time shown in Fig 4. was used because that was initially when I opened the NASDAQ real-time trade data for AAPL. I went back and added Fig 5. so that a more appropriate comparison could be made to the trade-time that I used for GME.

### Negative feedback loop

Here's why: Hedge funds that bet against GameStop and other Reddit-favored stocks were forced to take steps to counter their losses. Some faced margin calls, requests to put up more capital when positions weaken. To raise cash, they had to sell completely unrelated but highly liquid stocks such as Apple ([AAPL](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=AAPL&amp;source=story_quote_link)) and Amazon ([AMZN](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=AMZN&amp;source=story_quote_link)). And that in turn caused other investors to take chips off the table, continuing the negative feedback loop.

## 2024 Rollout Seen For Apple Car

**Apple** ([**AAPL**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) will invest 4 trillion won ($3.6 billion) to build the Apple car at a Kia facility in Georgia, citing a DongA Ilbo report.

A deal could come Feb. 17 with the electric vehicles launching in 2024, the report added. Initially, Apple and Kia are said to be aiming for 100,000 Apple cars a year.

It might be a good idea to purchase some call options...

Apple Car Rumors Won't Stop. Kia Stock Is Rising. -- Barrons.com

2/3/21, 2:29 PM
Investors are still nervous, obsessed, even hopeful Apple will produce an all-electric, self-driving car.

The latest evidence is Kia Motors (ticker: 000270. Korea) stock. Shares in the South Korean auto maker are up almost 10% after a report in a Korean newspaper that Apple (AAPL) will pick it as its partner for a coming iCar.

The report says Apple will invest $3.6 billion in Kia. Kia's market capitalization is about $36 billion, so that would amount to a 10% stake.",touchhimwiththejab,wallstreetbets,149.0

33,2021-02-08,"Not defending RH here. I think they're shitty for many other reasons than just limiting GME buy orders. 

But the difference between GME and AAPL is massive, particularly with regard to precisely the reason RH gave for why they limited buy orders - clearinghouse deposit requirements. 

I'm sure you're aware of this already, but just in case you missed it - during the T+2 clearing period, your broker is required to put up a certain amount of the value of the trade, in cash, to ""guarantee"" the trade. For a normal, non-GME levels of volatility stock like AAPL, this deposit requirement is ~1-3% of the trade value. So if you put in a trade to buy $10,000 worth of AAPL, your brokerage has to put up $100-$300 in cash until the trade clears. They can't use your cash to do it, they have to use their own cash for it. 

When the volatility of GME skyrocketed, so too did the deposit requirement. To the point where, when RH (and other brokers) restricted trading, the deposit requirement was 100% of the trade value. So for your $10k buy order of GME, they had to put up $10k of their own cash. But more importantly, they would ALSO be required to put up 100% of the trade value for their customers' SELL orders also. They didn't have the money to pay for both buy &amp; sell orders from their customers, so to prevent getting into a situation where they ran out of deposit $ and couldn't clear ANY orders for their customers, so their customers are trying to sell their GME/other stocks but can't, they restricted buying so they'd have enough money to cover all the sell orders.",Jutilaje,wallstreetbets,33.0

Get some dingdong big investors on board and merge with your company, APPL. How APPL operates is simple. People are becoming dumber at an alarming rate. As this trend increases, so will people accidentally typing in APPL, intending to invest in AAPL. Your ""proprietary"" software will find the perfect balance between stock offerings to dilute the value of the shares issued and buy backs to keep the stockprice the same as AAPL so you ""investors"" never notice what's happening.

By this Summer, or Fall at the latest, we're going to see a global deflationary bust much worse than 2008, and rivaling 1929. We're talking +60% market drop across the board. And it won't recover to current levels for another 5 years after that.

So mark this post.

This IS the Great Melt-Up.  So, you are going to see a wild run up (as if 2020 wasn't wild enough). If you get out now, you could be leaving 15-20% gains on the table.  So, hold?  Well, don't try to time it too tight, because it could pop tomorrow, or some random Monday.  I'd rather leave 10% on the table now, and buy back AAPL or AMZN when they're at 40% of their current price.

I'm slowly unwinding all my positions to cash and silver (gold is fine too), except for very long holds (+10 years) involving too much money that I won't want to take the Cap. Gains hit on.  I'll be all out (except for those) by April, with fists of cash ready to scoop up the rubble.

Stocks that go up that fast can also go down that fast. The market is acting exactly as it should when people are SPECULATING (gambling) on stocks. If you want the market to act normal than put your money in stock of companies that have real revenue that justify their price - AAPL, AMZN, AMD, NVDA, ADBE, CRM etc. When a company like MSFT, ADBE that does BILLIONS in revenue forecasts 20% year over year growth and hits those numbers they justify the valuation.

There‚Äôs always a point the day after earnings where the whales take their 8% profit. Buy that dip. Hold a few days. Sell. Rinse, repeat. And stay out of the market between earnings dates. 

Twitter this week is a prime example. It was just below $60. Earnings came and it hit $68 the next day and dipped back to $64. Now its $70. You‚Äôd have made around 10% buying that dip and holding it for a day or two. 

Do not take my word for it. Find good stocks that YOU like and line up their charts with past earnings dates and see past performance. Do not buy before earnings.

I'm watching these for weed stocks: SNDL, OGI, TLRY, APHA, and two EFTs: MSOS and YOLO. SNDL only fit in because of the 10day push to be over $1. Their FA/TA is trash. It's nothing I want to look at again after whatever movement happens from this 10 day push.

Also looking at MMEDF for psych stocks, following buffets movement into pharma for the first time ever. Anything in pharma is going to pop like the tech bubble, so anything will likely hop to $5 spots... but I want to look into peter thiels' psych med company too, i forget the ticker. I don't have enough TA done in this category to say anything. I just know the psychedelic's part of the pharma market is ready to explode and I'm deciding what horses are primed.

This isn't a huge data set to start working. But I can say with good certainty that these are good picks in these categories. Is there any chance you want to look into these over the weekend?

153,2021-02-12,"Hey man appreciate the straight talk, so I'm gonna open up a little.
I don't agree with you, about that being boomer only advice.
I'm 47.  I've been doing the same strategy as my family has taught me for 30 years...
I could retired this year. 
First time I could say that. 
It's BECAUSE of those buy and holds.
But let me elaborate? 
Buy and hold isn't dickies. 
It isn't 'action' less.
Buy and Hold means, when you find yourself using a new product, a lot, and you love the product, and you go find out it's a public company, you dig deep and you put a fucking STAKE in that product.  You put your money where your mouth is, and you back away. 
Or sometimes, you get that feeling from a BIG COMPANY that does something new.  Like when Facebook bought Occulus - I saw (and still see) exactly what they want to do there, and I was 100% all in. 
And when AAPL misses earnings?  And craters?
It takes giant size balls not to sell. 
And when your friend tells you GME is going to take off, and it starts to, and EVERY DAY it's going higher and higher, and your finger is on the trigger to buy...
But you remember...
You don't buy games at GameStop.  You buy them on Amazon, or on Xbox.  
And the few times you've gone into Gamestop, it's been 'okay', but not great.  Smells a little funny.  
So you have the fucking discipline to sit on your hands and not invest in the trend. 
That takes some character too.
So for all these reasons, I think my family's variation on buy and hold isn't just for Boomers, but for me personally, as a Gen Xer.
Now if you like day trades, and exit strategy, and options.  Fine!  There are plenty of games in the casino.
But when I go the casino?  I walk right past the table games, past the slots... right to the poker room.  That's my game, that's what I know, and there's plenty of money to be made.  

Yes, I should have taken the gains but I was caught unaware, and I WASN'T playing a day-trade, so I was really taken back.  A stop loss would have been a good idea too once it took off.

For example, AAPL pays quarterly dividends and is now paying a dividend $0.205/share this quarter, so if you own 100 AAPL shares on the right date, you would get $20.50.

In this case, RKT announced a special one time only dividend of $1.11 per share, payable to everyone who owns shares at market close on the 9th of Feb. (there‚Äôs some complexity around this, as it takes 2 business days for shares to properly change ownership, so you‚Äôd have to buy in by Friday and hold till after Tuesday to get it.

Of course, since everyone already knows about the dividend coming, it‚Äôs already basically priced into the share price. Once it‚Äôs paid out, you can expect the share price to drop again by a similar amount, though probably more because at this point, it‚Äôs turning into a pump and dump, so you have to plan your exit at the right time.",lachlanhunt,wallstreetbets,22.0

Worst of all, their cost of revenue went WAY up on last earnings.  Future business should be getting cheaper for a mature company like PLTR, they aren‚Äôt a startup.  My last problem with them, too many fan boys who are trading emotionally rather than logically.  PLTR will grow steadily but they will not be busting out to 100B+ anytime soon.

133,2021-03-08,"Regarding PLTR, I'm having a really hard time understanding its current and future evaluation and how this is a good investment. I love what the company is doing, but at its current price point it seems extremely overvalued.

Currently its trading at ~44x P/S for 2020, and based on 4B revenue in 2025, that would pin them at ~12.5x P/S for 2025. I understand they have a high profit margin, but even taking that into account the valuation still makes no sense. Assume they achieve a net profit margin of 50% (frankly, insane), that would be earnings of 2B on 4B revenue in 2025, or a P/E of 22x. Assuming you were looking for the stock to double by 2025, that would further peg them at 44x P/E. None of the FAANG companies have ever traded higher than 20x P/S in their entirety, and they are arguably the highest growth stocks ever. FAANG P/E ratios are all over the place based on profit margins, but AAPL being the highest of the bunch never traded above 35x, and that was before the 08 crash.

Just looking for some opinions on this and what I might be missing, but the financial valuations of PLTR look to be extremely disconnected to its future prospects.",Entrepreneur-first,wallstreetbets,133.0

166,2021-03-08,"I follow aapl a lot which is why it's my largest holding and it's a long term one which is why I have shares. Historically aapl actually barely moves on product announcements alone. If you look at it's movements after product events over time, the only one which has produced a statistically significant average move is WWDC which is in June. If a new buyback announcement comes that would be great and could potentially reverse the direction its going in but it's hard to estimate if such an announcement would occur and how big it would be.

AAPL is a great company no doubt and it's earnings were great but even though its market cap has increased 40% since pre covid, it's revenues and earnings have not increased that much. That increase is a product of economic environment where low interest rates and lack of growth anywhere else made tech the best place to put money over the last year. As a result the tech P/E ratios are highest they've ever been. Things are changing so even though AAPL has increased revenue and earnings a decent amount, if we go back to its pre covid P/E levels it should be priced around 85.33. ([https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/pe-ratio](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/pe-ratio))

Basically aapl along with other big tech names are kinda fucked short term as they drift towards lower P/E ratios. I'm speculating here but I don't think it'll be a full on crash because they are good companies and people will be buying to average down throughout the drop (like we saw last friday and last monday), but nonetheless it'll be a slow bleed. I'm not selling a single share cuz I've held these for years but I also had AAPL calls a little while ago and I'm very glad I sold them for a huge loss while I still could because they would've expired worthless otherwise",steakandp1e,wallstreetbets,166.0

226,2021-03-08,"March 8 (Reuters) - The Dow climbed on Monday, led by stocks poised to benefit the most from an economic rebound as the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill awaited a final Congressional vote this week, and heavyweight tech-related stocks swung between gains and losses.

After the legislation won U.S. Senate approval on Saturday, President Joe Biden said he hoped for a quick passage of the revised coronavirus relief package by the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives so he could sign it and send $1,400 direct payments to Americans.

Prospects of more government spending and faster economic growth have stoked fears of a spike in inflation, sending the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield to near one-year highs.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, however, said on Monday the package would fuel a ""very strong"" U.S. recovery and she did not expect the economy to run too hot because of the increased spending.

The Dow hit a new record intraday high and was trading above its Feb. 24 record close. In the S&amp;P 500, the financial sector was the biggest boost, hitting a record as higher interest rates and a steeper yield curve helped banks. Industrials were right behind, also reaching a record high, while the materials sector neared an all-time peak. The technology sector was deepest in the red.

""This is an ideal traders' market with certain sectors and individual stocks performing better than the wider market, as investors pick and choose individual stocks that will perform better as the economy reopens,"" said Anthony Denier, chief executive officer of trading platform Webull.

A slide in the big tech stocks that have driven the rally in equities since pandemic-induced lows of last March continued, with Apple Inc(AAPL), Nvidia Corp(NVDA), Tesla Inc(TSLA) and Alphabet Inc's(GOOG) Google leading declining shares on Nasdaq.

Tech stocks are particularly sensitive to rising yields because their value rests heavily on earnings in the future, which are discounted more deeply when bond returns go up.

The divergence between the tech stocks and non-tech stocks explains trading today, said Joe Saluzzi, partner and co-founder of Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.

""The stimulus package will be certainly helping the bigger cap names,"" Saluzzi said, referring to non-tech stocks. ""The get-out and non-stay at home stocks are doing better now,"" he said.

By 3:09 p.m. ET (2009 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 416.64 points, or 1.32%, to 31,912.94, the S&amp;P 500 lost 3.83 points, or 0.10%, to 3,838.11 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 259.71 points, or 2.01%, to 12,660.44.

Banks added about 1.7% as the yield on the benchmark 10-year note stood near a 13-month high, while airlines jumped about 5%.

Walt Disney Co (DIS) jumped about 5.8% as California health officials set new rules that would allow Disneyland and other theme parks, stadiums and outdoor entertainment venues to reopen as early as April 1.

GameStop Corp (GME) surged about 33% after the company said it had tapped shareholder Ryan Cohen to lead a transition to an e-commerce business.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.68-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.28-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&amp;P 500 posted 124 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 390 new highs and 21 new lows.

The company is known for three projects in particular: Palantir Gotham, Palantir Metropolis, and Palantir Foundry. Palantir Gotham is used by counter-terrorism analysts at offices in the United States Intelligence Community (USIC) and United States Department of Defense.[6] In the past, Gotham was used by fraud investigators at the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, a former US federal agency which operated from 2009 to 2015. Gotham was also used by cyber analysts at Information Warfare Monitor, a Canadian public-private venture which operated from 2003 to 2012. Palantir Metropolis is used by hedge funds, banks, and financial services firms.[7][8] Palantir Foundry is used by corporate clients such as Morgan Stanley, Merck KGaA, Airbus, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.[9]",yy1500,wallstreetbets,277.0

Tech isn't the place to be when the market is fearing inflation and there's a sector rotation into reopening / value stocks. The simplest way to put it is that tech companies do not represent as much growth anymore relative to the rest of the market because commodities, travel, leisure, and energy are going to grow faster in the coming months. If they don't represent as much relative growth for the near term, their share prices will go down. Look at 2016 and 2018. All these great tech companies were still great then, but the environment was changing with different interest rates and that didn't stop these tech companies from dropping 20%+.

What? You must be new to investing if that's what you think , share price reflect the future value and potential to create more value of a company generally not the other way around  and aapl was trading at a huge discount.
Also stock barely trade at a fair value , they are mostly trading under or over the actual value.

I can't believe what I'm reading.  There are a billion factored into Share price,  if it was a simple oh this company makes this much so this is how much it worth  there wouldn't be hundreds of thousands of analysts getting paid 6 figure to analyze a company to the bone.

Both aapl and pltr are over value but if you had to compare aapl vs pltr only , aapl looks fking cheap AF .

Aapl is trading at 32 p.e and forward p.e  of high 20s

What's the forward p.e for pltr ?

An undervalue stock has a easier time to double and become overvalued than an overvalued stock to double to become-out-of-this-universe-valued stock regardless of market cap.

485,2021-03-08,"When you short a stock, you borrow shares from your broker. 

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre using fidelity and you want to short one share of AAPL, which is trading at $100. When you click ‚Äúsell short‚Äù fidelity lends you one share of AAPL that they have on hand, which you immediately sell for a $100 profit. Because you‚Äôre borrowing it, you need to give them one AAPL share back at some point, and you pay interest on it in the mean time.

Your goal is to buy it back at a lower price, then give it back. So if you sell short at $100 and then the price of AAPL falls to $50, you buy back that one share of AAPL at $50 and give it to your broker.

$100 up front - $50 to buy back = $50 profit from the share price falling.

The same thing happens the other direction: if AAPL rises to $200 you‚Äôll have to buy back at $200 which will mean you lose $100.

If you short a stock at $20 and it goes up to $200, you lose $180 per share you‚Äôve shorted which adds up to a lot of money. If your broker doesn‚Äôt think you‚Äôll be able to afford buying back when the price goes higher, you get margin called and are required to add funds to your account. If you can‚Äôt do that, you are required to immediately buy back (cover) at the current price so the broker doesn‚Äôt lose all of their shares.",AntiochusIV,wallstreetbets,485.0

There's a low chance that the squeeze squeezes and a handful of shares trade in the 6 figures, but it will get shutdown if that happens. You and I won't be able to cash out at that price. I don't know what mechanism will be used, but at that point it's in ""too big to fail"" territory and trading will just be stopped, trades will be reversed, whatever.  
  
The upper bound I see is the example from the VW squeeze where VW temporarily became the most valuable company in the world on paper. GME passing AAPL would be around a $35k share price.  
  
But I'll keep holding the stock, because when I look at lists of companies with valuations of $40-60B, GME wouldn't seem out of place there, and $1k puts them at the top of that range. Squeeze is just on top of that.",PM_ME_CRYPTOCURRENCY,wallstreetbets,5.0

* GameStop(GME) builds on Monday's 40% surge

* Indexes up: Dow 0.74%, S&amp;P 2.01%, Nasdaq 4.10% (Updates prices, adds analyst comment)

By Herbert Lash and Karen Pierog

March 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks advanced on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq jumping about 4% to recoup its losses from the previous session, as U.S. bond yields retreated and investors scooped up battered technology stocks.

Tesla Inc (TSLA) jumped about 19%, while Apple Inc(AAPL) , Amazon.com Inc(AMZN) and Microsoft Corp(MSFT) gained between 3.3% and 4.4% after sharp losses in recent weeks as a rise in yields raised concerns over their high valuations.

News that a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package was nearing final approval sparked a spike in yields on Monday, pushing the tech-heavy Nasdaq to end more than 10% below its Feb. 12 closing high, confirming a correction for the index.

U.S. 10-year Treasury note yields eased to as low as 1.523% after hovering near 13-month highs of 1.613% in the prior session. Longer-dated yields have jumped over the last month as investors price in a faster-than-expected economic rebound and higher inflation.

The market is adjusting to the new level in interest rates, said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York. Companies whose products and services are in demand when the economy is doing well, known as cyclicals, and small-cap stocks will outperform this year, she said. Tech will end the year higher but not be the leader as it was in the past year's rally.

""Today the 10-year is down a bit, and that takes pressure off valuations, so tech is performing well,"" Hooper said. ""The market is just about getting comfortable at this level of rates.""

Rising interest rates disproportionately hurt high-growth tech companies because they are valued on earnings expected years into the future rather than profits earned in the short term.

""Potential headwind for the market is (when) interest rates rise further from this point over the short period ... since they have risen too fast in too little time,"" said Michael Sheldon, chief investment officer at RDM Financial in Westport, Connecticut.

By 2:50 p.m. ET (1950 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 234.05 points, or 0.74%, to 32,036.49, the S&amp;P 500 gained 76.96 points, or 2.01%, to 3,898.31 and the Nasdaq Composite added 517.57 points, or 4.1%, to 13,126.73.

The rise in Treasury yields has accelerated a rotation from ""stay-at-home"" winners to stocks primed to benefit from an economic reopening, setting the blue-chip Dow on pace to end at a record high on Tuesday.

While the Russell 2000 growth index jumped over 3.2% on Tuesday, compared to a 0.7% rise in Russell 2000 value index , it has sharply underperformed its value counterpart since the start of the month.

Shares of Tesla surged 19% on Tuesday, rebounding from a deep sell-off and putting the automaker on track for its largest one-day gain in nearly eight years.

The global economic outlook has brightened as vaccine rollouts gain speed and the United States launches a massive new stimulus package, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development said, hiking its 2021 growth forecasts.

The Democrat-controlled U.S. House of Representatives will take up the relief bill on Wednesday, with the chamber's expected approval leading to President Joe Biden's signing the legislation into law later this week.

The bank index dropped 0.39% after vaulting to a new 14-year peak. Economy-linked financials, materials and industrials hovered near record highs.

GameStop (GME) was up 22%, building on Monday's rise of over 40% on the video retailer's e-commerce strategy and speculation that small investors will pour stimulus checks into markets.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.31-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.58-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&amp;P 500 posted 37 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 214 new highs and 15 new lows.

140,2021-03-09,"LONDON (Reuters) - Investors are estimated to have made billions of dollars from their bearish bets on Tesla and big tech stocks in the recent knee-jerk selloff triggered by a jump in U.S. Treasury yields, data from financial analytics firm Ortex showed on Tuesday.

Tesla was short-sellers' biggest win, giving them estimated profits of $4.2 billion so far in 2021, followed by more than $1 billion gains each on Zoom Video and Apple(AAPL), according to Ortex.

They were however burnt by betting against videogame maker Gamestop(GME). The company, which was at the heart of the so-called ""stonks"" retail trading mania, has jumped another 400% in the past two weeks as amateur investors have jumped back in.

GameStop's (GME) e-commerce strategy plans were seen driving this week's renewed gains in January's ""meme"" stocks, alongside speculation that small investors will use their upcoming stimulus checks to trade.

In other major bets, investors made about $1 billion from shorting QQQ, an ETF that tracks the performance of the Nasdaq 100. The tech-heavy benchmark hit correction territory on Monday, slipping more than 10% from record highs.

* GameStop(GME) builds on Monday's 40% surge

* Indexes up: Dow 0.53%, S&amp;P 1.49%, Nasdaq 3.17% (Adds comment, details; updates prices)

By Shashank Nayar and Medha Singh

March 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks advanced on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq jumping over 3% to recoup its losses in the previous session as U.S. bond yields retreated and investors picked up battered technology stocks.

Among the biggest boosts to the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq were Tesla Inc(TSLA), Apple Inc(AAPL), Amazon.com Inc(AMZN), Facebook Inc(FB) and Microsoft Corp(MSFT) jumped between 2.4% and 7.2% after sharp losses in recent weeks as a rise in yields raised concerns over their high valuations.

Signs that a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package was closing in on final approval sparked a spike in yields on Monday, pushing the tech-heavy Nasdaq to end more than 10% below its Feb. 12 closing high that confirmed a correction.

U.S. 10-year Treasury bond yields eased to 1.54% after hovering near 13-month highs of 1.613% in the prior session. Longer-dated yields have jumped over the last month as investors price in a faster-than-expected economic rebound and higher inflation.

Higher yields can weigh even more on tech and growth stocks with lofty valuations, as they threaten to erode the value of their longer-term cash flows.

""Tech stocks are overdue for some kind of bounce after the downfall they have had so far with most investor maintaining a positive outlook (on them) in the medium to longer term,"" said Michael Sheldon, chief investment officer at RDM Financial in Westport, Connecticut.

""Potential headwind for the market is if interest rates rise further from this point over the short period... since they have risen too fast in too little time.""

At 9:59 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 168.01 points, or 0.53%, to 31,970.45, the S&amp;P 500 gained 57.06 points, or 1.49%, to 3,878.41 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 399.55 points, or 3.17%, to 13,008.71.

The rise in yields has accelerated a rotation from ""stay-at-home"" winners to stocks primed to benefit from an economic reopening, helping the blue-chip Dow hit an intraday record high on Monday.

The global economic outlook has brightened as vaccine rollouts gain speed and the United States launches a massive new stimulus package, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said, hiking its 2021 growth forecasts.

The U.S. House of Representatives could approve the relief bill as early as Tuesday, with a vote allowing the Democratic president to sign the legislation into law later this week.

The bank index dropped 2% after vaulting to a new 14-year peak. Financials and energy sectors were in the red.

GameStop (GME) was up 18%, building on Monday's rise of over 40% on the video retailer's e-commerce strategy and speculation that small investors will pour stimulus checks into markets.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 3.2-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&amp;P 500 posted 15 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 131 new highs and eight new lows. (Reporting by Shashank Nayar and Medha Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel)",ionized_fallout,wallstreetbets,164.0

210,2021-03-09,""" tesla actually makes close to 25% on each car and that's before fsd""

I thought the number was closer to 20%, but I'm not going to quibble over 5%. Regardless, Toyota promises similar levels of profit per car (around 15-20% range). It's a competitive advantage to be sure, but not enough to justify their valuation so far beyond what their competitors, who have more capacity, more experience and more 

""meanwhile ford is drowning in debt and LOSING money on each mach e""

That's actually not the case, Ford is generating a profit on each Mach-E before RnD costs are taken into account. However, if we take RnD costs into account, they'll be strictly in the black from 2024 onwards. 

""Btw why doesn't anyone mention ford's actual market share, people mention telsas decrease but don't address the fact ford market share is still miniscule""

Going from 0-20% in a month is not miniscule, their production is only just starting and that's a great start. I'm waiting to see what happens when the Japanese muscle into this market though, they've a better history on RnD and efficiency. 

""Here is a riddle, name literally one iconic cisco product. If you name one then I'll know you are a network engineer. Meanwhile aapl has iphone, Iwatch, ipad etc. And tesla had model3 models, especially the model x, and model y, and soon the cybertruck.""

You've got me there, I'm an anthropologist. However, iconic products doesn't always translate to great companies. Cisco's used as an example because they were a great, profitable company that was simply overvalued compared to what it was. Which is what I think Tesla is right now. Once it falls down to 50-100 USD per share, it'll be trading at a fair and reasonable price. I can understand if it's trading within the 100-200 USD range on a serious premium.

240,2021-03-09,"&gt; I didn't realize that to have recent data it cost money

The URL I used was for the price target - not the current price, so it hasn't been updated in some time. If you want the current price, you can check the quote: https://finnhub.io/api/v1/quote?symbol=AAPL&amp;token=sandbox_aaaaaaaaaa which returns the following:

```
{
  ""c"":116.36,
  ""h"":121,
  ""l"":116.21,
  ""o"":120.93,
  ""pc"":121.42,
  ""t"":1615248000
}
```

According to the documentation, `c` is the current price, `h` is the high price (of the day), `l` is the low price (of the day), `o` is the open price, `pc` is the previous close, and `t` is not documented - I assume it's a timestamp.

You can also use websockets or webhooks to get _live_ data, where calling the `/quote/` url is limited by the 60 checks/minute rate limit.

&gt; Also this all looks like it's python ...

The examples I linked are in Python, but the documentation includes a few other versions. They're HTTP ""GET"" requests, so basically it applies to any language. The returned data is in JSON, which is just a string of data formatted a certain way.

You can make HTTP GET requests in C, [here is an example using libcurl](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/https.html).",Hotrian,wallstreetbets,240.0

10,2021-03-11,"Well so for one they're not going to give you max intrinsic value because why the fuck would they accept risk for literally nothing? Because that's what they'd be doing. They would be accepting your call contract and ALSO the potential downside that comes with that e.g. the second that contract changes hands the stock price plummets and now they're holding the bag on your worthless call. So right off they'll never give you 100% intrinsic value until literally expiration. You can see this concept in action in spreads, specifically debit spreads. If you open up a debit spread on, say, AAPL, for $120 to $130, and it IMMEDIATELY moons to $135 or something that puts both your legs immediately itm, you would be at 'max profit' , which would be the strike width, or $1000. But if you actually check out your fully itm spread, they won't be offering you the max profit, or intrinsic value, because there's inherent downside in holding an option, right?  You only get that on expiration. So the actual premium price is going to be partially intrinsic value and then a bit of whatever fucking magical math they do with the greeks to get your extrinsic value. You can even see with DEEP itm calls or leaps that it's almost all intrinsic value... but it's not fully. Because you have to give up some gains for someone else to accept your risk.",HydrocodonesForAll,wallstreetbets,10.0
11,2021-03-11,"I disagree with the other responses. I think your in a shitty spot. For AAPL to be 150$ by Sept, that means they'd be a 3 trillion dollar company or 2x the size that Amazon and GOOG are worth today. It would take a huge catalyst for a company to add 1 trillion to a market cap when only a handful of companies on the planet can even tout 1 trillion in value to start with. It's not impossible,  and AAPL trades much less on a multiplier than some of the tech, but that is likely due to the huge cap already and the consensus is that most other tech is overvalued.",moolium,wallstreetbets,11.0

I keep CNBC on in the background most of the day.  I try to pay attention to the Fast Money crowd at noon and 5pm.  After watching the network for...way too long, I've learned personalities.  When certain ones zig when I expect them to zag, that's when their comments become investible.

Guy Adami is great for setting price targets to watch for on dips.

If uber-conservative Karen Finerman says she's taking a new position, especially if she says she just did a deep dive on the company's debt, you don't wait for a dip to follow her in. (Wish I had done this when she bough WW a couple of weeks ago at $25)

Josh Brown is great for names we like here.  Never buy when he's pounding the table, as the boomers spike it for a few minutes to a day.  But his theories are sound when ""he likes the stock"".

Dan Nathan finally got me in to AAPL after I kept missing entry points, nailed the bottom of the last major dip at $116 before it ran to 140.  He's often overly bearish so when he says to buy, I perk up.

Joe Terranova helps me expand the universe of stocks that have momentum coming that I wouldn't otherwise usually consider.

Steve Weiss can be frustrating, but he got me in (and out, and it, and out) of XPO.  I wish I had listened to Farmer Jim Lebanthal on GM 15 points before I did.

* Yields lower after 10-year Treasury note auction

* Indexes up: Dow 1.67%, S&amp;P 0.88%, Nasdaq 0.17% (Adds House vote, comments)

By Karen Pierog and Herbert Lash

March 10 (Reuters) - The S&amp;P 500 rose on Wednesday and the blue-chip Dow hit a record high after tepid consumer prices data for February calmed inflation worries and legislators gave final approval to one of the largest economic stimulus measures in U.S. history.

A rotation into sectors such as energy and financials continued, both in small- and large-cap stocks, as investors bet on consumer spending when the U.S. economy reopens and sold the big tech names that have fueled the rally since last March.

Accelerated coronavirus vaccine rollouts and a monster fiscal stimulus on the horizon have raised bets on higher inflation, triggering a spike in Treasury yields that pushed the Nasdaq down as much as 12% from its Feb. 12 record close.

Meanwhile, Wednesday's $38 billion 10-year Treasury note auction, which was met with modest demand, pushed the benchmark yield to a session low of 1.506%.

The ""market seemed nonplussed and Treasuries rallied but that didn't seem to give a boost to tech (stocks),"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.

Rising yields had weighed on technology shares that rely on cheap funding for growth.

The U.S. Labor Department released data that indicated the core consumer prices index, which excludes volatile items such as food and energy, rose less than expected last month.

Investors are shifting funds from tech stocks with lofty valuations to other groups, such as energy and financials, that are undervalued and more of a play on an improving economy in a post-COVID world than big tech is, said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.

""It is occurring in fits and starts,"" Tuz said. ""That is essentially the overwhelming theme in the market right now and it probably will continue until these things run their course.""

The move away from Apple Inc(AAPL), Amazon.com Inc(AMZN) , Facebook(FB), Tesla and Microsoft Corp , all down on the day, included a rotation into small-cap stocks, which rose 2.0%, or double the gains of the S&amp;P 500.

Also helping lift stocks are analysts who have raised their estimates for U.S. corporate profitability this year following surprisingly strong fourth-quarter earnings and growing optimism about an economic rebound.

By 2:41 p.m. ET (1941 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 531.85 points, or 1.67%, to 32,364.59, the S&amp;P 500 gained 33.96 points, or 0.88%, to 3,909.4 and the Nasdaq Composite added 22.29 points, or 0.17%, to 13,096.11.

The Nasdaq extended gains in choppy trade after logging its best one-day percentage jump in four months on Tuesday.

The sweeping $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives gave President Joe Biden his first major victory in office.

Some of the $1,400 in payments heading to most Americans could end up in the stock market and could provide a boost for GameStop(GME) and other stocks popular among retail investors active in online social media forums.

Trading in GameStop(GME) was volatile with the stock at times poised to set the videogame retailer on track for its longest streak of daily gains in six months and extending a rally that has already doubled the company's market value.

Among other ""meme"" stocks, Koss Corp(KOSS) climbed 49%.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.86-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.67-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&amp;P 500 posted 47 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 283 new highs and 19 new lows.

* GameStop(GME) set for longest winning streak in six months

* Futures up: Dow 0.55%, S&amp;P 0.40%, Nasdaq 0.59% (Adds comment, details; updates prices)

By Medha Singh and Shashank Nayar

March 10 (Reuters) - Major U.S. stock indexes were set to open higher on Wednesday after data showed underlying consumer prices remained tepid in February, easing concerns about a spike in inflation as an economic recovery gathers momentum.

The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield ticked lower as data showed core consumer prices index inflation rose less than expected as demand for services including airline travel gradually picked up.

Focus is on an auction of U.S. 10-year and 30-year debt later in the day for clues to where yields in the recently volatile market may be headed.

""Expectations for near-term inflation to rise is going to remain due to the huge public borrowings, but the tame inflation data that has come today would definitely drive some optimism among investors,"" said Arthur Weise, chief investment officer at Kingsland Growth Advisors in New York.

At 8:52 a.m. ET, Dow E-minis were up 176 points, or 0.55%, S&amp;P 500 E-minis were up 15.5 points, or 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 E-minis were up 75.5 points, or 0.59%.

Accelerated vaccine rollouts and a new hefty round of fiscal stimulus on the horizon have raised bets on higher inflation, triggering a sharp rise in Treasury yields that knocked off the tech-heavy Nasdaq about 7% from its Feb. 12 record closing high. The Nasdaq logged its best one-day percentage jump in four months on Tuesday, helped by a near 20% jump in Tesla Inc's(TSLA) shares as investors picked up momentum stocks that had recently taken a beating due to higher yields.

Apple Inc (AAPL), Amazon.com Inc(AMZN) and Microsoft Corp(MSFT) extended gains slightly from the previous session, while economy-linked industrial and bank stocks including Boeing Co(BA), Morgan Stanley(MS) and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co(JPM) also added between 0.8% and 1.2%.

The chunk of a $1.9 trillion relief aid, which is on track to be signed into law later this week, is poised to end up in the stock market and could provide a boost for GameStop(GME) and other stocks popular among retail investors active in online social media forums.

Shares of GameStop(GME) jumped another 12%, setting the videogame retailer on track for its longest streak of daily gains in six months and extending a rally that has already doubled the company's market value.

Among other ""meme"" stocks, Koss Corp(KOSS) and AMC Entertainment(AMC) climbed 44% and 7.4%. (Reporting by Medha Singh and Shashank Nayar in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel)",ionized_fallout,wallstreetbets,316.0

Other wallstreetbets Reddit stocks were mixed. AMC (AMC) followed suit trading up 7%, and Blackberry (BB) was up 2%, while Nokia(NOK) was up 2% and Palantir(PLTR) was inching toward 1% up early Wednesday.

Half because you could do really amazing stuff by working on everything that is around your product, but when you totally forgot that you are making computer and phones, starts sabotaging own phones for profit, triple the normal price of the PCs and starts making weird cars instead of making your literal shit-product better instead of just copying the others when the others were supposed to copy you...

You scale into AAPL and when it goes against you (like the recent selloff), you buy another 100 and so on as it keeps getting lower.  You start to slowly sell those shares as the stock runs up until you reach back to your 100 shares.    

If the stock moves against you for too long then you need to reevaluate why you made the trade.  It might make sense to bail out.

Taking some off the table to keep aside is what you need to do if you are a trader.  Another selloff will come.  It is only a matter of time.

The top-weighted technology sector (+1.9%) is the best performer in the early going while four other groups also show gains of 1.0% or more.

Key factors driving today's performance include:

* Leadership from high-beta chipmakers. The PHLX Semiconductor Index (+3.3%) has returned into positive territory for the week thanks to gains in all 30 components. The group is now up 1.9% for the week versus a 3.2% week-to-date gain in the Nasdaq (+2.0%). *South China Morning Post* reported overnight that the U.S. and China established a working group aimed at ""easing export controls"" and ""improving supply chain security.""
* Strong showing from the largest components by weight. **Apple** (**AAPL** 122.05, +2.07, +1.7%), **Microsoft** (**MSFT** 236.54, +4.12, +1.8%), and **Visa** (**V** 226.79, +3.62, +1.6%) are all up more than 1.0%.

**Notable movers:**

* **Qorvo** (**QRVO** 175.15, +9.78, +5.9%): best performer in the sector, rallying back above its 50-day moving average (174.20).
* **ServiceNow** (**NOW** 498.88, +24.88, +5.3%): reclaiming its 200-day moving average (485.36).
* **Skyworks** (**SWKS** 174.48, +6.82, +4.1%): rising back above its 50-day moving average (171.42).
* **AMD** (**AMD** 79.96, +2.44, +3.2%): rising back above its 200-day moving average (78.77).
* **NVIDIA** (**NVDA** 515.88, +17.15, +3.4%): trading near yesterday's high.
* **PayPal** (**PYPL** 250.78, +8.71, +3.6%): rising toward its 50-day moving average (254.04).
* **Fortinet** (**FTNT** 185.41, +4.95, +2.7%): rallying to a fresh record high.
* **Broadcom** (**AVGO** 451.78, +14.19, +3.2%): rising toward its 50-day moving average (458.99).
* **Visa** (**V** 226.79, +3.62, +1.6%): rallying to a fresh record.
* **Apple** (**AAPL** 122.05, +2.07, +1.7%): rising to a one-week high.
* **Oracle** (**ORCL** 66.81, -5.31, -7.4%): weakest performer in the sector despite beating Q3 expectations, issuing above-consensus guidance for Q4, and raising its dividend.",Moral_Insanity,wallstreetbets,184.0

This will be no easy feat and the transition will experience hiccups as is typical with a transition of this magnitude. However our confidence has never been higher, in large part due to the creation of our new team and news vision. With such diversity of thought and an eagerness to shake the status quo, better days are only ahead for Gamestop

2.	Gaming Development
3.	Artificial Intelligence

Gme is a bit riskier.

Some I know, even up until about 2015/16, until they bought in themselves having seen some profits from people that bought in 2010.  Some work people I know, brokers for big international companies, were constantly saying to sell Apple, that it was going down and just in a bubble.   Two stock splits later.  

I only trust my own vibe.  Having watched the online gaming tournaments up until at its highest, before the gambling came in, the future of gaming was strong.  1,000,000 people tuning into a CSGO match at Cobblestone, hoping for a souvenir drop of a case, going through the times of seeing company sponsorship advertised on the maps, seeing the companies that sponsored events.  Everything was going great up until the streamers fucked it with the illegal gambling sites.  

I can see everything getting back to the way it was, back when e-gaming was starting to be accepted as a legit sport, being screened in some Wild Wings place in the US all over as a partnership etc, huge companies like Red Bull sponsoring teams.  

The future is very bright for eSports.  If Gamestop are anywhere involved, and the scene is kept clean and healed from the gambling shit,  there's a great future.

‚ÄúStrategic Alliance between ASE and TSMC
ASE is based in Taiwan, one of the leading centers for outsourced semiconductor and electronics manufacturing in the world. Its close geographical proximity allows the company to benefit from strong manufacturing activity. It has maintained a strategic alliance with TSMC since 1997, the largest dedicated foundry with a market share of 56% of the foundry market revenues. The alliance has made ASE the preferred provider of packaging and testing services for TSMC clients. This allows ASE to benefit by leveraging TSMC's clients of leading companies including Apple (AAPL), Qualcomm, Nvidia (NVDA), MediaTek (OTCPK:MDTKF), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) as clients who account for nearly half of ASE's revenues. Apple, Qualcomm and MediaTek are major players in the smartphone processor market and are developing 5G chipsets that require advanced packaging capabilities which ASE can provide. Given the long-standing relationship between TSMC and ASE, we expect the alliance between both companies to continue as it enables them to provide a total semiconductor manufacturing solution and the close geographic advantage between both market leaders. This means that ASE should be able to continue counting on TSMC's clients of leading chipmakers.‚Äù",Common-Worldliness-3,wallstreetbets,13.0

But the short of it is that a stock is a portion of a company that is worth a certain value based (theoretically) on that companies fundamentals. The better a company performs or its future outlook, the more likely the price of that stock is to rise. The flip side is true and the worse (theoretically) a company performs the more likely the stock is to drop.  

A companies value on the stock market is the number of shares x the current trading price. A company like Apple (ticker $AAPL) is a $2.06 trillion with 16.79 billion shares available, which puts the price of a single share of Apple at $123. Check the stock value and look https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL?p=AAPL it costs $123 to buy one share.   

So all though a company may have a much higher market value, its number of shares available for trade could be less so it trades at a higher price.   

This is why some companies like Tesla ($TSLA) which is a $635 billion company trades at a stock price of (currently) $658 as they only have a total stock outstanding of 959.85 million.   

This is basic supply and demand.   

Buying a share is a Long position because you're usually buying it now expecting it to increase at a later date.   

Some companies pay dividends which is a payment to you from the company for a certain percentage specified by the company as a reward for investing in them. Your money makes you money but its return is smaller than your initial investment to get those shares in the first place.

OP is right on the fundamentals. What is less well known, and perhaps ultimately more valuable, is that it is one of the few platforms for creating VR content. Now VR isn‚Äôt a huge market now because headsets are awkward and expensive. 
But wait, who else is jumping on the VR bandwagon soon? 

Oh yeah, just AAPL. And word is their headset won‚Äôt suck and is coming out this year or next, with technology previews probably at the June dev conference. Also, they have been stockpiling patents in this area lately.

But wait, how will you make content for Apple‚Äôs headset? Well, Apple could buy an established player...or develop their own tool. 

So how does Apple usually roll when faced with these challenges? Hmm...Logic (acquisition), Final Cut (acquisition). Wait, what about Aperture - they made that in-house right?? Yes, and it was a performance laggard that was dumped after a decade of garnering 1 star reviews on Apple‚Äôs own store.

Luckily, I‚Äôve been DD‚Äôing the fuck out of this stock, and can tell you that the timing of this article is more than troubling

MVIS is on a verge of a breakthrough announcement in not one, not two, but three different verticals:
1. LiDAR + EV cooperation with either MSFT/AAPL/or WVAGY
2. Giant, and I mean giant, patent moat that they are sitting on, as it‚Äôs gaining value, in billions (think Motorola being bought by Google for their patent moat)
3. The $22 billion dollar (just the initial leg of this contract, probably hundreds of billions when all said and done, once other branches and UN follows suit, like they‚Äôve done in the past) with MSFT for the IVAS (augmented reality unmanned drone control goggles, or simply - remote digits vision goggles)

The last point happened just two days ago, and will be officially confirmed only next week, while the other 2 points are having announcements in Mid April.

So why a hit piece based on ‚Äúhistorical averages‚Äù? Why now?

This is a 5x bagger if you play straight stocks, and possible breakout 500x bagger if you know what you are doing with debit call spreads.

Price now is $15
Price target is $75 (with buyout announcement possibly taking it to $150-$200)

Then I saw a related post on BLNK that it was one of the worst stocks to be in right now because it is so overvalued and won‚Äôt be profitable for 3 years so I sold at a 1% loss. Since then it is up about $8/sh and I looked back and the article I read was written by someone who has puts on the stock. I reinvested it on FUBO because it was a top buy pick by an investment company I pay for advice from and the same day it was down 20% so I guess I‚Äôm holding that for a while.

167,2021-04-05,"**TL;DR:** TSLA short interest is not 5% as reported, but 26% due to float contraction &amp; options bets, making the stock susceptible to a short squeeze.

DD:

----

- The 5.5% TSLA equity short interest of 44m shares [1] is only part of the ""true"", effective TSLA short interest: there's 2.6 million put option contracts open right now [2], a significant part of which are in the money, which, on a ~20% rally due to record Q1 results, combined with 2.6 million open calls, have the delta hedging effect equivalent to another ~100m shares short covered ...
- The pro-forma float of TSLA is 771m shares [2] - but at least ~130m of that is locked up by S&amp;P 500 index funds, ~90m by options market makers for current delta hedging requirements: 220m shares or 28% of the float is already locked up today - effective float is 551m shares or lower.
- Due to TSLA's +1,000% rally in 2020 options market makers are net long TSLA by tens of millions of shares - so the delta hedging effect of put contracts doesn't show up in the regular short interest as it normally does for other names. Much of the effective short interest is ""hidden"" by this temporary artifact.
- So if we plug these numbers in: with TSLA starting at $661 if we have a major rally due to the Q1 results (TSLA already up +7% today) then we have 44m shares equity short and market makers lock up another ~100m shares during the rally just to delta-hedge the millions of puts and millions of calls.
- The delta hedging by market makers is anti-dilutive, just like short covering: it removes shares from the effective float. Anti-dilutive buy-to-cover is much stronger buying pressure than the typical trader-to-trader buying, because it contracts the float. 
- So should most Tesla shorts want to cover (not all: some are price insensitive hedges), they have to compete with the delta hedging of market makers (and regular bullish buyers): there's a combined buying of 144m shares on a 20% move, against an effective float of 551m shares. **That's an effective short interest of 26%.**
- A short interest of 26% for a low-float megacap like TSLA is excessively high compared to other megacaps: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT and GOOG short interest is all below 1%, and their options open interests are an order of magnitude smaller than that of TSLA. [4]  [5]


I.e. the Tesla shorting that drive the price down from the $900 ATH to the current $661 is an ***excessively*** overcrowded short trade, with over $30b value at risk - which they'd want to cover much faster than any GME short position.

So a significant TSLA ""synthetic short squeeze"" is possible IMO, driven in part by excessive short options bets.

Should after the record quarter TSLA rally beyond $900 price levels to new ATHs, then all bets are off.

But at the end of the day this is wsb, so throw some tuition money into AAPL calls and use that as your opportunity in America!",Toomuchfree-time,wallstreetbets,11.0

138,2021-04-08,AAPL 133c expiring tomorrow yolo. 0.07 each. If Apple has a random 3% pop tomorrow that‚Äôs 1000% gains. Considering Apple ATH is 143 this isn‚Äôt even an absurd scenario.,isospeedrix,wallstreetbets,138.0
139,2021-04-08,"&gt;Last question lol does the premium on the sold call go to you right away once someone buys it like it‚Äôs yours to keep.

It's yours, but it's just offsetting the long call you bought when you sold the short call. It's more like reducing the debit for the position than selling premium for profit. 

&gt;So if tomorrow morning your sold call is at 131 are you going to close your long call? I know most people don‚Äôt exercise but still lol. And do you always do the same strike price like if you bought a 5/21 132 strike you‚Äôd sell a 132 4/16 strike?

I personally wouldn't let a calendar run ITM if I could help it at all. You'll start losing gains as it crosses your strike. If AAPL hadn't hit 130 today I would have closed at anything greater than 128.50 EOD just to account for after hours/premarket moves tonight and tomorrow. 

Calendar vs diagonal. Calendar is same strike, diagonal is different strikes. I'm not wrinkled enough to tell you when to use each. I would wager the diagonal implies higher directional conviction.",PussySmith,wallstreetbets,139.0

If it hits and everyone who owns gme becomes a millionaire, the economy would collapse. Money wouldn‚Äôt mean anything.

The economy isnt going to collapse is GME hits a 1T marketcap or even a 3T to beat AAPL for a day or whatever. lmao the fuck are you talking about stupid? This is embarrassing 

&gt;And not to mention the US government will 110% step in way before a squeeze ever happens (not that it ever would happen).

Why would the US government step in to destroy the US economy? hhahah 

&gt;Robinhood stepped in last time at like $400. And yet you guys really think this time will be any different? 

Honestly, the best part of this is now you trying to convince me the market is rigged and they will never lose. So what do you invest in exactly? Some magical free market?

&gt; Gme MIGHT hit $400 again one day if some whales feel like pushing it. But there‚Äôs no short squeeze. And even if there was it‚Äôd be shut down. You‚Äôre naive if you believe differently.

Even without a squeeze GME will be 800-1200 in 2 years or so organically. 

&gt;‚ÄúOh the system is so corruptttttt. But they totally will let us all make millions from this! They won‚Äôt be corrupt this time!‚Äù

25,2021-05-03,"I think you have confused some numbers here. Specifically, when you see ""cost of revenue,"" that does **not** include ""mitigating losses and covering for overhead costs."" It means the cost just of the items that produced the revenue, nothing else.

For 2020, MVIS had total revenue 3.1m, with a cost of 1.4m and thus a gross profit of 1.7m. The ""overhead,"" however, was 15.8m (split as $5.9m general and 9.8m R&amp;D). 

Combine those together and you get gross profit 1.7m *minus* operating expenses of 15.8m for an operating income of -14.1m.

NOK's operating income in 2020 was 2,060.8m. By these measures, NOK blows MVIS out of the water.

Truth is, this isn't a good way to value MVIS anyway. If you are buying MVIS, you are absolutely, totally, completely not buying it based on its current financials. It is not a ""value"" stock, it is a ""growth"" stock.

Usually, when looking at growth stocks, you start with the revenue. You want to see rapid growth of revenue or at least the potential for it.

Over the past five years, MVIS has had revenue per share of $0.28, $0.13, $0.20, $0.08, and	$0.02. This is not inherently a problem, but it is when the stock is trading at $13.86. Pick any number you want from those prior years, this is still a multiple over 50. For the most recent year, it's well above 500.

For comparison, TSLA had a revenue per share of $33.80 last year, and it trades at $684.90. A multiple of 20. (That's high, and more a ""growth"" valuation than a ""value"" one. NOK, for example, has a multiple right around 1. AAPL is around 8. AMZN is around 4.) Still far below MVIS.

Truth is, MVIS already has ""growth"" priced into it. Lots and lots of growth. Like &gt;100% compounded annual growth of revenue. That's a problem for anyone buying now.",StoicKerfuffle,wallstreetbets,25.0

49,2021-05-03,"Well so that's the beauty. Don't get caught in the FOMO, unless you like that sort of torture. Just know there will ALWAYS be a good time to buy, and take some of your profits on the way so you can use those funds for pet investments and YOLO trades. Don't sell all, just sell some and only when you need to or only when it will be used for a bigger possible payoff somewhere else and the odds are truly in your favor. Reinvest when appropriate. Comparing the stock now to where it started will always make you feel like you missed the train. Instead, look at it in context. Is now a good time this year? Does it look attractively priced compared to where it could reasonably go? Do you have some tidbit of info that others haven't taken notice of yet? If so, then go for it. If you would prefer it at a different price and that price is within the expected range of volatility, set it to buy at that price and move along to focus on something else in the meantime. But there really is no time like the present for companies like AAPL. World stopping pandemics don't happen every day, and no one can really predict that sort of thing. I just set YOLO money aside for when those events happen so I can take advantage and buy extremely low on companies like AAPL. Otherwise I just use dollar cost averaging and don't let myself focus on regret or FOMO. 

Ppl always say this isn't a casino, but I apply a couple simple rules for myself at both places, and the only time I lose is when I exceed those limits. 

1. Never use money you can't stand losing. The road to BK is littered with those who had a sure bet, went all in, and lost. If you are limited for resources, put the money in things less risky until you have more room to breathe. For instance, if I gamble at a casino, I start with like $20 (or whatever I am reasonably ok with losing that day). If I lose that, I allow myself another $20. If I lose that I walk. No ifs ands or butts.  I don't even bring more money than that, nor do I bring my credit cards. I make sure I have my apple pay or whatever or a prepaid debit card to use in case of emergency, but can't use that at casinos nor with trading so it keeps my money safe from my idiot impulses. I only gamble when I want to go drinking for free, so for me casinos actually save me money lol. But even so, I set a limit for the day, and I don't exceed that limit. I do the same with trading. Only deposit what I can safely fuck off with, and if I can't fuck off with it, that money goes into boring shit I know it will at least be stable in. Doing this has served me extremely well. 

2. Play on profits- The minute you have your initial investment plus a bit of padding, pull the initial investment money out or protect it accordingly and use the rest of the profits to fuck off with. If I lose that, who cares? It is money invested into the experience and knowledge I gain from it, or the fun I had being stupid with it. Sure I could have walked with more, but why not have a little fun instead? Keeps things interesting. 

3. Don't get greedy - With longterm holds, I just make sure I set a stop loss at a place I will feel ok about getting out w initial investment ‚ûï a little on top...and then just monitor the markets.  Take profits when it would be stupid not to and let the flux slide through my mind because there will always be another uptick and another correction.. I go through my stops and adjust as necessary so I'm not sold out of a position I'm willing to ride out a correction on, but when greed hits on a bull run, I know it's time to get out. At least for a short time. I can always get back in if I didn't fuck myself by going all in with money I can't lose. 

4. Never ever forget that the House Always Wins. My task is to be nimble, move quickly when needed, and minimize my exposure to their fuckery. That's why I trade companies I know a bit about or industries I know, and at casinos I play roulette and poker, never craps and never slot machines. If I do play those games, I refer back to rule 1. Always taking them head on with no advantage means I will never gain because my losses will be too great at some point and then I can't keep playing. When working with limited resources compared to the opponent, you need to press every small advantage and minimize weak points. Like Ali said ""Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee"". Know the system you are working within and utilize womp-rat sized holes whenever you find them. Even your odds of good outcomes by only playing games with a high enough payout with money you can stand to lose (especially if it is high risk) and where you have an advantage, even if it is a small one. But then refer to rules 2 and 3 when you seem to be on a streak. 

5. Remember! What goes up, must come down. It may not drop to where it started, but there is always a correction coming. If I have followed my rules, that correction either won't actually touch me, or I've made enough good moves to have a buffer for when it hits and am positioned to take advantage of the downturn rather than getting fucked in the ass w out lube by it. 

I'm up on both gambling and my trades even though I have taken losses at both at times. No one can perfectly time markets or casinos, but knowing the system and having MY system helps. Over the whole scope I am up. These rules keep me in financially safe zones and allow me freedom to let my smooth brained retard side out to play too ü§™ü§ëüòÜ",GypsyGoddessx,wallstreetbets,49.0

We're at all time highs, but that's the point, it's clearly a ceiling blocking prices in and even what amazon and google and apple is doing isn't impressive enough to raise their prices. Something else is overshadowing their fundamentals.

Things are getting tougher for electric-vehicle start-ups. Stock prices have come down. One analyst sees more downside because competition in the EV space is ramping up. 

Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney downgraded Fisker (ticker: FSR) stock to Sell from Hold. His price target goes to $10 a share from $15. 

Fisker stock is off 4.42% to $14.48 in Thursday morning trading. 

Fisker stock has had a brutal few weeks. It wasn't that long ago when the shares were trading at almost $32 each, shortly after the company announced plans for a second model to be built by Foxconn. 

Fisker's first vehicle, the Ocean SUV, is being built by Magna International (MGA) and is due in late 2022. 

That timing for Fisker's vehicles isn't optimal for Delaney, and one of the problems he has with the stock. ""We are incrementally concerned about what we believe is the company's late time to market,"" wrote the analyst in a Wednesday report. He sees competition increasing. 

Delaney counts more about a dozen all-electric SUVs that should be available in the U.S. before the Ocean hits the market. What's more, he sees traditional auto makers ramping up their focus on EVs. General Motors (GM), for instance, has committed to launch 30 new all-electric vehicles by 2025. 

That won't be the only source of competition. Big tech might get involved. Apple (AAPL) is reportedly looking to produce an Apple-branded autonomous, electric vehicle. Also, Baidu (BIDU) is partnering with Chinese car maker Geely, and Xiaomi has announced plans to invest $10 billion in EVs. 

It's all too much for Delaney to keep even a Hold rating on Fisker. He also cut his rating on Lordstown Motors (RIDE) to Hold from Buy, and cut the price target to $10 from $21.",Thestockbroker22,wallstreetbets,154.0

98,2021-05-05,"Can you give more info on what exactly you bought?

Two likely explanations are:

1.) Theta decay. If you bought a call expiring friday and it‚Äôs OTM currently then the price declined because the probability of it expiring in the money went down since there‚Äôs less time for the stock to get past that

2.) IV went down. AAPL declined by as much as 4% yesterday. This probably caused a spike in IV. When IV is higher, investors expect the price to make bigger moves which increases the probability of OTM calls expiring ITM since there is a greater chance of the stock spiking upwards making them more valuable. Today AAPL increases by 1.2% so far. As a stock moves up IV goes down. When IV goes down the probability of OTM calls expiring ITM also goes down which decreases their value.

Options have what are called greeks. They are a measure of how different factors (time until expiration,  volatility, movement in the stock price) etc... will affect the option‚Äôs price at that point in time. You need to take all the greeks into account when buying an option. The movement in stock price is just one factor of several that impact the price of an option.",OptionStrangler,wallstreetbets,98.0

0,2021-05-08,"It feels a lot like Feb 2000, when the dot com bubble was about to burst. I was in the thick of it... I was running a startup hoping to IPO, and I had dozens of friends who were paper millionaires with their stock options, and most wound up worthless. I started with $5k in 1998, and by 2000, I had over $200k in my Schwab account. I thought I had cracked the code, and I was feeling pretty invincible.

In Feb 2000, I shorted some tech stocks, then bailed when they kept going up and took my losses. As the bubble started to burst, I put all my money in ""safe"" profitable tech stocks (Cisco, Oracle, Network Solutions and Intel). A month later the bottom fell out. It was a roller coaster ride, with enough ups to make you think it was coming back. My ""safe"" stocks lost a bundle. I rode two companies into the ground, and lost 90% on others. 

Today, Cisco and Oracle are worth less than they were 21 years ago. Despite consistent earnings increases, they never grew into those valuations. (Yes, I wish I had put everything in AAPL, GOOG and AMZN instead).This market feels ""frothy"" (to quote someone smarter than I am). There will always be winners and losers, but when the market loses its collective mind every time someone says ""inflation"" or ""tightening"" it's concerning.

1,2021-05-08,"Just started following you this last week.  I was doing great last week and then got kicked in the teeth on Shop, Zm, Amzn etc.  Down about 23%.

Added some Clne positions will add more next week if it looks like it has found a bottom but down 50% on Sept $12s.

Jumped into Pltr $22C for May 14th and 21st.  Bleeding.  I should have put stoplosses on it but thought it would go up more the next day.  Saw the exit at about 15% gain but let it ride next day. Lesson learned, always stoploss to secure profit, minimize loss. Hoping for a solid Monday or I will have to cut losses.

Already been in Baba for a while running PMCC, going to expand position and be careful of how far otm the CC are in case it runs.

Same with Aapl.

Added some CAT today.  Going to set stoploss on Monday and see if it will run anymore.  Saw that you just exited. Even right now.

Added KMI, seems to be solid.  PMCC on this one because is seems to be a tortoise stock (slow and steady) with good gains already.

On the wrong side with Tsla, TSM, Pton, Twtr (after drop).  Looking to exit about where you want to short it. TSM seems to be a good PMCC stock because it just hangs around $115 to $122.

Planning to add ON Long and some shorts on PCG, Dash, Bynd, Afrm, Cisco, QS next week.

Also saw a comment earlier that ZM is a buy under $300 but I have been bleeding on it the last week just got out yesterday. Looks like it is in a downward trend down.

You know that loan wasn't factoring in risk.  And you know the building they bought was 30-50% cheaper 3 yrs ago.

Supply chain will also be driving up costs too yes, but you don't print 20% of all M2 ever created in 9 months without that entering the market, and then add $3-6tn over the next few years from the Treasury...inflation is real, they just don't want to talk about it.

Except you do- It‚Äôs definitely safer than some other tech companies right now, but even AAPL isn‚Äôt safe right now.

I think as banks continue to tighten up their margin requirements, we begin to see more and more institutional selling of tech and growth until the algos are triggered. Once the algos are triggered, we‚Äôre looking at a whole market crash of 20-40% before the fed gets involved. If it happens too fast, we‚Äôre looking at a 60-90% crash if the fed can‚Äôt act quick enough.

If AAPL or AMZN or DIS drop 10% larger things are happening to the market itself, but VIAC can (obvs) drop 10% on a dime and thus there's a lot more potential to buy puts, and those puts are hedged with short selling.

im pleasantly surprised that aapl manages to continue making money off of people. Simple design innovations like ""new colors"" so that people can ""express"" themselves is so stupid and yet a surefire way to lure in the next generation.

I do have some of the same fears as you.  One thing that amazes me is that every time they report great earnings the stock drops.  I do think the iphone 13 will not be as much of a dud as you are thinking.  They have already reported on big increases in battery capacity as well as I think the entire line up getting the newest modems capable of the faster 5G service.  Plus I read that rumor is all or most of the line will get lidar and up to 1tb storage option whereas the bigger upgrades are usually reserved for the top of the line models.

Compare this to the same quarter at the previous height of the Gamestop business in 2008\~2009, when it had a P/E ratio of **36**. Which is about where tech giants like AAPL and MSFT are standing. 

Gamestop will have to increase their earnings per share by 600% *at the current share price* to be considered reasonably priced again.

If they can't find people selling, they hedge with ""virtual shares"" they create on their books because they have the ability (and permission) to create liquidity.

The recent surge has completely erased from the top posts like The great meme war, Marty Moho, Guh, that fucking legend that Yolo'd his student loans on AAPL calls for 2 weeks prior to split, then lost it all the next week on CGC (forgot his username).  

Not to mention the complete disregard for Rule 8's fine print that states that gain posts should be realized.  Most of these giant gain posts are still ongoing, and I understand it's part of the meme to let it ride, but dude.  ""Check out my profit retards!"" when you're eating drywall because you haven't realized anything for actual profit yet is fucking gay.  And I shouldn't be downvoted for helping these fucks learn the rules.

I miss the old wallstreetbets, where we were all equal, and common, and failures the same.

79,2021-06-09,"Thanks for the comment! 

I guess for background, I‚Äôm 24 and a half, just finished grad school in stats, and I‚Äôm making $65k/year (living with my parents rn but will be moving back to the RTP for work in late July). Before taxes, every two weeks I‚Äôll be making about $2700. Thank god I have no debt (love my parents so much ‚ù§Ô∏è), but my current portfolio is this:

100 shares of CRSP
15 shares of AMC
10 shares of WISH
10 shares of CLOV

The 100 shares of CRSP I really don‚Äôt want to touch. I originally had 50 shares of MSFT at around $245 at its peak (then), sold it all for GME, diamond handed it, and then sold it for a slight loss at $90/share (bought in around $94/share). Used that money to buy CRSP because I felt like an idiot with my GME purchase, thinking it wouldn‚Äôt ever spike again. Also, like an idiot, while I was still living with my parents back home in Ohio, I was still on my lease back in NC and gambled $2500 (about 6 months worth of rent) in the market as well and lost about $1900 leaving me with just south of 2 months worth of rent. 

I‚Äôve learned my lessons for sure, and I‚Äôm happy that I put money into CLOV and WISH yesterday, and I‚Äôm optimistic about AMC, but my goal is 

100 shares of BEAM, 
100 shares of FATE, 
100 shares of NTLA, 
25 shares of NVDA, 
25 shares of TSLA, 
50 shares of AMD, 
50 shares of AAPL, 
50 shares of MSFT, and 
50 shares of AI. 

That said, I really want to get into purchasing calls, I just don‚Äôt really know how to. I use TD Ameritrade and I just want to make sure I‚Äôm doing it right and be super careful. I definitely have opinions about what prices certain stocks will be at by some time point I think, I just don‚Äôt know how to trade calls on those. I also don‚Äôt really know what ‚Äútheta‚Äù is so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not in the options game. I see so many people making big bucks off it though. I don‚Äôt know the math/logistics of how that works but damn, I want my piece.

Feeling down about the direction of the stock lately? Rubbish and here is why. Take note that I have no idea what I'm doing and draw crayon charts in my spare time. Not financial advice!

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at the current state of shares available this puppy is ready to pop off and its just a matter of time regardless if your involved or not.

&amp;#x200B;

There are many times that people predict a massive  short squeeze and people just promote random things like naked short selling but this is not what is going on here.

&amp;#x200B;

Let us begin with the short interest.

&amp;#x200B;

Shares outstanding: 148.28M

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tc4kmuor2j471.png?width=417&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a204002ce04dd1642212eec53dda172e7e4e48a

&amp;#x200B;

[148.28\*0.24 = 35.58M ](https://preview.redd.it/2cpb1uew2j471.png?width=412&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94be5b644b244611024f78b04c1c4092ac91f516)

&amp;#x200B;

Shares short May 28th: 41.27M

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i8rkb6wg3j471.png?width=416&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47667ee19ed85fa4f22ad25f0394cfd60ebc5318

shares outstanding - insider shares = 112.70M

&amp;#x200B;

Normally we would look at this and say welp 112.70M - 41.27M = 71.43M shares floating around and this would be very difficult to force a squeeze on as GME had maybe 50,000 shares available during its last squeeze with the proper adjustments in place.

&amp;#x200B;

However things get very interesting :)

When you look at how many shares are held by institutions the number is 106.25%

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yjw2ov134j471.png?width=293&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47cb4e09df5cd1dc0b9fb20688ba4efd5ce50486

This is obviously highly irregular. Say you look up a regular stock like AAPL, you will find % owned by institutions is 58.69%, AMZN is similar at 59.32%.

&amp;#x200B;

With this said, this implies that 148.28m\*1.0625 = 157.54m shares are owned by institutions ü§™

&amp;#x200B;

We already discovered that there are only 71.43M shares available. This can only mean that there are 86.11M shares that are literally duplicates in some way.

&amp;#x200B;

Investopedia explains that this could be due to a delay in updates:

https://preview.redd.it/tpwqaojk5j471.png?width=389&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a3459037db015ae822d59d6bdd6f65976c88ef1

BUT investopedia also explains that another reason can  be short selling between investors:

https://preview.redd.it/1rjkf9vo5j471.png?width=390&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=869c35c00bae406a644381caa41fc9f587ce2cbb

&amp;#x200B;

They give a good  explaination to follow this up with:

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/ask\/answers\/07\/institutional\_holdings.asp](https://preview.redd.it/t6fkyizv5j471.png?width=398&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d3a792721f7063e9abb3d267fa0f677c809de10)

&amp;#x200B;

The only real question at this point is if this is a data error or if there are legitimatley all these borrowed shares. If we put this in the context of the float it looks even worse because institutional ownership is revealed to really be 148.28m/112.70m = 131.57% of the float!

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since the hedgies got caught with their pants down on GME with what turned out to be 140% of the shares shorted, this could be a telling sign that the same setup actually exists and is being cleverly hidden if you don't do the math on it.

&amp;#x200B;

With all the popularity around CLOV there is absolutely no wonder at all why the stock had such a massive 80% plus spike the other day. The reason is Delta.

&amp;#x200B;

As fellow degenerates purchase everything from FD's to long calls, they are requiring someone on the other end of that contract to purchase the delta in shares. Why? This is called  delta hedging. I'd hate to reduce it to this but its literally in the name of ""hedge fund"".

&amp;#x200B;

Example. Stock xyz has a delta of 0.25 and you want to write a bunch of calls on it because well it cant go tits up. So you end up writing 10 call options. You total delta is 2.50. This translates to around 250 shares (0.25\*10\*100) needing to be bought to cover. This is an algo thing at this point in the stock game and so generally this hedge is just written into the systems.

So our hedgie buys 250 shares, writes their calls and everythings great. Then the nightmare happens that all call writers hate, the stock starts to upswing and swing up sharply. Your delta increases and NOW you HAVE to buy whatever the upswing in delta is. If delta moves to 0.75, to stay delta neutral you must purchase 500 shares (0.75-0.25\*10 call options =500 shares ).

&amp;#x200B;

What we saw when this thing started to take off is delta screaming higher. I know that its around 0.55 right now for the short term options and up to around 0.61 for the leaps.

All in all considering that supposedly 71.43M shares are available, this seems slightly impossible for the stock to have rallied that hard and how is all the volume even possible if everything is not borrowed so heavily?

https://preview.redd.it/mhiffcbf9j471.png?width=1118&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8ac73194aa022959e1d847367209c845c958ddf

&amp;#x200B;

745.60M shares traded hands. Even at the open at $16.60, this equates to $12,376,960,000 in dollars spend and that is being extremley extremely conservative.

So why is the stock down af these past 2 days? Well because someone fell asleep at the wheel and is now trying to avoid another GME and AMC fiasco. Trust me when I say someone on the other side of this stock is having sleepless nights. I'm entirely convinced that there are no shares available at all and data backs me up on this too.

You will notice that from this chart there are only 300,000 shares available. Remeber the delta at 0.55? Well this means 55 shares must be bought for every  contract so if anyone purchases 5,454.54 contracts then there would literally be no shares available.

&amp;#x200B;

If you dont pay attention to anything else in this post, this section is the crux of everything.

&amp;#x200B;

There were only 15,000 shares availbe on June 3rd and on June 2nd the day before, the stock flew up from below 8 to over 9

https://preview.redd.it/ugymy575bj471.png?width=189&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88f0de6930bbabfb2ee55b7671009806fc27f315

The very next day after this the stock came down from a gap up to 10 to about 9 and then BOOM breakout happens that very Monday and Tuesday (even wednesday at open really). They had to put out the fire and this is why the stock came down at all is the shorts trading all these shares between themselves. You'll notice however this is a very expensive endeavor as the fee is 117%. If they do not put this fire out now, this stock is going to cause billions and billions and billions of losses for hedgefunds and they do not want another bust to go down.

Just for a little sprinkle on top, BOA just downgraded the stock today with essentially reasoning that it looks too high ü§® the ol bad news to drive the stock down is going to backfire.

TLDR

CLOV does not have any available shares, every options contract you buy forces hedge funds to purchase 55 more shares. There are at best 300,000 shares available just off the June 3rd low of only 15,000 shares being available and if 5,454.54 contracts (which anyone can do that math that even a small whale could make this occur) are bought there would no more shares from this standpoint either. There is bad news about CLOV all of a sudden and this is no accident at all!

You will notice that from this chart there are only 300,000 shares available. Remeber the delta at 0.55? Well this means 55 shares must be bought for every  contract so if anyone purchases 5,454.54 contracts then there would literally be no shares available.

There were only 15,000 shares availbe on June 3rd and on June 2nd the day before, the stock flew up from below 8 to over 9

The very next day after this the stock came down from a gap up to 10 to about 9 and then BOOM breakout happens that very Monday and Tuesday (even wednesday at open really). They had to put out the fire and this is why the stock came down at all is the shorts trading all these shares between themselves. You'll notice however this is a very expensive endeavor as the fee is 117%. If they do not put this fire out now, this stock is going to cause billions and billions and billions of losses for hedgefunds and they do not want another bust to go down.

Just for a little sprinkle on top, BOA just downgraded the stock today with essentially reasoning that it looks too high ü§® the ol bad news to drive the stock down is going to backfire.

TLDR

CLOV does not have any available shares, every options contract you buy forces hedge funds to purchase 55 more shares. There are at best 300,000 shares available just off the June 3rd low of only 15,000 shares being available and if 5,454.54 contracts (which anyone can do that math that even a small whale could make this occur) are bought there would no more shares from this standpoint either.

Looking at the current state of shares available this puppy is ready to pop off and its just a matter of time regardless if your involved or not.

&amp;#x200B;

There are many times that people predict a massive  short squeeze and people just promote random things like naked short selling but this is not what is going on here.

&amp;#x200B;

Let us begin with the short interest.

&amp;#x200B;

Shares outstanding: 148.28M

Shares short May 28th: 41.27M

shares outstanding - insider shares = 112.70M

&amp;#x200B;

Normally we would look at this and say welp 112.70M - 41.27M = 71.43M shares floating around and this would be very difficult to force a squeeze on as GME had maybe 50,000 shares available during its last squeeze with the proper adjustments in place.

&amp;#x200B;

However things get very interesting :)

When you look at how many shares are held by institutions the number is 106.25%

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yjw2ov134j471.png?width=293&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47cb4e09df5cd1dc0b9fb20688ba4efd5ce50486

This is obviously highly irregular. Say you look up a regular stock like AAPL, you will find % owned by institutions is 58.69%, AMZN is similar at 59.32%.

&amp;#x200B;

With this said, this implies that 148.28m\*1.0625 = 157.54m shares are owned by institutions ü§™

&amp;#x200B;

We already discovered that there are only 71.43M shares available. This can only mean that there are 86.11M shares that are literally duplicates in some way.

&amp;#x200B;

Investopedia explains that this could be due to a delay in updates:

&amp;#x200B;

The only real question at this point is if this is a data error or if there are legitimatley all these borrowed shares. If we put this in the context of the float it looks even worse because institutional ownership is revealed to really be 148.28m/112.70m = 131.57% of the float!

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since the hedgies got caught with their pants down on GME with what turned out to be 140% of the shares shorted, this could be a telling sign that the same setup actually exists and is being cleverly hidden if you don't do the math on it.

&amp;#x200B;

With all the popularity around CLOV there is absolutely no wonder at all why the stock had such a massive 80% plus spike the other day. The reason is Delta.

&amp;#x200B;

As fellow degenerates purchase everything from FD's to long calls, they are requiring someone on the other end of that contract to purchase the delta in shares. Why? This is called  delta hedging. I'd hate to reduce it to this but its literally in the name of ""hedge fund"".

&amp;#x200B;

Example. Stock xyz has a delta of 0.25 and you want to write a bunch of calls on it because well it cant go tits up. So you end up writing 10 call options. You total delta is 2.50. This translates to around 250 shares (0.25\*10\*100) needing to be bought to cover. This is an algo thing at this point in the stock game and so generally this hedge is just written into the systems.

So our hedgie buys 250 shares, writes their calls and everythings great. Then the nightmare happens that all call writers hate, the stock starts to upswing and swing up sharply. Your delta increases and NOW you HAVE to buy whatever the upswing in delta is. If delta moves to 0.75, to stay delta neutral you must purchase 500 shares (0.75-0.25\*10 call options =500 shares ).

&amp;#x200B;

What we saw when this thing started to take off is delta screaming higher. I know that its around 0.55 right now for the short term options and up to around 0.61 for the leaps.

All in all considering that supposedly 71.43M shares are available, this seems slightly impossible for the stock to have rallied that hard and how is all the volume even possible if everything is not borrowed so heavily?

https://preview.redd.it/mhiffcbf9j471.png?width=1118&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8ac73194aa022959e1d847367209c845c958ddf

&amp;#x200B;

745.60M shares traded hands. Even at the open at $16.60, this equates to $12,376,960,000 in dollars spend and that is being extremley extremely conservative.

So why is the stock down af these past 2 days? Well because someone fell asleep at the wheel and is now trying to avoid another GME and AMC fiasco.

The only real question at this point is if this is a data error or if there are legitimatley all these borrowed shares. If we put this in the context of the float it looks even worse because institutional ownership is revealed to really be 148.28m/112.70m = 131.57% of the float!

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since the hedgies got caught with their pants down on GME with what turned out to be 140% of the shares shorted, this could be a telling sign that the same setup actually exists and is being cleverly hidden if you don't do the math on it.

&amp;#x200B;

With all the popularity around CLOV there is absolutely no wonder at all why the stock had such a massive 80% plus spike the other day. The reason is Delta.

&amp;#x200B;

As fellow degenerates purchase everything from FD's to long calls, they are requiring someone on the other end of that contract to purchase the delta in shares. Why? This is called  delta hedging. I'd hate to reduce it to this but its literally in the name of ""hedge fund"".

&amp;#x200B;

Example. Stock xyz has a delta of 0.25 and you want to write a bunch of calls on it because well it cant go tits up. So you end up writing 10 call options. You total delta is 2.50. This translates to around 250 shares (0.25\*10\*100) needing to be bought to cover. This is an algo thing at this point in the stock game and so generally this hedge is just written into the systems.

So our hedgie buys 250 shares, writes their calls and everythings great. Then the nightmare happens that all call writers hate, the stock starts to upswing and swing up sharply. Your delta increases and NOW you HAVE to buy whatever the upswing in delta is. If delta moves to 0.75, to stay delta neutral you must purchase 500 shares (0.75-0.25\*10 call options =500 shares ).

&amp;#x200B;

What we saw when this thing started to take off is delta screaming higher. I know that its around 0.55 right now for the short term options and up to around 0.61 for the leaps.

All in all considering that supposedly 71.43M shares are available, this seems slightly impossible for the stock to have rallied that hard and how is all the volume even possible if everything is not borrowed so heavily?

745.60M shares traded hands. Even at the open at $16.60, this equates to $12,376,960,000 in dollars spend and that is being extremley extremely conservative.

So why is the stock down af these past 2 days? Well because someone fell asleep at the wheel and is now trying to avoid another GME and AMC fiasco. Trust me when I say someone on the other side of this stock is having sleepless nights. I'm entirely convinced that there are no shares available at all and data backs me up on this too.

You will notice that from this chart there are only 300,000 shares available. Remeber the delta at 0.55? Well this means 55 shares must be bought for every  contract so if anyone purchases 5,454.54 contracts then there would literally be no shares available.

The very next day after this the stock came down from a gap up to 10 to about 9 and then BOOM breakout happens that very Monday and Tuesday (even wednesday at open really). They had to put out the fire and this is why the stock came down at all is the shorts trading all these shares between themselves. You'll notice however this is a very expensive endeavor as the fee is 117%. If they do not put this fire out now, this stock is going to cause billions and billions and billions of losses for hedgefunds and they do not want another bust to go down.

Just for a little sprinkle on top, BOA just downgraded the stock today with essentially reasoning that it looks too high ü§® the ol bad news to drive the stock down is going to backfire.

TLDR

CLOV does not have any available shares, every options contract you buy forces hedge funds to purchase 55 more shares. There are at best 300,000 shares available just off the June 3rd low of only 15,000 shares being available and if 5,454.54 contracts (which anyone can do that math that even a small whale could make this occur) are bought there would no more shares from this standpoint either.

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at the current state of shares available this puppy is ready to pop off and its just a matter of time regardless if your involved or not.

&amp;#x200B;

There are many times that people predict a massive  short squeeze and people just promote random things like naked short selling but this is not what is going on here.

&amp;#x200B;

Let us begin with the short interest.

&amp;#x200B;

Shares outstanding: 148.28M

&amp;#x200B;

shares outstanding - insider shares = 112.70M

&amp;#x200B;

Normally we would look at this and say welp 112.70M - 41.27M = 71.43M shares floating around and this would be very difficult to force a squeeze on as GME had maybe 50,000 shares available during its last squeeze with the proper adjustments in place.

&amp;#x200B;

However things get very interesting :)

When you look at how many shares are held by institutions the number is 106.25%

&amp;#x200B;

This is obviously highly irregular. Say you look up a regular stock like AAPL, you will find % owned by institutions is 58.69%, AMZN is similar at 59.32%.

&amp;#x200B;

With this said, this implies that 148.28m\*1.0625 = 157.54m shares are owned by institutions ü§™

&amp;#x200B;

We already discovered that there are only 71.43M shares available. This can only mean that there are 86.11M shares that are literally duplicates in some way.

Investopedia explains that this could be due to a delay in updates:

&amp;#x200B;

When you look at how many shares are held by institutions the number is 106.25%

This is obviously highly irregular. Say you look up a regular stock like AAPL, you will find % owned by institutions is 58.69%, AMZN is similar at 59.32%.

&amp;#x200B;

With this said, this implies that 148.28m\*1.0625 = 157.54m shares are owned by institutions ü§™

&amp;#x200B;

We already discovered that there are only 71.43M shares available. This can only mean that there are 86.11M shares that are literally duplicates in some way.

&amp;#x200B;

The only real question at this point is if this is a data error or if there are legitimatley all these borrowed shares. If we put this in the context of the float it looks even worse because institutional ownership is revealed to really be 148.28m/112.70m = 131.57% of the float!

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since the hedgies got caught with their pants down on GME with what turned out to be 140% of the shares shorted, this could be a telling sign that the same setup actually exists and is being cleverly hidden if you don't do the math on it.

&amp;#x200B;

With all the popularity around CLOV there is absolutely no wonder at all why the stock had such a massive 80% plus spike the other day. The reason is Delta.

&amp;#x200B;

As fellow degenerates purchase everything from FD's to long calls, they are requiring someone on the other end of that contract to purchase the delta in shares. Why? This is called  delta hedging. I'd hate to reduce it to this but its literally in the name of ""hedge fund"".

&amp;#x200B;

Example. Stock xyz has a delta of 0.25 and you want to write a bunch of calls on it because well it cant go tits up. So you end up writing 10 call options. You total delta is 2.50. This translates to around 250 shares (0.25\*10\*100) needing to be bought to cover. This is an algo thing at this point in the stock game and so generally this hedge is just written into the systems.

So our hedgie buys 250 shares, writes their calls and everythings great. Then the nightmare happens that all call writers hate, the stock starts to upswing and swing up sharply. Your delta increases and NOW you HAVE to buy whatever the upswing in delta is. If delta moves to 0.75, to stay delta neutral you must purchase 500 shares (0.75-0.25\*10 call options =500 shares ).

&amp;#x200B;

What we saw when this thing started to take off is delta screaming higher. I know that its around 0.55 right now for the short term options and up to around 0.61 for the leaps.

All in all considering that supposedly 71.43M shares are available, this seems slightly impossible for the stock to have rallied that hard and how is all the volume even possible if everything is not borrowed so heavily?

https://preview.redd.it/mhiffcbf9j471.png?width=1118&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8ac73194aa022959e1d847367209c845c958ddf

&amp;#x200B;

745.60M shares traded hands. Even at the open at $16.60, this equates to $12,376,960,000 in dollars spend and that is being extremley extremely conservative.

So why is the stock down af these past 2 days? Well because someone fell asleep at the wheel and is now trying to avoid another GME and AMC fiasco. Trust me when I say someone on the other side of this stock is having sleepless nights. I'm entirely convinced that there are no shares available at all and data backs me up on this too.

You will notice that from this chart there are only 300,000 shares available. Remeber the delta at 0.55? Well this means 55 shares must be bought for every  contract so if anyone purchases 5,454.54 contracts then there would literally be no shares available.

The very next day after this the stock came down from a gap up to 10 to about 9 and then BOOM breakout happens that very Monday and Tuesday (even wednesday at open really). They had to put out the fire and this is why the stock came down at all is the shorts trading all these shares between themselves. You'll notice however this is a very expensive endeavor as the fee is 117%. If they do not put this fire out now, this stock is going to cause billions and billions and billions of losses for hedgefunds and they do not want another bust to go down.

Just for a little sprinkle on top, BOA just downgraded the stock today with essentially reasoning that it looks too high ü§® the ol bad news to drive the stock down is going to backfire.

TLDR

CLOV does not have any available shares, every options contract you buy forces hedge funds to purchase 55 more shares. There are at best 300,000 shares available just off the June 3rd low of only 15,000 shares being available and if 5,454.54 contracts (which anyone can do that math that even a small whale could make this occur) are bought there would no more shares from this standpoint either.

All good counterpoints, esp as relates to AMZN deal. What an investment like that shows me, however, is the potential value AMZN (through its world class DD team) sees in the potential of this company. That means something, I think, even if AMZN ‚Äî wait for it ‚Äî intelligently crafted themselves an out in the deal if material economic factors turned negative (it‚Äôs what any of us would have advised AMZN if asked). 

As for TSLA and EV, remember that (1) EV‚Äôs really pertain to cars at this point, not long haul trucks or buses, (2) we are truly decades away from having the EV infrastructure in place to truly replace gas, and (3) our power grids are still heavily dependent upon fossil fuels to charge those EV‚Äôs (coal, predominantly). Arguably, if we stood back and looked at this from a high level, we‚Äôd overhaul our grids first, but that‚Äôs a massive problem to solve; EV‚Äôs are low hanging fruit, both from an economical production and energy usage perspectives. 

We can‚Äôt go cold turkey EV from gas; just doesn‚Äôt work. Has to be a green bridge, esp as our long haul trucks and buses are concerned. Hell, if CLNE could figure out a way to make RNG jet fuel (physics and chemistry are not on their side, u fortunately), then they‚Äôd be the next AAPL as far as stocks are concerned.  

That‚Äôs not only what I‚Äôve read (there are always many sides to any argument), but what I think feels like common sense and conventional wisdom. Again, only time will tell.

205,2021-07-06,"Usually when things go to shit, you can spot it well in advance. I remember back when smartphone sales were teetering and semiconductors were having issues... tech everywhere was starting to miss earnings numbers... that was Feb 2018... I told myself to wait rather than buy puts. I held my AMD and finally bailed out in the summer at $30. Then it all gave out in the fall, with favourites like AMD, NVDA, AAPL and others getting hit. It was months of damage and chaos, and then very early in 2019 everything started to rocket higher again.

He very well may be correct about this stuff, but maybe the market takes until Feb of next year to digest it and panic? The same thing happened in 2007... all the bad economic data didn't crash things until part way into 2008! Burry was well over a year early back then, which was painful. He and the OP may be correct, but timing a crash is tricky. Most investors don't have a clue about this stuff, so it won't cause them to sell. They'll probably just buy the dip. Funds with constant streams of retirement money coming in also always buy the dip.",Kramy,wallstreetbets,205.0

Stock corrected the next day, and he sold the right to sell the stock at that price. The right to sell the stock at that price had increased because the price of the underlying stock had come down to be closer to, meet or be below the target price.

A crappy analogy is if you're driving and see the car in front of you veer into the right lane and you bet that he's probably going to veer back into the Kane he was in. Maybe he's changing lanes, if so you lose the bet. But if he comes back in the lane after he looks up from his fucking cell phone, then you'll when the bet.

Op bet that aapl and co. would correct a little bit after being at ath yesterday.

The surprising part is that the premiums didn't wash out the gains.

The price of those bets is usually set based on magic‚ú® that seems to be pretty accurate to how likely they are to happen. Correcting a titch seems pretty likely, so it's not surprising it happened, but it's surprising the cost of that likely bet was still low enough to be worth it.

And then see how tomorrow afternoon goes. Too much instability after a fall like that. Bears are licking their lips, loving the fear, and want that $425.

Then train yourself not to make assumptions of patterns on anything less than 15 minute intervals, and zoom out to spot trends.

Once you're able to read the chart/book you can look into things like RSI, VWAP, EMA(50 &amp; 200) and add those together with your candlestick reading to be able to time things much better(entries and exits).

Being able to understand WHY a stock will have a specific magnet/resistance/support level is absolutely critical to any sort of long term success.

My question is this: how close does the underlying price have to be to put me at risk of someone exercising early to capture the divvy? Is it just simple math?

The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe).

3,2021-08-02,"Since you are broke af and I don't like seeing people who have no idea what they are doing lose their money when they are already broke, here are my two cents: 

Your stock picks and play are shit, and do not ""Do your part"" since this is not an organized group and almost everyone is here to make money for themselves and only themselves, and so should you.

If you want to make money do not put your money in any of the ""hot stocks"" since your risk of ruin is pretty massive, though if you are a degenerate gambler who wants to treat Wallstreet as a Casino go ahead maybe you'll be right this week. Safe and Stable that will make you money are companies and funds like SPY, MSFT, and AAPL. High Risk and Volatile that may have higher returns are like ROKU, TSLA, and AMD. 

HOOD is not going to die/continue to go down since every retard on WSB and new investor is basically still using their platform. If you try to short it at open I guarantee you will have your asshole ripped open wider than a goatsie picture if you hold that position for more than a couple days since your only option would be to short sell it, aka what hedgefunds did before getting gaped for $4bil on GME. There is a lot of buy pressure behind the company so I wouldn't be surprised if it goes above IPO price within a month and higher by EOY.

Police have zero interest in enforcing COVID rules as well. Fact is, COVID is over unless a variant that seriously poses a risk to vaccinated people arises. Even China is not going to do any major shut-downs as they will destroy their economy if they do so. Last time, they understood everyone else in the world would have to shut-down after them, so their draconian shut-down enabled them to start-up industries while everyone was sitting on their hands. This time, if China shuts down, it will boost manufacturing around the world and hurt them for a long time.

The math checks out: 2.4T/6.5B = 3.7. AAPL should be worth almost 4 times as much as BRK.A per share. I'm buying 08/13 $1,500,000Cs on AAPL. Not a weekly so the market has time to adjust. See you losers from the moon üòé",SlothyPotato,wallstreetbets,16.0

You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe).

&gt;The DTCC guarantees that the transfer will happen and eliminates the risk of a single broker going under rippling across the market.

&gt;In exchange, the DTCC collects a fee per trade and requires some collateral from the brokers to ensure they have the assets to complete the transaction. It‚Äôs like putting a refundable deposit on a purchase that reduces the middleman‚Äôs risk while the package is in the mail, with full payment due once it arrives. The DTCC‚Äôs collateral requirements for brokers are calculated by a much more complex formula, based on the specific shares‚Äô notional value, volatility, and other variables.

&gt;For a relatively risk-free transaction‚Äîin liquid, less volatile stocks like, say,¬†[Apple](https://www.barrons.com/quote/AAPL)¬†(AAPL) or¬†[Microsoft](https://www.barrons.com/quote/MSFT)¬†(MSFT)‚Äîthat collateral requirement could be around the order of 10% of the transaction value. For a stock like GameStop this week, the DTCC‚Äôs formula might spit out a collateral requirement several times higher than that because it takes on greater risk. That‚Äôs because the DTCC could be on the hook to deliver an asset that‚Äôs worth a materially different amount on the settlement date than the trade date if one of the brokers involved can‚Äôt complete the transaction.

&gt;When traders are using margin to buy, the broker needs to come up with the cash on its own. And when there‚Äôs a large imbalance between a broker‚Äôs buy and sell orders for a given security, it doesn‚Äôt net out as cleanly at the end of the day, meaning more collateral is required.

&gt;All of those factors applied to Robinhood and Gamestop on Thursday. The stock traded in a wide range from $112 to $438 on heavy volume, its users were predominantly placing buy orders for the shares, and many were using margin.

&gt;And those are the reasons the DTCC asked brokers for more collateral for each such trade. The clearing house didn‚Äôt want to be caught with brokers not having the funds they need to settle. Therefore, Robinhood and others restricted buying on these highflying stocks until it could come up with enough cash to pay collateral. Robinhood allowed users to sell the stocks because the selling broker puts up the shares as collateral, not cash.",Kildragoth,wallstreetbets,21.0

25,2021-08-04,"Legit answer here: your stock picks are shit. If you are trying to gamble your positions are awful because you're basically playing roulette and betting on green when the payout is 0.2 to 1 if it hits. If you literally pick all WSB stock picks you are actually a retard chasing after the train after it's already left the station, or going to your local palm reader for financial advise.

My suggestion, throw a decent portion of your portfolio (25%-50%) at FAANG (FB, AAPL, AMZN, NFLX, GOOG) or similar stable high growth stocks in long-term (5 to 35 year holdings) long positions and you can play with the rest IF you are legit trying to invest. If you're trying to gamble use options so at least you can feel like you're in Vegas and lose just as much money twice as fast, my suggestion is starting with ITM call spreads for bullish and ITM put spreads for bearish until you get a feel for market trends, press releases, earnings reports, etc. I would almost always suggest to NEVER do OTM weeklies unless you know damn well what you're doing since that is normally just throwing money at the wind. But if you want to be a true WSB autist this is the way, everyone goes through that phase and some of us never leave and just eat -100% every friday.

Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe). So please, before you make a post on wsb asking whether AAPL has priced in earpods 11 sales or whatever, know that it has already been priced in and don't ask such a dumb fucking question again.",TheTahoe,wallstreetbets,5.0

I did this one SPY, RUT and various big blue chips (AAPL, MSFT etc).

14,2021-08-09,"[This is a really great post which explains a lot about price movement](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oy25tw/options_trading_exit_strategies_a_guide_to/)

But basically, it's the algorithms (which do the majority of trading in the markets):

From u/FluxTradesStocks: 

""An algo can read through an entire earnings report / news transcript / whatever and fire off a corresponding trade in a fraction of a nanosecond, meaning that they‚Äôre at a huge advantage since they have the ability to sell the news after the news event hits. This means that algos don‚Äôt have to prematurely exit their position until they confirm that the underlying security was priced properly. If the underlying was priced to perfection, the algo takes its profits once the news confirms it (very common behavior among algos - take profits once there are no longer any catalysts in play), thereby causing the stock to tank. If the instrument wasn‚Äôt priced properly, and there is a huge upside beat, the algo just stays in the trade and reaps the rewards, exiting at a later date instead. 

   
In our hypothetical example, let‚Äôs say $AAPL has just reported earnings.  
  
   
Scenario 1 : $AAPL is priced properly. The ER comes out, an algo skims it, and confirms that $AAPL was indeed priced properly. The algo then takes its profits (as per common algo behavior), and dumps the position as a result of the priced in ER. Many other algos do the same as well, and the stock price ‚Äútanks‚Äù, resulting in a gap down the following day, and many left holding the bag, even on a seemingly good ER. Welcome to ‚Äúpriced in‚Äù.  
  
Scenario 2 : $AAPL is NOT priced properly. The ER comes out, an algo skims it, and concludes that $AAPL was NOT priced properly. There was a huge upside beat. Instead of selling, the algo stays in the position because it knows that the underlying is undervalued based on the new news, and rides the wave up, exiting the position at a later date. $AAPL was not priced properly, and as a result, the news wasn‚Äôt priced in.  
  
   
In both cases, the algos win - they either escape with their profits, or ride the wave up for even more gains. Us humans cannot act as quickly as an algo, and thus we‚Äôll always be at a disadvantage when it comes to fundamental exits. We always have to exit our positions prior to news catalysts to avoid getting front run. News events are almost ALWAYS priced in. We can‚Äôt sell the news AFTER the news drops because we cant digest and react to the news fast enough. We can‚Äôt front run the algorithms, so we need to sell BEFORE any fundamental news catalysts, otherwise we run the risk of holding the bag. If there‚Äôs one thing I want you all to take away from this article, it's that you should always sell the news.""",h4ppyfolk,wallstreetbets,14.0

15% short interest on a ticker with monster volume like $AMC is nothing. A short squeeze with those metrics is next to impossible. It's like me saying $MSFT or $AAPL is gonna short squeeze.

Now, if you're referring to a gamma squeeze (which is what happened last time), that's also impossible, since the OI on the options chain is less than 1/15th of what it was the first time, and there's no upwards price pressure, meaning we have no way to get the ball rolling.

27,2021-08-12,"Everyone should learn the magic of **debit spreads**!

The greatest thing about debit spreads vs long options is the fact that you are **not affected by Theta Decay**.  Few people realize this but as long as your debit spread expires in the money you get the **full** premium. For example:

Lets say we buy 10 **$AAPL 17th Jun 2022 $150.00 Calls** for $1,500 per option contract total cost = $15,000. 

If Apple closes at $151 on June 17 you are still **down $13,000 on that play or a 90% loss**. Apple needs to close around $180 for you to double your investment. Theta decay could erase the value of these options incredibly quickly even if Apple stays flat for a few months. 

Now lets compare it to debit spreads:

We buy 70 **$AAPL 17th Jun 2022 $150.00 Call**

We sell 70 **$AAPL 17th Jun 2022 $155.00 Call**

Price for each spread is $2.15 now which gives us a total cost = $15,050. 

Now if Apple closes at $155 or higher on June 17 instead of being down 90% you will collect the **full premium** and your spreads will be worth **$19,950** return of $5k. Each spread is worth $500 at expiration and you paid $215 each.

9,2021-09-02,"Sell way OTM CCs on stocks you already own, so like 30 delta at most but 15 delta is safer and probably free money.  PMCC underlying should be the same criteria as if you wanted to just be long on the stock itself but the long call is cheaper than the stock so you can play on shit you couldn't afford to just buy 100 shares like AMZN, TSLA, etc.  

&amp;#x200B;

If you want a better strategy than the wheel, what I do is size my position in 200-share minimum size and then buy-write 100 shares with a CC and then a CSP for the other 100 shares, so basically a covered strangle.  Profits from both sides of the wheel, is as directional as you want it to be (but generally directional with positive delta), and captures profits from gains in the underlying instead of fucking right off with those like if you're just selling a CSP with the wheel.  If you get assigned on your CSP, then switch to just CCs.  If you get assigned on your CCs then either go back in or switch to another underlying.  I might get assigned on MARA if it keeps going up, but if so then I'll get assigned at 43 where my entry was 30 and my adjusted basis is probably closer to 25 so that's not bad for 6 weeks or so on a single position in a $10k account (actual account is closer to $35k but I'm pretending it's only $10k so I can practice this shit without blowing up my account).  This strategy ONLY works because we're in the longest bull market in history, but because of that I want to be more directional.  If we get into a crash, then chase your underlying down with CCs and roll to 50 delta every time your CCs hit like 80 delta to lock in the intrinsic in the contract for a small additional profit.  Also sell call credit spreads as it falls and buy back in at the bottom with all the premium you made during the fall.  On the way up, put credit spreads and CSPs will make you more money.  If it stays at the bottom, then condor the fuck out of it and set a limit buy like $1 below your short call so you can turn that shit into a covered call and a long call; if it drops then just take assignment on the short put if you like the stock.  


For PMCC, the good part is you can use it on stocks you can't afford so NVDA, AMD, TSLA, AAPL, MSFT (premium is shit though), FB, etc.  It's also a much more efficient use of capital than an actual CC with the stock in terms of your ROC since you can hold more positions (so trade more positions but trade smaller; read up on the Kelly Criterion for gamblers to figure out position sizing).  With 10k I'd recommend 3 positions with a maximum of maybe 4 or 5 positions at most.  With any options selling strategy, your goal is to get rich very slowly but consistently.  Aim for like 1% per week and you'll do fine.",professor_jeffjeff,wallstreetbets,9.0

The key is (and it‚Äôs no key), that the biggest funds have upward of 90 billion in assets under management. They control the movements in stock price; but with so much capital, the only way they can manage it is to trade on macroeconomic headlines, with a ton of hedging, all through the use of algos. It protects them, but it causes the markets to move in the most irrational ways.

One sector is hot for a couple of weeks and then drops 10-30% for seemingly no reason. It‚Äôs fools gold to chase the trends. You‚Äôll end up being a bag holder over and over again. Capitalizing on the irrationality is where I find success. 

I have learned to trust my instincts and just let the whales come to me. When they slammed AAPL down after the best ER ever‚ÄîI bought and waited. When they did the same thing to AMD‚ÄîI bought and waited.

I just don‚Äôt see it down for long,  Jerome is still writing cheques and everyone is fucking complacent about this shit.

It‚Äôs going to take a hedge getting margin called and their AAPL, MSFT, AMZN and GOOG will be liquidated too fast because the greedy fucking Banksters want their money before end of Q4, then it will be on.

I am fully committed to watching my SQQQ and UVXY from here until end of March 2022 go up in flames. It‚Äôs been a good year and those are my lottery tickets.

I don‚Äôt blame you for betting on a one-time payout before the tech is truly ubiquitous, but China has been sniping technology for the last 50 years and they don‚Äôt give a fuck about your fucking patents or the stock price you foolishly think those patents command. They will reverse-engineer the shit out of it.

177,2021-09-10,"How most people do TA is bullshit, it's true... and you're 100% right that you have to take into account all of the externals and understand the limits. The thing is... because the stock market is a 2 dimensional representation of a time sequence, it does have solid dynamics which can be used to inform price action on specific events. For instance, here's an example where I didn't use TA and fucked up:  


The other week when SPCE got grounded I got excited and bought puts right after the news, thinking it would continue to collapse. Had I done TA beforehand and not given in to FOMO, I would have saved myself a couple hundred bucks because I would have seen that the stock had already landed near the last strong support point. If I had done the TA beforehand, I would have noticed that the support point was unlikely to break in the timeframe I had selected.   


I just got excited when I saw AAPL crashing. This time I did the TA and saw that it was approaching a support point and avoided buying puts, saving myself money.  


There are relationships between these things, and it's totally because of the dominance of algorithmic trading. The key is to know when the statistics matter and when they don't, which can be difficult. Many of the assumptions in TA, like in the OP's post, assume that prior correlation means prediction and that needs to be back and forward tested to insure that bias hasn't entered the analysis and that a person isn't just confirming a bias by mixing variables that don't actually relate. People assume the patterns are magic, but the truth is that you have to understand how a stock trades in order to understand the chances of a pattern realizing, and that's all about whether people or computers are the dominant force, and whether the catalyst is technical or human. If someone is applying a technical argument to a human process (like a crash) without bridging a technical catalyst in (like, say, a securities packaging, rating, and hedging scheme that had significant systemic risk that wasn't accounted for based on the poor assumption that housing would be stable even if people couldn't afford it, like in 2008) that has a predictable outcome, then that TA is not valid.

He bought few others but back then you needed to get papers and shit to buy and trade. It took commission and all. 

Since 1991, he had forgotten about the shares until he saw a article about aapl and realized around 1996 he still had it. He checked it and realized he had lost almost half of his value. So he promptly sold it.

42,2021-09-11,Tim cook is going to gape you. You'll be down a minimum of 50% by Oct. I'm here for it. Amazing how many apes throwing tons of money at AAPL like they forgot the several AAPL drops between Sept 2020 and May 2021.... Took nearly a year for AAPL to recover from the Sept drop last year,RonDiDon,wallstreetbets,42.0

48,2021-09-11,"Honestly? Because you need three things. 

You need at least 2,000 in your account to freely trade and be completely fine with losing. That means it can't be an emergency fund, it can't be a food fund, and it can't be a rent fund. Why? Because you would eventually need that money and there will come a time when you'll have to pull from your account to pay bills or sell early for fear of losing it. Having more money means you can buy more expensive options MUCH closer to the actual price. It's all a percentage game. You can get into an AAPL call that is only 2% from ITM as opposed to 5 that are 12% from ITM. 

The next thing you need is conviction. What do I mean? I mean, you have to KNOW you are right and KNOW what you believe. If you think a company is going up and based on actual research, and reading, and chart staring, and technical analysis, and maybe even some wsb ape DD, believe in something, you pull the trigger and let it run its course. Don't bother sweating over small losses, let it run, and hold your position. Too many people panic sell at open. 

The last and final thing you need is time. Time is your enemy with options. You will always pay someone else for the time left until expiration. It's important to buy calls with over 45DTE to avoid paying too much. This requires patience. You can always go long with shares to hold your portfolio steady and throw money into calls/puts but you need to be ready to let it ride for a week or two before taking profits or losses.",InspectorDabbit87,wallstreetbets,48.0

50,2021-09-11,"Don't even ask the question. The answer is yes, it's priced in. Think Amazon will beat the next earnings? That's already been priced in. You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe).

I'm down $80,000 in just the last two weeks. Dumped my positions going into that brutal close yesterday only to have the V recovery today. I bled for weeks only to sell the day before I needed to.

The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe).

Our last major pullback was of course 12 months ago... at SPY 355-360.

We just topped around SPY 450-455 a month ago.  Just an unreal 25+% run over the past 12 months.

I'd feel really good about buying if we dip into the sub-400 range, but it'll probably require us to see an actual debt default in 2-3 weeks to reach that level (who knows whether that will happen, those types of ""debt ceiling"" events have always been overhyped, but maybe not this time).

More importantly than that, a lot of high growth stocks have been consolidating all year and if that happens to big tech for an extended period of time, we could see a bigger 6-12 month sideways range (like we saw from mid-2015 to mid-2016 during that taper tantrum/interest rate hike/debt ceiling episode where S&amp;P 500 didn't have a new high for almost a year).  Probably worth at least considering how we should trade if that comes to pass.

How would you trade if MSFT/AAPL/GOOG/FB/AMZN are basically range bound for 12 months and then maybe only banks and some re-opening plays and smaller value caps are moving up.

It's worth at least planning for a ""sideways"" year like that as markets absorb tapering + interest rate hike expectations to come.  Going back and looking at stocks in 2015-2016 and how they traded is a worthwhile idea.",zg44,wallstreetbets,14.0

1. Apple   
It's hard to believe that one of the world's largest companies by market capitalization was once in dire straits. While never actually filing for bankruptcy, **Apple (AAPL) was on the verge of going bust in 1997. At the last minute, arch-rival Microsoft (MSFT) swooped in with a $150 million investment and saved the company.**  
  
People have speculated that Microsoft only did this because it was worried that regulators would regard it as a monopoly without the competition from Apple in the marketplace.2Ôªø 

&amp;#x200B;

Taken from: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/02/technology/apple-stock-1-trillion-market-cap.html  


SAN FRANCISCO ‚Äî **In 1997, Apple was on the ropes. The Silicon Valley pioneer was being decimated by Microsoft and its many partners in the personal-computer market.** It had just cut a third of its work force, and it was about 90 days from going broke, Apple‚Äôs late co-founder, Steve Jobs, later said.

I‚Äôm a rank amateur at this game. I have three kids, aged 14, 12, &amp; 10. About 7 years ago they were each given 10k from their grandpa to open an investment account. I opened an account for each them here in Australia trading on the ASX. I‚Äôve only purchased blue chip shares that pay 4-10% returns year in year out, and all those dividends are reinvested back in to those stocks when issued. Each birthday I give them $1000 to add to their portfolios, and $1000 each at Xmas. The eldest two are sitting on almost 75k each, and the youngest is just under 70k. 

By the time they‚Äôre 21 and have access to their accounts, they should have around 150k perhaps more if the bank of mum and dad don‚Äôt raid itü§£. It gives them a leg up to start their lives. They‚Äôre not allow to blow it on cars etc, they can use a bit for travel, but I‚Äôm hoping it can get them in to the property market and or keep the portfolio going until they‚Äôre much older. They‚Äôve had one really lucky break with one share which has doubled and makes up good slice of their portfolio and pays big dividends each year. That aside it‚Äôs been pretty basic investments. If it was the US market it would stocks like MSFT, CRM, TSLA, AAPL that I‚Äôve tipped money in to. So relatively low risk and just playing the long game and I‚Äôve not sold a single share in that time.

* Hype, global domination, etc. dream phase.  Some never even make it past this.  It's incredibly speculative and volative.
* Those that survive enter the ""actually making money"" and ""promise might be real"" stage.  There's typically a ""validation"" of bulls here and a huge rally.  IMO TSLA is here.  However, the future becomes more clear which can be good and bad.
* Final stage is mature and either monopolistic or semi-monopolistic company like AAPL, GOOG with an extraordinary strong barriers to entry, extreme margins WITH growth.  That's the dream destination.

IMO TSLA is not GOOG.  100 years of history in the auto industry doesn't change when you swap out a ICE for a battery.  It's basically impossible to establish a sustainable moat and capture insane margins for any prolonged period.",mediumrarestonks,wallstreetbets,51.0

My view is that all cars will be EV in the future, with or without a ban. I had a gut feeling when I first held an iPhone in my hands in 2008 - that all phones will be keyboardless smartphones one day. But I was too dumb to throw all my money in AAPL at that time.

In 2014, I bought a Model S, and I had a similar gut feeling - this time that all cars would be EVs one day. Again I was too dumb to throw all my money in TSLA at that time.

In summary, you do you, I'll do me. Eventually, I came to my senses and I've plowed virtually all of my net worth in TSLA beginning late 2019 through early 2020. I trusted my instincts and as a result, I've 10xed my investment and put myself in a position to retire before 40. 

I'm not ""pretty damn certain"" that governments will ban ICE and the world will be virtually 100% EV by 2035, but I think it will be whether or not these laws are passed. Had I waited until I was ""pretty damn certain"", I'd still be sitting on the sidelines.",mpwrd,wallstreetbets,46.0

51,2021-11-05,"Well, for starters, May 2022 is not a LEAP. LEAPS are at least a year.

And yes, this strategy, quite frankly, is the secret to having consistent options success - buy LEAPS on solid companies with consistent growth.

That said, there are downsides.

They are usually significantly more expensive, so, sometimes you need a big move in order for LEAPS to pay out - especially if you choose an OTM strike. This is a big problem if the stock does not move in the direction you are expecting, as you‚Äôre putting up more capital that can potentially be lost. Believe it or not, even a titan like AAPL could be down on a one year period.

And the gains are muted compared to shorter dated options (and I don‚Äôt mean weeklys, which are gambles) on say a 3-6 month time frame.

Car companies legend to be in single digits (I am NOT saying Tesla is ""just"" a car company and claim ignorance on that matter.)

The theoretical price of a stock is the net present value of all future earnings. As such it is overvalued. Sure, maybe it reaches AAPL levels of profitability in 10 or 20 years (likely not ever). Meanwhile AAPL has made 0.95 to 1.9 trillion of profit (23 billion per quarter) in the meantime (10-20 years).

So far the shortage has cost 2.2 Million vehicles. That could just be a tiny fraction if Taiwan has more serious future issues such as natural disasters or a China invasion, which could cost businesses TRILLIONS in damages to companies such as:  Ford (F) , General Motors (GM) , and Toyota (TM), Dell Technologies (DELL),  Apples (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), AMD, NVDA, and many more.


&gt;The group, which also includes the governors of auto-producing states like Alabama, said the shortage had cost automakers 2.2 million vehicles and affected 575,000 jobs in the industry.

&gt;The semiconductor funding passed the U.S. Senate earlier this year by 68-32 as part of the broader U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, or USICA. But it has not passed the House of Representatives.

30,2021-11-11,"I think their is truth to your sentiment. Inflation, supply chain disruptions, oil politics, and climate change are all going to take a toll on economics. The markets are a reflection of the general economic situation. 

That said, here is my analysis. Not financial advice. 

Inflation will continue to run higher. The M2 money supply has increased from \~ $15T to \~ $21T from the start of the pandemic [\[source\]](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/money-supply-m2) . That is a 40% increase in money supply. This is the main driver for inflation. To date, we have just seen a fraction of the impact of this increased money supply.

When inflation rises, currency is devalued. Holding cash means you are losing money. So, people rush to invest. The investment options are stocks, bonds, and commodities. 

The rise of stock prices, is a direct result of the increased money supply. But to justify the rise in prices we should see a rise in earnings. So far the EPS for the SP500 seem to have caught up with the rising prices. Pre-pandemic, EPS was at $35.5 which grew to $48.4 [\[source\]](https://ycharts.com/indicators/sp_500_eps). This justifies a price increase for the SP500 to 4700 - 4800, without drastically altering the P/E multiple. Here, there are two crucial assumptions, 1- the stock market works in a vacuum which it doesn't, 2- the earnings will not slow down.

Since the stocks don't work in a vacuum, then we need to look at other investment options. The safest of all, Bonds. The 10Y bond currently yields 1.5%. That is 3.5% short of core inflation. In other words, bonds lose money. But looking at the charts, the bond yield has been rising and we may see a breakout to 2.5% or 3%. This will be determined by the Fed interest rate. If bond yields rise, some money will leave the stock market and take shelter in the safety of the bonds. Bonds are the safest investment there is. This will see a correction in the stock market. 

But what if, earnings fall AND bond prices do not rise. Then we have a bunch of new cash in the market causing inflation and no return on investment on either stocks or bonds, then commodities rise. This means that industrial metals, energy, agricultural products all increase in pricing. We have seen this happen at the beginning of the pandemic when monetary policy was easy yet stocks earnings dropped. If you have spare cash then you better have it in gold or precious metals. Those are assets that have little to no utility but they will simply hedge against inflation. 

I think, we will see a mix of scenarios. Bond prices will rise but not enough to have any meaningful return compared to inflation. The actual inflation is higher than reported by the Fed. This will reflect in the form of rising commodity prices. The stock market will likely see a 10-15% correction at some point but nothing major unless something fundamentally changes with earnings. Still i would want to be invested in companies that are not deemed to overvalued or companies that are unprofitable. Yesterday, i decided to allocate 5% into a gold mining company ($SBSW) and over the past months i have allocated my investments into companies that are strong cash generators or pay dividends (eg. $AAPL, $WMT, $FB, $ATVI). Other investments that i am not so sure about or holding the bag include $BABA, $BA, $SPCE.",mzak88,wallstreetbets,30.0

3,2021-11-13,"Any broker will close unless  you have the funds for potential exercise. In AAPL that would  15k or 7.5k in margin plus at least in IB a safety net of 1k or so. 

Now if you have money you can get IB portfolio  margin account  which gives you 6.67/1 margin. You would  need less than 2k for AAPL play per contract  for example. But you have hold minimum  110k balance  for portfolio  margin.

- First ever 100% silicon battery ever to market. Many other battery mfgers only have 3-5% silicon.

- Enovix's first generation 100% silicon battery is 30-40% more efficient than any other battery. Imagine getting 30-40% more space in an iPhone and what a game changer that is. Or AR/VR glasses. Or any mobile devices.

- Eventually capable of creating EV batteries by 2025.

- Mobile device manufacturers speculated include SNAP, META, AAPL, HP, MSI. 

- Future customers could be the US DoD as silicon can be mined domestically and turned into batteries. The second the government labels batteries as critical infrastructure means Enovix will be in a prime spot to take advantage of that.

The biggest problem right now is just that the ""smart money"" is unloading at an unprecedent rate.  You have hedge funds reducing leverage substantially, insiders selling at an abnormal rate (some of it is tax considerations, but it's still big numbers), and it feels like retail is going to keep getting caught on the wrong side of these trades: see small caps/high growth the past month where everyone piled into those in late September.

Retail is currently all piling into the 10 mega cap lifeboats, but if we see heavy selling there, could see a quick 5-7% plunge on everything in late December.

I think we're seeing a late 2018 redux but on a quicker timeline (think 6 weeks instead of 12 weeks).

It's just worth considering being a bit defensive the next couple of weeks because we're seeing extreme bearish sentiment while mega caps are still near (or even at in the case of AAPL) all time highs.

Of course, the counter to all of this is that most of the ""negatives"" are starting to be baked into the cake: first case of Omicron in the US, dramatically faster tapering being priced into bond yields, etc.

I'd rather own $100 of AAPL than $100 of US treasury bonds.  Not a doubt in anybody's mind which is a better investment.

And that's why markets don't have to completely collapse here.  Yes, stuff like MongoDB or NET or (insert any bubble cloud/tech name) need to come back down another 40-50%, but I don't think this is going to be a carnage filled mess like 2000 was.

Given high inflation and low bond yields, stocks are really where you have to keep money.",zg44,wallstreetbets,10.0
11,2021-12-04,AAPL .. Bulls keeping the dumpers at bay .. jump in 180+  ejaculation imminent. Can you smell  what Tim is Cookin?,DogeEm,wallstreetbets,11.0
12,2021-12-04,"That's what makes this selloff so different.  Mega caps/big caps are pretty much holding everything together because everyone's rotating to them out of worry about the rest of the market.

The big difference now to other points in history is... there's not really viable alternative investments.

If you dumped GE/Intel/Cisco/Microsoft in 2000 well at least you could go and put your money in bonds at a decent yield.  Or find something else worth buying.

Right now, where can you put your money?  It's better in AAPL or PEP or PG or COST than bonds.  Right?

So ultimately that's sort of providing a strong line under markets.  Can that continue? To an extent it can; I don't really see why massive amounts of passive money would be pulled from those types of large caps given that they are reasonably priced businesses with good growth/prospects.

The thing about 2000 which a lot of people forget is we had 9/11 and a mini-recession as well as significant rate hikes.  Those all converged with the tech bust to result in a massive selloff on equities.

It's not clear yet that we have to see the same massive selloff in equities here.",zg44,wallstreetbets,12.0

6,2021-12-08,"I should've been a little bit more specific, sorry.

I started out with 40k savings, and bought almost all AAPL/MSFT/QQQ shares in 2016 and held until now. A lot of those stocks have gotten 400%+ gains over the 5 years. Then every paycheck I got throughout the years, I kept putting money into stocks into a mixed ratio of safe stocks vs high-risk stocks. I would always make sure that I was allocating most of my portfolio into safe stocks, and a small portion into riskier option plays. I would never risk more than 5-10% of my portfolio on option plays / earnings plays / meme stocks / what have you. I made some big mistakes on options, and made some gains on options. In the end I think I only profited a little bit, and I still have a ways to go when it comes to learning how to be a better options trader. However, my ""long term"" stocks have mostly always gone up, and by safe I mean I was periodically buying AMD, TSLA, NVDA, HD, FB through the years on top of the FAANG that I already had and \*never\* selling. I misspoke when I said I turned 40K into 400K. It was more like I started with 40K, and kept adding money in (from my paychecks) and buying brand-name stocks until my portfolio rose to 400K. In the end I think out of the 400K total amount, almost 100k of it was my own capital from the money I saved from my paychecks from 2016-now (which includes the 40K I started with). The rest were gains. I know this goes against the entire WSB mantra of YOLO-ing everything but at the end of the day, long term stocks are rewarding with patience. The YOLO part is all fun but \*extremely\* high risk and may not be the best idea if you can't handle big losses. Hope that makes sense",AshamedEstate1974,wallstreetbets,6.0
7,2021-12-08,"TL;DR Omarova is out, banking and financial sectors about to rip because of the Dark Pool.

Aight retards, listen up.  Your next plays through the coming days are going to be in XLF and the financial sectors. 

Why?

That C U Next Tuesday, Omarova just withdrew her nomination for banking regulator. 

Why is this important? Because she scares the shit out of everyone from Wall street to Crypto. So, withdrawing her nomination is a pretty gat damn bullish signal for the banks to go all hog wild and pump up their stonks. 

Not only that! But, after the close (and this was not a MoC order mind you) I spotted a Dark Pool trade of 22.3mil block trade traded on XLF at 39.27. 

Over the last month, BAC has had the heaviest Dark Pool activity with a 9.5mil print at $43.60 on 12/3/21 (if the average daily volume on BAC is 41.6mil, that's 23% of that daily volume in one trade) followed by IBN and ITUB. Personally I wouldn't mess with those tickers. Even though IBN does have the heaviest Dark Pool activity out of all the banks, it doesn't move enough for options to print. 

BAC is the 3rd heaviest weighted stonk in the XLF portfolio, trailing only BRK/B and JPM. But since JPM and BRK/B don't really have any real Dark Pool activity behind them, it's safer to say that BAC is your best best to ride to tendy town. Now, BAC does have some crayon drawing it needs to break through, but if it can get above $46, then its got a real shot at testing new highs at $48.69. Get through that and you're into blue sky territory. 

But, BKR/B can move a lot more than BAC. And this is WSB, we want to YOLO our entire life savings on shit $100 OTM expiring right fucking now. BKR/B (Buffets company) doesn't have any crayon technical indicators on the daily chart to get through, and if the XLF and banking sectors really start to rip, BRK/B should rip in sympathy as well even without any Dark Pool activity. 

Not financial advice, just my own observations. 

Or, you could ignore everything I wrote and go yolo everything on TSLA and AAPL. That'll probably work out too. Or not.",Shtonky,wallstreetbets,7.0

So we really need a blowoff type move on those names or rotation to some stressed names to drive the next move.  Of course we just saw GOOG and MSFT go straight up for a year so it is possible for AAPL to melt up to 200.

It's just worth thinking about those types of things when you consider how bullish or bearish you are.

If you look at AAPL's run the past month, AAPL only really has had a much bigger run one time and that was right after the pandemic started during the massive tech melt up in the middle of 2020.

203,2021-12-09,"The cloud storage functionalities are actually similar and, in some cases, better for Dropbox. Check this out: [https://www.cloudwards.net/dropbox-vs-google-drive-vs-onedrive/](https://www.cloudwards.net/dropbox-vs-google-drive-vs-onedrive/)

You'd be surprised, but actually the number of users between DBX and MSFT/GOOG/AAPL doesn't differ that much. Dropbox has 700mln+, Google Drive reached 1bln last Nov so it's probably around 1.1bln now and I couldn't find user stats for MSFT. iCloud is obviously targeting Apple users. I think they had 620mln users in 2020 (Source: [https://www.businessofapps.com/data/apple-statistics/](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/apple-statistics/)) although this says they had 850 mln in 2018 so I'm not sure about the correct latest number (Source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/11/apple-could-sell-icloud-for-the-enterprise-barclays-says.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/11/apple-could-sell-icloud-for-the-enterprise-barclays-says.html)). BOX only has 77mln so they're the little fish in the big pond. My point is that Dropbox actually has a comparable number of users to the likes of Google, Microsoft and Apple. Box is lagging behind massively especially given the fact they've been around since 2005, even before Dropbox which was founded in 2007.

Google and Microsoft seem to target businesses more, whereas DBX is focused on individuals, small businesses, creators, self-employed people, etc. It's a different target market and that's pretty much it. The cloud storage market size is big enough for all of these. It's easy to dismiss DBX, but looking at the details draws a different picture.

Few things

* If you zoom out on SPY, it's mostly a *linear* line (albeit already mostly vertical) thanks to Fed zombification rations. But hardly ""endgame exponential"". We have another 3-18month finale yet. Think Roaring 1920s style. Things are about to get REAL crazy.
* AAPL and tech carrying market. Yeah. I mean if you zoom out the shit is pretty vertical and matured. Look at internet corn struggling. There are whispers of a top. But the fun thing is you never know how big a bubble it'l be until after it go boop. And that's the reason bubbles form, because the best R/E is to buy into it instead of betting against it and trying to time the top.

I think this next week will likely be the ""beginning of the end"" of that kind of move as the Fed tips its hand on rate hikes next year (dot plot) and moves to bring tapering to a fast end.  That's the final ""shock"" that the market needs to absorb.

AAPL is in a similar situation to where TSLA was at the end of October, when TSLA was passing $1000 in the final part of its blowoff move to $1200.

I would not be loading puts on AAPL until we see volume slow and and there isn't the massive firehose of money flying into the stock for safety.

When you took this screenshot, AAPL was about $175. So $40 over your strike, and the bid/ask is in the low 50s. Doesn't seem to me like you're getting a lot of credit for the time remaining on deep ITM leaps.

I'd expect to see it go up a lot more in the next year and you can realize a lot more of that growth. They're up 50% on the year. If they do that again, it'll be at $270 in a year and you'll be sitting on multiples of your current profit.",johnny_cash_money,wallstreetbets,87.0

93,2021-12-13,"I think she knows what she is doing. The problem is narrative. She has given the impression to the world that investing in up and companies that will change the world will beat the market by a significant margin. She was proven right because of the interest rate climate of 2020 and finding it hard to repeat her success in 2021. These companies are also interest rate dependent which actually makes them bad investments and she most likely knows that but she would probably never admit it.

That leaves her with trading these companies on a frequent basis and as the size of the fund grows, it becomes hard to beat the market with hyperactive portfolio management. Now, she can admit all this or she can spin a tale about how boomer companies like MSFT and AAPL are equally good at innovation and investments. This will actually bring her closer to market returns and with some luck and work she would be able to beat the market. But, I doubt she will ever do that.",satya314,wallstreetbets,93.0

130,2021-12-12,"I don't know what to tell you, man. Seeing as a little while ago you said that Tesla is ***struggling*** to crack 750k units per year, when they are going to easily exceed that. It seems like you can't even get basic numbers right.

&gt;They're struggling to hit 750,000 this year (they'll probably come in at right around 800k.) 

Seems like a contradictory statement too. Struggling to hit 750k, but you expect them to get to around 800k? I don't understand how that fits with the ""struggling"".

&gt; and that optimistically hopes to hit 2 million by 2023, 

End of 2023, yes. Again you're implying they will be struggling to hit a number for some reason? While it looks like you don't even have a handle on the relevant numbers.

Again, if there is 0 growth of sales/production in Q4 compared to Q3 they will hit 860k. A \~70% growth. There is every indication they are going to top Q3, though.

Anyway, Q3 They produced 237k cars. 

Let's round it up while being conservative and say 240k per quarter or 960,000 for a year.

This year or early next year 2 new big factories will come online. Each bigger than the Shanghai factory. If I recall correctly.

How fast can a factory ramp up? Shanghai went up to production of 3500 cars per week in Q2 of it's first full year of operation. This after a shut down due to the corona situation and other pandemic related obstacles. Giga Shanghai reached around 8000 cars per week production around the end of the year 2020.

So, I don't think it is optimistic to say these new factories will do 3000 cars per week on average in 2022. 3000\*52\*2 = 312,000.

312,000 + 960,000 = 1,272,000. 

Then in 2023 the production rate of the new factories likely starts at 8000 per week. Let's be conservative and say it stays at a flat 8000 on average per week. Even though Shanghai was around 10k- 12k per week in november (it's second full year of production). 8000\*52\*2 = 832,000.

1,272,000 + 832,000 = 2,104,000.

Remember, this is while assuming flat growth rate for their existing factories. And ignoring the expansion in production capacity already happening at Giga Shanghai. And assuming no new factories will be built in 2022 and complete in 2023 to add production capacity. 

So I'd say 2mil by end of 2023 is actually conservative, not optimistic.

&gt; is worth five times as much as Toyota, a company which routinely sells about 10 million cars per year

The Toyota that aims to have production of 2 million BEV+FCEVs by 2030? The Toyota trying to make Hydrogen Fuel passenger cars happen, even though it is a dead in the water technology? That Toyota? Aside from that they are more into hybrids. Hybrids which will look very unappealing very soon. I sure hope they change their tune.  

Anyway, unit sales by itself is a number that is literally meaningless. Tesla has better margins. Their operating margins actually went up by a lot during this troublesome year.

&gt;Even growing 100% year over year, it would take Tesla basically until 2030 to get to a reasonable P/E, assuming their stock price didn't go up.

What? Growing what 100% year over year? Sales? Production? Earnings/Net profit? For every year until 2030?

Sorry for the questions, but this seems so silly that I must be misunderstanding something.

100% YoY number of car sales gets you to 440 million cars, so that can't be it. So net profit then?

Even just taking their Q3 net profit of 1.6B, so just the one quarter and take that as for full year 2021, and then doubling every year you get to 819B net profit end of 2030. 

$AAPL, an almost 3 trillion dollar market cap company, had 95B in profit fiscal year 2021. So, I think 8 times that would be enough to justify 1/3 the market cap of $AAPL no?

However, Tesla's net profit will likely be around 4B this year compared to 600Mil in 2020. A \~6x increase, but they won't be going 6x every year obviously.

Even just 40% YoY profit growth based on 4B in 2021 will get up to 82B profit in 2030. Again, $AAPL an almost 3 trillion dollar company had 95B in profit fiscal year 2021.

Looks like they will easily grow into their P/E with 40% YoY growth, let alone your suggested 100% YoY growth. So, I'm not sure what you're saying here.",tms102,wallstreetbets,130.0
