To answer your second question. It was a formula based on a few factors that are rate of interest, the strike price vs the underlining price, dte, volatility. This encompasses the mathematical modeling of the statistical probability of a given asset moving to a given price and then assesses and odds. The odds is then used to be converted to a price. That's why your broker can quote you the odds.

All this is explained on any google search and the formula is all there to see. It's pretty straight forward for any person who has a stem degree to understand.

The formula is a pretty accurate representation for correct pricing as the market makers uses some derivative of this model to make a market. The only drawback is that it tends to underestimate leap prices as tail risk is not factored into this equation.

If the model was incorrect in accurately pricing option premiums you could employ statistical arbitrage and reap the spread of the mispricing. Are you suggesting that you have such a formula?",FullTime_Autist,wallstreetbets,15.0

This gives you solid leverage (usually delta about 0.3) without losing too much money to time value",j33tAy,wallstreetbets,2.0
3,2020-02-08,"Hey. Didn’t read all the comments. I sold credit spreads for 2 years as my full time job (by “full time” I mean I worked 15 minutes a day). Everything went really well. I placed I don’t know how many trades, thousands upon thousands. I sold spreads 30-45 DTE delta 12 on short put, $500 spread (or difference of $5 between long and short e.g. 150/145 strikes). 

I live in a low cost-of-living country, and was making between $2000 and $10000 a month, so I had way more money than I needed. Moreover, I had a success rate of over 99.5%, so you can guess how big of an ego I had.

In October of 2018 I decided to take my boyfriend on a trip to Paris and Beirut. I put us in expensive hotels and took us to the fanciest restaurants. 

I was convinced I had found what I was going to do for the rest of my life.

During the trip my positions started going against me. I stupidly didn’t bring my computer with me, and at that time it was difficult to close spreads on the Interactive Brokers mobile app, plus the internet was shoddy in Beirut and I just figured it would turn around like it always did and I’d fix it when I got back. I sold more spreads into the downturn, thinking there was no way it could get worse. 

On the last day of the trip we were in the airport in Paris. It was a Saturday, and I opened my account out of boredom to see that my $170,000 account was now worth $100,000. 

Over the next week I tried desperately to repair my positions but it was nearly impossible. Every day I was waking up to margin calls or $1 million or $2 million, getting assigned left and right. I was trading ETFs like SPY, QQQ, and IWM, so not even anything that risky.

By the end of the week, my portfolio was worth $30,000; and I was on the verge of a heart attack. I lost $140,000 in six days. I closed it and walked away.

I wound up having to go back to work. 

Anyways, I am writing this to you to tell you that assignment can happen at any time on American-style options. You have to be very careful with put spreads because you can easily get assigned on the short put; and if your long put has expired by the time you realize you’ve been assigned, you’re up Shit Creek.

Morals of the story - holding spreads to expiry when the short put is near the money is a bad idea; and if you go on vacation or go somewhere without good internet, it’s better to close everything before you go, or at least the positions that will expire while you’re away or are close to the money.

If by Monday it gets to $303 (2.6% well inside of the 51% implied move) you will profit around $110. On a 4% (which happened last Monday) up move you will make about $275 while only risking $99.

Recognize ""theta gang""/option writers are most effective at making profits selling options =&lt; 45 days DTE and they do well. As an options holder/buyer one has to be able to ""go long"" and be strict with following risk and money mgmt and understand how to pick tickers/contracts having the ""greeks"" with best potential and avoiding those with the worst potential. Similar as it is in the world of investing in mutual funds/ETFs in a 401k/IRA (diversify and avoid pricey managed load-fee funds) there is such a thing as diversifying in options trades (not all-in on SPY or SPY and QQQ, place only small % on a position, include a contrarian position, don't overpay, always keep sufficient ""dry powder""/cash equity that allows for repositioning in trades you believe in but market moved against in near term, have plan when to enter/exit before making a trade, don't get emotional, cut losses sooner rather than later, etc).

Again in your BA example, your enemies is theta and vega right now, theta is time and vega is VIX (in stupid terms, its more complicated but just think it as VIX for now). So right now VIX is falling of a cliff, so lets say you buy that same $122 BA with 30 DTE (days till expiration), and it goes to 121 but it took the whole 30 days to reach there, your profit its going to be shit if any, because it bled theta all the way thru and vega went down a lot. Highest risk bet would be to buy a 0DTE contract just 1 strike OTM or the first ITM (as long delta hasn't reached 1, which usually the first strike price ITM hasn't) if you are sure its going to move in the direction you want, but you have no wiggle room for errors and you are most likely going to get fucked, that's why 0DTE contracts are so cheap.

4,2020-04-10,"To be fair, last week was a sideways market SPY 253-248. Theta IV decay killed both long calls and puts. That's where spreads or shorting options was a winner.

This week was a complete melt up. I done messed up waiting for the red day that never came to sell my puts, market zig zagged more during the March 3wk 35% crash than it did this week. I blame Fed unlimited QE. Tue was a total head fake for shorts, opening 275 and closing at 265, looking like a trend reversal. 

Props to the call holders who held overnight Tue. Longs who held with conviction this week deserved their hard earned mega profits.

Lesson for me this week is in order to reduce risk, best to day trade or hold options for a short time with tight stop losses to preserve capital. The overnight gap can be a killer (or huge moneymaker) for options too.

1. Don't fight the Fed, esp long term. And until sentiment changes, bad news is good and good news is even gooder for prices. 

2. I'm waiting for a pullback to sell my shorter expiry puts, can't sell now cause they're practically worthless. Def scaling back on my longer DTE puts which still have some IV premiums left in them. Wait for a cheaper put re-entry once trend/momentum is more suitable.

3. And I gotta trade both sides, can't stay perma-bull or perma-bear.

3,2020-05-06,"In a normal earnings cycle (understanding that, at this time, nothing is quite normal in the market), nearer term expirations would generally revert back to a normalized IV. This normalized IV can be approximated by looking at the IV of much further expirations. [In tastyworks IV is readily laid out for each expiration and greeks are shown for each position](https://imgur.com/a/CbWoSbC). 

So BYND should be normally carrying around a 90% IV. Crush value would be (vega) * (difference in IV). So for the June position that would be (12.45) * (101.8% - 90%) = about $124.5. 

Outright expected move for an expiration cycle is calculated as (stock price) * (IV) * sqrt(DTE / 365).

9,2020-05-08,"I don’t do 3$ ITM, I just do spy levels I’m comfortable with. So for example, I have been using 283 as my short leg for any calls, while using 280 as my long because qqq is at near ATH, and we know tech has a hard time going down. Thus, spy will have a hard time tanking past levels like 283. Furthermore, 2-3 Dte has very heavy theta drain on the short leg and thus you can get profits like 20% per day. It’s Also a bit more risky though, if you get blown out, then you only have 3 more days for it to come back your way. As for your spread, you are already at max loss, so I recommend leaving your spread as is, if at any point spy goes down a bit, you can bail out. But again, do go too bearish on spy right now because imo it’s hard for it to crash since tech is maxed, if the other companies gain even small amounts, spy jumps, for example look what happened tonight.if spy is going to crash, tech needs to crash first. So I wouldn’t hold bear spreads overnight. If you are rich, you can run like 5 bull spreads every 2-3 days and just buy a single long dated put.

2,2020-06-05,"Oy now i feel bad. You're new here. If SPY trades sideways your option will slowly lose value, because currently it has 0 intrinsic value, all of the value is in the potential for SPY to go past 325. 

But for help with your question. What if SPY hits 325, what am i missing out on? This is how I would do it:

Go to your expiration (6/19). You want to know how much your option is worth if SPY is at 325 and you have a 325 call. Because you want to know how much your option will be worth if it is ATM(At the money) we will look at the 319 call, because it is ATM(we closed at \~319). The 319 call  is worth \~$4.68. So we can assume that if on Monday we open at 325 your call will be worth $468 minus some small time-value from the weekend passing. 

What is your call worth if SPY hits 325 in ONE week from today? OK lets look at what an ATM call on SPY with 7 Days Til Expiration is trading for! The 319 call expiring 6/12 is trading for \~3.50. So we can assume that if SPY hits 325 in ONE week, your call will be worth about $350. We look at the 7DTE option because in one week your option will have 7DTE. 

Using this method you could estimate what your option would be worth if we were at any price on any date. For example, let's find out what the call would be worth if SPY closed at $315 in a week. If SPY closed at 315 in a week your option is $10 OTM. So lets look at an option with 7 DTE that is $10 OTM.  The 329 call with 7 DTE is trading roughly .54 or $54. As you can see with time passage and a slight move out of your favor you will lose almost all gains. 

If you're unsure about anything here let me know and I can try to clarify.",Long_term_Andy,wallstreetbets,2.0

10,2020-06-08,"I know it feels like you're missing out on am awesome bull market (and you are), but there's always more opportunity in the future.

If I dumped every penny I had in my brokerage account, I'd be about 60% of your account - not small, not huge. Here's what I have learned about my trading by reviewing my wins and losses:

I almost always lose on big (25k+) plays and win on small (&lt;5k) plays. On the big plays, I'll see a few thousand loss, lose confidence, and bail out. On small plays, I'll see a much bigger % loss, be confident in my thesis, and hold for gains.

I lose almost all my day trades, win almost all trades I hold at least a week. 

Tight stop losses almost always trigger for me. Setting a 2% stop loss in this market is basically a guarantee of a 2% loss - stocks trade up and down 2% a day all the time in this market. Don't buy if you're not confident enough in your research to look at a 2% loss and know it's fine, it'll go back up. Or buy less, risk less (per play). 

I am about 50/50 on bought options, and 95/5 wins on sold options. Check out r/thetagang and read up on selling cash secured puts - it's a great way to make some money while waiting on a good entry point to a stock you like.

I'm up about 9% on SPY, up an average of 20% on shares in individual companies (even though I bought into spy earlier in the bull run). Individual companies are better than etfs for me when I do the research.

EDIT: I forgot an important one - I have seen my best returns on long dated (120+DTE) calls. Every time I buy options with less than 30DTE, I lose

There are lots of good sectors/companies that are still trading at 40% or more under ATH, so don't just look at FAANG. Not saying FAANG is overvalued, just that it feels a lot safer to invest in something like USFD, XOM, BA, JPM that's still well under ATH vs buying into AMZN or TSLA (or etfs like QQQ) hoping it continues to moon well over ATH.",TJnova,wallstreetbets,10.0

I closed my SPG 65c 6/19 position too early because I was impatient and missed out on 900k profit (can't think like that but sometimes you gotta before you can let it go mentally). Lesson here is, if you have enough conviction in your trade, you would ride out whatever negative storm is coming.  


I feel you man, but when I was down like 70% -350k on this position, there was no way in hell I was gonna close out for that big of a loss. I would rather see it go down to 0 by 7/17 then close out.

Here's the list for calls and puts. 

[Call tendies index](https://imgur.com/a/oTedfP2)

[Put tendies index](https://imgur.com/a/NdyZy9L)

**EDIT**

**Updated list as of 90 mins after Open**

[Call tendies index 90min](https://imgur.com/a/jo9KzON)

[Put tendies index 90min](https://imgur.com/a/B9Dt9dB)

A bunch of them on the call side, if they hit Wednesday closing price are going to be 40 baggers, like BAC.

BAC is at $24.8, $25.5C expiring today costs $0.04, and on Wednesday close it's $26.51.

The script also filters our poor liquidity options to ensure it's relatively reasonable to enter and exit them.

To elaborate on the columns,

**Tendies Index** - How many times the option will multibag if price target is hit at expiry, assuming you can enter midpoint between bid/ask

**NTR** - A modified ATR value using past 10 days true range, but discard the highest and 4 lowest, then averaging the remaining 5.

**Price Target** - Current price + NTR = Price target for calls, Current price - NTR = price target for puts.

The way to use this is, if you think the probability of hitting price target is greater than 1/Tendiex Index, then it's a trade with expected positive value. I believe option mispricing do occur at a higher rate in extreme cases like far OTM 0 DTE, or Thursday before close. Still, this is just a good filter, you'll still need to pick your plays.

If you expect a daily rally you can do 10% ITM 0DTE and you won’t have to worry about it expiring absolutely worthless in most scenarios.

2,2020-07-06,"Ok you're CLEARLY a complete and utter RETARD. The problem with this is that your focusing on what my options will be worth AT EXPIRATION. Nobody fucking holds until expiration. It's absurd that you thought I would. No shit, most options expire worthless. That's why I buy 2 months out, because it gives me plently of time for the stock to move in my direction and get out a few weeks early if it doesn't go my way. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**That's incredibly wrong.** Here's an AAPL 385 call 45 days/1.5 months DTE: [https://imgur.com/a/Mo35i8Z](https://imgur.com/a/Mo35i8Z). Although it's a $385 call, it needs to reach $394 or higher to even **BREAK EVEN** at expiry.

This chart is AT EXPIRATION. Also, break even only applies to AT EXPIRATION. You can sell options before expiration which almost everyone does. This is enough evidence for me to realize that you're a complete retard and probably very new to options trading. No experienced trader would mention break even unless you plan on excercising the option. I don't have enough capital to buy 100 shares of AAPL or SPY, sorry. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;an additional factor is that you're long Vega **AND** you're expecting an increase in the price. This doesn't make a lot of sense since you're expecting the stock price to increase. 

No, volatility isn't a huge issue for me, and I don't see why it is for you either. As long as volatility stays relativily close, I'll have no problems. I'm not an idiot and I don't buy 80%+ IV options. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Yes, it is extremely different.** It's your risk and chance to profit and the amount of theta you incur. ITM has little to no theta whereas OTM has MASSIVE theta. That's an extremely powerful difference between the two. 

Maybe very OTM but as I stated before, I only buy slightly OTM. Also, I buy 2 months out so theta is not an issue at all for me. Again, I'm not holding until expiration. My goal is that the stock moves in my direction within the next month or so and I get out. Theta is not much greater than ITM in this case. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; **The house always wins if you're only going to buy options without an informational advantage or a stroke of luck.**

Not really, you're telling me the run up we've had due to the FED and QE is a ""stroke of luck"". My asshole. Obviously now that everything is at ATH or past ATH it's difficult to tell where we're headed but up until then it's not luck. It's a matter of identifying the trend and trading it, it's really not hard. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**I'm only frustrated because you think you're using a strategy with very good risk/reward ratios, but if you refer to the profit/loss options graph, you can see that the risk reward is actually dreadful** especially since gains are infinitely linear while stock movements on the tail-end of the spectrum are exponentially less likely to occur, despite your infinite potential returns that scale only linearly.

ONLY AT EXPIRATION. This is true if I was a complete idiot and held until expiration. I don't do that. If it goes in my direction and hits my profit target, I get out. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Buying options naked is a **BAD** strategy in terms of risk/reward. You can't deny this. You can say that, given your insight into the market, you do have an informational and flexibility advantage as opposed to institutional investors limited to lower-risk, more diversification, mass-liquidity limited choices of investment vehicles.

There is no such thing as buying naked. There is selling naked but not buying. It's actually a very profitable strategy if you buy the dips on a clear uptrend like i've been doing. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; And this doesn't cover other strategies like the Jade Lizard, where there's no upside risk, reward ATM, and double loss below the money

Stop trying to get me you to use your shitty strategies. I've got better things to do than learn what the fuck a ""Jade Lizard"" is. If it works for you, good on you. But I would rather capture larger gains without having to execute multiple legs and capping my gains. Also, it's difficult to assess whether I'm getting a good price with spreads whereas with simple calls I can view the price history and immediately tell if I'm getting a good value historically. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Buying an option is inherently unprofitable. No single option has over a 50% chance to profit.** An ATM option is only profitable 33% of the time on average for the buyer, and 67% profitable for the seller. An OTM option is around 20% or less profitable for the buyer. There is no such thing as high profitability options buying unless you mean ATM compared to FD.

No, you can literally view a particular option's price history and determine what it will be worth. That's how I know how much I will multiply my investment by. I can't do this with spreads. And once again, I'm not waiting until expiration so what you said isn't true at all. The fact that you fail to understand that options can be sold before expiration proves that you don't understand what I'm talking about. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The risk is also 100% of your capital. Just because your capital is low doesn't mean the strategy is low risk. You're using a high risk, low probability of profit, moderate return (with a potential of infinite return if expectations are greatly exceeded) strategy. It is inherently high risk low profitability by its nature. If you buy an ITM call on AAPL right now at $350, your chance to profit is 46%. The safest kind of investment as far as ONLY buying options is concerned. There is less risk because you only lose 100% of your investment if the price tanks a shit ton and ends up below $350. Otherwise, you get to keep some of your capital. OTM is inherently much higher risk because of this; you'll probably lose your entire investment if it doesn't end up profitable.

&amp;#x200B;

THIS IS COMPLETELY WRONG. All you have to do is look at a particular option's price history to see that you can make multiple times on your money if it goes in your dirrection. Again, sell BEFORE expiration. 

I can't believe you actually think that I hold until expiration. Nobody does this. That's why I think you're having trouble understanding the profitibility of my strategy. You don't have a basic understanding of options, even though you act like you do.",wsb_roulette,wallstreetbets,2.0
3,2020-07-06,"Let me pick apart and debunk your points since you decided to ambush me with a wall of text.

&gt; If you're expecting a stock to move to a certain price point, why not just buy calls at that strike price? You don't need it to reach that price, you just need it to move in your direction.

That's incredibly wrong. Here's an AAPL 385 call 45 days/1.5 months DTE: https://imgur.com/a/Mo35i8Z. Although it's a $385 call, it needs to reach $394 or higher to even **BREAK EVEN** at expiry.

Notice the three categories: Win, Opportunity Loss, And Loss. They're pretty self explanatory, except for the border and classification of opportunity loss. Opportunity loss is a strike price and time where you would profit, but you would profit less than an ATM or slightly OTM debit spread in place of the call. You can get 100% on AAPL gaining $3 over the course of 45 days. That's the opportunity cost you're losing out on while simultaneously incurring extra risk.

An additional factor is that you're long Vega **AND** you're expecting an increase in the price. This doesn't make a lot of sense since you're expecting the stock price to increase. You would do better selling an ITM put credit spread because you would be shorting volatility instead of longing it (unless your intention is to use Vega as a sort of hedging mechanism, then that's reasonable, but that's probably not your intention anyways. It's probably your lack of understanding of other strategies besides WSB-style option buying)

&gt; It's literally no different than buying ITM and having the underlying stock move in your direction.

Yes, it is extremely different. It's your risk and chance to profit and the amount of theta you incur. ITM has little to no theta whereas OTM has MASSIVE theta. That's an extremely powerful difference between the two.

&gt; I've been buying spy since literally 220

You mean the longest bull market in history? Yeah, that will make you win a significant amount. You could have won more with different strategies.

&gt; Judging by how you described your graph, you're strategy sucks.

Your* And my strategy for the downward portion of my graph, as I have previously explained, was from buying options. I made 30% up, 40% down, another 20% up, and some more down. The house always wins if you're only going to buy options without an informational advantage or a stroke of luck.

&gt; And btw, I can tell you're losing money like a little pussy based off the fact that you're so pissed off that I happen to have a different strategy than you. You're incredibly butt hurt by something and I assume it's because you've realized you suck at trading.

Ad hominem and ad hominem. I'm only frustrated because you think you're using a strategy with very good risk/reward ratios, but if you refer to the profit/loss options graph, you can see that the risk reward is actually not very good, especially since gains are infinitely linear while stock movements on the tail-end of the spectrum are exponentially less likely to occur, despite your infinite potential returns that scale only linearly.

Buying options naked is a **BAD** strategy in terms of risk/reward. You can't deny this. You can say that, given your insight into the market, you do have an advantage as opposed to institutional investors limited to lower-risk, more diversification, mass-liquidity limited choices of investment vehicles.

Debit spreads, Credit Spreads, and Strangles are the most efficient option strategies. Iron Condors are similar to strangles but are *slightly* less efficient due to your requirement of capping risk by buying two spreads.

&gt; You're clearly the stupid one here if you think I'm a gambling addict for risking 2% of my account to make 10% when I've been doing so consistently.

I was unaware of the amount you were using and I'm not entirely sure whether or not to believe you, but if what you say is true, then I respect you matching high risk with small position size.

&gt;  gambling addict would bet multiple thousands on a fucking bull shit term autists on WSB convinced him of. In that case, you sound more like a gambler than I do considering you've lost money due to quad witching. Maybe that's why you're so fucking angry and butt hurt, because you still haven't recouped your losses from some stupid bullshit you believed online.

???

What? Wallstreetbets fucking hates spreads. It's too hard to comprehend the $125cb/$130cs. If you don't fully understand how they work, you may be missing out on strategies that better-match your conviction of the market

&gt; You sound more like a gambler.

I have done intense risk assessment on a myriad of strategies. The most efficient, least efficient, which market to use which ones, the most long vega, short vega, long theta, short theta, etc. Here are the most common strategies: https://www.optionsplaybook.com/option-strategies/ And this doesn't cover other strategies like the Jade Lizard, where there's no upside risk, reward ATM, and double loss below the money. Every conviction has a strategy, and there are multiple bullish strategies.

&gt; In that case, you sound more like a gambler than I do considering you've lost money due to quad witching.

Yes, I was more like a gambler. If you paid attention to my mini-story, you will know I went from tea leaves and option buying more into an actual profitable strategy that involves mostly spreads. I've completely changed myself from option buying because it's gambling. Awful risk/reward. I'm up 150% since I started using spreads. Also, stalking is not nice.

I believe you reduce everything to puts and calls because you have insufficient knowledge of other strategies to apply.

&gt; Different traders have different strategies. I'm sorry if you have trouble accepting that. The fact of the matter is that I'm taking **low risk, high probably trades** with huge potential.

Buying an option is inherently unprofitable. No single option has over a 50% chance to profit. An ATM option is only profitable 33% of the time on average for the buyer, and 67% profitable for the seller. An OTM option is around 20% or less profitable for the buyer. There is no such thing as high profitability options buying unless you mean ATM compared to FD.

The risk is also 100% of your capital. Just because your capital is low doesn't mean the strategy is low risk. You're using a high risk, low probability of profit, moderate return (with a potential of infinite return if expectations are greatly exceeded) strategy. It is inherently high risk low profitability by its nature.

If you buy an ITM call on AAPL right now at $350, your chance to profit is 46%. The safest kind of investment as far as pure options buying is concerned. There is less risk because you only lose 100% of your investment if the price drops below $350. OTM is inherently much higher risk because of this.

14,2020-07-07,"I'm essentially trying to do this, but didn't set a specific dollar amount I'm trying to make.   I know i'm the boomer professor here, but I've also done extensive research on options strategies (after I lost a lot of money when I was younger, like it sounds like many of you have) and taking a more calculated and thought out approach than just ""all in 1800 calls!""  If you don't want to follow my strategy, I honestly don't really care...just ignore my post(s) but it might be helpful for someone.  Also, it's going to do depend on your bankroll the best strategy.

I (and some analysts) think $TSLA is going to keep go up, to at least $1500.  Fundamentals are no longer at play here so who knows how high.   However, my concern is that $TSLA raises cash soon.   The reason being that they could now do a huge secondary offering, and have enough cash to not only get rid of all debt but also to fund all operating expenses for at least 10 years.  $TSLA insiders have been selling shares for last month or so (for whatever that's worth).

Also, right now the IV rank in TSLA is high (67.4).  As I hope most of you know high IV = high options price and low IV = Low options price.

My trades today were selling  Jan 15, 2021 5 delta puts (ie. around 600).  I sold 4 puts, which gave me $12k in premium (and yes it required a lot of buying power).  Thus, I'm ""selling high"".   
 However, every day that goes by those become less expensive (ie. I could buy them back cheaper and make money), and if IV drops they also become less expensive.  Further, as long as TSLA doesn't drop below 600 by expiration they would expire worthless (and I keep all the premium).   

While this is a unique case, typically when an underlying goes up (or stays the same) IV goes down.  I'm guessing in the next couple days IV will drop a little.  If IV drops below 50 I'll close at least 2 of the puts (ie. buy to close).  Then I'll buy calls.  I'll likely buy 25-45 DTE calls with whatever profit I had from the puts I closed.   Then every day that IV goes up i'll sell at least 2 of the calls (to close) and buy more puts (to open).  Every day IV goes down (or stays the same for a couple days) I'll buy calls (to open) and buy some of the puts (to close).

That is to say, I'm going to try and use swings in IV to my advantage.  As I make money I make riskier trades.",ProfessorPhillyCPL,wallstreetbets,14.0

An ITM put accomplishes the same thing as a covered call, with less of a BP reduction.

\# Find hot stocks that move (Biggies)

\* Be cautious when IV &gt; HV

\* Buy 10%-15% OTM stock from the current price

\* DTE - 2 months or more 

\* Wait for it to be in green in 2 days or less

\* Exit - Put in a trailing stop loss with 20% trail

\* Exit when wrong - get out if it stays red on day-2

\* Close the position with 1/2 way  to expiration

2,2020-07-12,"I think all you can really do is show that you can consistently win.  But unfortunately strategies work until they don't... so it may take a long time trading before you can prove that you have strategies that work.

I'm in a similar position and decided that I will only do defined risk trades on options with high volume  (yes, I know, not very WSB of me). My play is this: I sell ATM put verticals if I think the stock will go up. That's about it. Sometimes it's 5 DTE, sometimes more. Sometimes I close at 25% or 50% profit... sometimes I hold until expiration. If the trade goes the wrong way, I close it at 25% - 50% loss. But I decide all this before I enter the trade, stick with it, and that makes my fiance (and as I've come to learn, I, too) more comfortable. Selling an ATM put vertical can still double your money or more if you sell it at the right time, so it's a compromise we can both get behind. Also, I never put more than 25% of my account into one play. If you're a bear you can do the same thing with ATM call verticals. To double the money I risk on a single trade still feels like YOLOing to me, even though it won't make me a millionaire overnight. Good luck, hope it works out for you.

I figured the shares could be nice as I could sell covered calls on what I ever I get to make the promotional value more than what they advertise. But they make you hold the shares for like 6 months and that could get boring.

13,2020-08-04,"Okay, so long story short, why you get destroyed by ERs in general is IV crush, which is where implied volatility doubles before ER and halves after ER. Basically if you bought a call or put, and the stock doesn't move hugely in your chosen direction, the value of that option instantly drops by -40%~, regardless of delta changes. This is why its recommended to sell before all ERs due to the gambling nature of price movement. Additionally, monthly expirations are usually set within 4~ days of most ERs, which means your monthlies turn into weeklies if you hold; so when you're wrong about direction, you lose huge on both IV crush and theta loss.

How I make plays through ERs and not lose my ass are 2 ways:

1) Buy much longer DTE options. For example when I'm playing ERs this month for Aug stocks, I'm buying Sept calls and LEAPs. When I'm wrong I can still baghold and get my money back. It's true I don't get huge paydays from gambling, I also don't obliterate my account Exodia Yu-Gi-Oh style.

2) Buy your options far out from ERs in general on red days. I make a list a month ahead of time for all ERs and update it weekly. I'm looking to buy on Thursday and Fridays 30+ DTE calls on things I like. So when IV jumps the week of ERs, you get IV love, not crush, which instantly gives you a 20%+ boost in options value instead of loss.",Rhaximus,wallstreetbets,13.0

My main taxable accounts are at level 4 and 5 options approval but I don’t sell naked options so I don’t actually need it.

LEAPS are just options with typically 1+ year DTE. Better for investing in companies without dividends and high growth potential. I usually buy ATM or slightly OTM on companies I believe in. For example I bought a Jan 2021 AMD 60C on a red day for $500 and after the insane recent run up it’s worth like $2K with 5 months left.

1. don't buy weeklies, especially for mega slow b\*tches like MSFT that move like they were shot in the leg

There have only been 15 days in history where the S&amp;P 500 has dropped more than 8% in a day and 8 of those 15 days were before the year 1940 (according to Wikipedia). Sometimes they are hard to fill, but they eventually go through. Am I retarded or a genius?

Actually since you’re a theta gang solider would you mind telling me if my logic on this hedge makes logical sense?  


Currently hedging with 3% of account in 120 dte 25%otm vix calls. Thinking of switching to this:

Short an ITM .80 delta vix call. Go long two further otm Vix calls such that they are consecutive strikes and you receive as close to a $0 credit as possible. Buy them 120 dte and hold till 90 dte and then roll so they are 120. The only way the trade loses money money is if I hold to expiration and my long calls are otm or atm. If they are in the money by a decent amount I can hold to expiration and still make profit.

Small spikes in vix help me slightly but not too much. If vix falls off a cliff I can buy back the short call for a profit and probably just keep holding the long calls since they’ll be stupidly cheap and still have time to expiration anyways to come back to life. Big spike in Vix like a June 10 sell off makes me a ton of money since the short strike delta is already close to 1 and the long strikes would then become around .8 and I’d have two of them.

40,2020-09-04,"You have ways to play defense, but I have to say, don’t ever sell options with less than 21 DTE.

1. Roll out. If the spread is not too ITM, then you can roll to a later expiration for a credit or small debit.

2. Roll out and down. If you roll far enough out, you can also change your strikes for a tolerable debit.

3. Sell a call spread with the same short strike. (Iron butterfly) I’m this way, you hedge against your losses, since both spreads cannot be simultaneously ITM. If the call spread is trading for a high enough premium, then this could be an attractive play.

4. Roll the long put down for a huge credit. This will widen your spread, effectively increasing your risk, but also netting you some nice premium, taking advantage of an increase in IV. This also serves to lower your break even. This is essentially a “doubling down” play. 

Take a few minutes to ask yourself — have my short and long term assumptions changed?

0,2020-09-07,"Copypasta:

I developed the following rules over many years of trading. When I started employing these rules I would focus on making $500 each day, and once I did I would stop. I would close the day in cash almost every time. Most days I would only make 1-2 trades, and some days I made exactly $500, some days I made $2000 on one trade. If I lost $500 I would stop and try again tomorrow with a clear head. Now that daily limit is much higher. It’s all about discipline. I have a notebook where I track all my trades and evaluate them, and the days I lose are the days I break these rules nearly every single time. Here are the rules:


1. Only trade with general trend. Example: if trend is bullish only buy calls at support and sell at resistance or ride up as it breaks resistance. Don’t buy puts at resistance and ride down to support when the market trend is bullish. 
2. Never risk enough to fall under $25k. 
3. Always set stop loss at -20%. Never ever ever ever hold a position past -20%. Sell it and put the remaining capital to work in a winning position. 
4. Never trade in the first hour. Let prices get established.
5. Take gains as soon as the trend breaks, the first break. 
6. 1-2 positions at a time. When I started this system it was 1 at a time but now I have 2 going some days. 
7. Focus on winning each trade and making a net gain, whatever that gain is. Do not focus dollar amounts. 
8. Diamond hands only applies to the winners. Cut the losers short and don’t baghold a losing position hoping for a turn around. 
9. Never get sucked into a meme. Do your own research. 
10. Order flow and volume are all that matter

Edit: to clarify I am daytrading with this strategy and only buy ITM calls/puts with high delta. I don’t buy OTM unless it’s a position I am holding long term, and in that case I only buy 60+ DTE and then only 5-10% OTM. I rarely do this anymore, I almost exclusively daytrade ITM. I will use the OTM strategy during earnings run up but always sell before earnings. I have definitely missed out on huge gains but for every one of those there are 4-5 positions that would have been losers if I held through earnings so I take gains and move on.",unknownmiffler,wallstreetbets,0.0

One more thing I thought of last night that you might look into is stock replacement strategy. Since you are trading stocks this strategy will allow you to do the same thing you are doing with increased leverage. You buy deep ITM call options that have a delta of 1 (or as close as possible). Then as the stock price raises by $1 the options contract also raises $1. So if a  stock is trading at $100 and an ITM call with delta=1 costs $10, when the underlying goes up to $101, the call option is now priced at $11 (a 10% gain on the option vs a 1% gain from the underlying). The challenge with this strategy is minimizing theta losses so I would utilize it when you are expecting the underlying to make a quick move up so you don’t hold the options too long or try to find contracts with 60+ DTE to minimize theta hit. I have never done this strategy with stocks so I cannot offer any additional guidance but thought you may want to check it out.",xyyyyyyyx,wallstreetbets,1.0

When riding to the next level I give the position a little wiggle room to see if it really hits a new resistance or if it keeps going because once it has broken through the original resistance I have more room to let it develop. But I always take profit and don’t diamond hands it hoping for higher gains. I don’t even think about money left on the table I only care about guaranteed money in my pocket. 

Regarding exp, I copied this from another response: I typically buy 7-30 DTE about $3-5 ITM looking for a delta of 0.60+. 7-14 DTE seems to be the sweet spot because there is no issue with volume and you can usually find 0.60+ delta easily.

One thing I'm still really figuring out is which options to buy for DT-ing. I like the volatility swing of expensive weeklies like NVDA and AMZN, but it's always quite a white-knuckle ride. I've also experimented with 45-90 dte 5-10% OTM calls --which are options I'd be okay with owning anyways-- but the price swings are less dramatic and it requires way more capital in play.

14,2020-09-07,"Yeah regardless if we want to call them FDs or not, anything &lt; 30DTE is going to (usually) have wider swings in premium due to quite a few factors (theta, IV, OI, etc). The point still stands that a 10% stop on options in general, regardless of DTE, is just way too tight. Might as well trade ES with a 3 tick stop. Conventional wisdom for pure directional plays in options is 30% stop, 60% target (1:2 risk:reward) and that's typically on contracts 50-60+ DTE. I use different strategies so this doesn't apply to me but it's to make a point that a 10% stop is such a poor EV trade. 

It all comes down to finding trades that have a nice balance of risk:reward and probability. Traders need to learn how to calculate whether or not their trade is +EV or -EV as that is how you stay profitable in the long run.",beefcleats,wallstreetbets,14.0

If you have enough to day trade I'd say to average in and out of positions more. And if you ever find yourself up 100% or more average out half your position. 

If you don't have enough to day trade Id say cash out any risky short term plays at 100% up or more and do that until you get to the point where you can day trade to average in and out of positions.

Also if you can't day trade you can still average into positions. So say you're gonna throw 200 at a position. Place an order for 50 when you think it's right then wait like 15 min place another 50 then wait 15 min then place another 50 until youve got your whole position in place. I probably started entering the position around the same time as you but I did it over the course of like an hour.

1,2020-10-07,"Close but you missed out on a key detail - it’s based on the growing spread on SPY 30 DTE. The more change in the spread &gt; the higher the volatility measure &gt; the higher the VIX. It’s NOT based on the spread itself, but based on the increase of the gap between bid/ask. If today’s spread as larger than yesterday’s, volatility had increased. If today’s is smaller than yesterday’s, (even if it’s still a large gap) volatility, VIX and (and VXX calls) will fall. 

VIX is a tricky thing, and most VIX-based securities are ETNs (exchange traded notes).",sweljb,wallstreetbets,1.0
2,2020-10-07,"Depends on the type of spread, DTE, and which strikes you sell. The condors I closed early today had a max gain of $64 with a max loss of $36 each. 

I have to set $36 aside as collateral for each condor I open so my cost to open each spread is $36. So if I held to expiration, as long as UVXY was between $19-$24 I would make a return of $64 per spread, or 177%.

Of course it was farfetched to think a month out it would trade within such a tight range. But volatility doesn't move that quick. Even today with the crash it only went up 2%. So you usually have plenty of time to close out and start again if it starts moving too close to one of your wings. 

Anyway so those condors I closed early today were 19p 24c, 9/16 spreads. I got a 22% return on those over the past 3 weeks but had to cut it loose today. I got a little boost from mangos tweet luckily which netted me a few extra $ per condor. It would've been nice to get a 177% return but cant complain with 22%.",BornShook,wallstreetbets,2.0

6,2020-10-06,"I honestly have no idea what to do. Feel like a deer in the headlights. Had 10/9 and 10/23 3200 calls and was up HUGE and sitting pretty EOD Friday. Decided against my better judgement to hold the 10/9 call through the weekend bc FML. Now instead of making 90% profit, I sold that call for a 50% loss (-$6.5k swing in my portfolio) when AMZN hit $3150 today, thinking theta would never let it recover even if it went back to $3200 by 10/9. Decided to diamond hand the 10/23 call bc the longer DTE and earnings on 10/22. Now there's no stimmy coming and the stock is sub 3100 and drilling. Original plan last week was to ride the earnings wave and dump before the announcement (though part of me was tempted to hold through earnings on the chance AMZN made like ZM and mooned, especially given the upgraded price targets on Wall Street). Now I'll be happy to just have a big enough bounce to recover my losses somehow. Is it even practical to hope for that at this point? Should I just cut my losses? I honestly have no idea.

9,2020-10-06,"ITM debit spreads or OTM credit spreads both allow wiggle room/downside protection/upside protection (depending on your exact entry) while still being able to make money by expiration. High win rates are easily achievable when you enter a position that has some protection built in. Mind you, you're talking positions that may be (for example) risking $80 to win $20 on a $1 wide spread, but has 10+% protection for moves against you. The numbers will vary depending on DTE, IV, and the greeks of course.

Now I do agree that buying spreads on OTM long calls or puts is pretty stupid, as you do need a move in your favor and they'll print like crazy when they do, but that's not what a proper spread entry is.

FOR EXAMPLE, using $JPM's closing figures as of 10/6/2020 (2 minutes ago), the stock is currently trading at $98.02; you can buy a $95C and sell a $96C both expiring this Friday for around $.85. If $JPM finishes Friday above $96, both of your calls are exercised and you make $15. This play has $2 of downside protection built in and is still a winner. This is how high winrates are not only possible, but actually expected on proper spreads (the $JPM play is really not a good entry, I'm just spitting out an example of how they can make money while moving against you).

I strongly suggest you take a look at Tastytrade's library of multi-leg strategies on YouTube. There are PLENTY of ways to make money when a stock doesn't move or moves against you! Shit, sign up for a Tastyworks account and just copy their plays; the vast majority of the stuff they do has protection built in.

Selling csp’s to get stock cheaper and lower cost basis, then selling a strangle on stock when you get assigned on the csp. The biggest thing you need to manage is when to sell contracts targeting 30-45 dte. Some seem to think wheeling means you need to sell contracts as much as possible (or as soon as possible) but those that buy back contracts when they hit 50% profit to sell a new csp, tend to be able to stay ahead of current market returns. Another point is waiting for some reversal after getting assigned on csp, before selling cc’s. 

These kinds of strategies are a little more difficult to backtest. But I think In general theta strategies are ones requiring patience and a more systemic approach. 

High IV stocks can be great for the wheel. Saw somebody who wheeled Tesla just without selling the strangle (only cc) consistently returning 40-65% roc, but would be smart about when he would sell contracts and usually held stock for a bit before selling CC.",BluBraised,wallstreetbets,11.0

&gt;You’ll take a loss to buy it back; if that’s your strategy then you’re making directional bets, not collecting “free money” against an asset you already own.  
  
dumb  
  
&gt; When every single person in the thread agrees on something and you don’t, maybe you should reconsider who isn’t understanding...

&gt; Everybody knows how to roll a fucking call spread, it just doesn’t have anything to do with whether it’s smart or not to collateralize a short call with a LEAP. Rolling the calls whenever they’re at risk of assignment (1) reduces the risk of assignment of the LEAP and (2) reduces the expected value of the short position. You can’t reduce (1) to zero because sooner or later you run out of strikes or dates and because of (2) the more you roll the less you net, and so the less reason there is to try this strategy in the first place.

&gt; You should repost that one more time tho, just to be sure.  
  
double dumb  
  
&gt;You get a credit if you roll out at the same or lower strike and a same or greater DTE than the last short call, which you can’t do forever because your LEAP has its own strike and an expiration date, ya dingus. Who tf would begin this strategy by selling FDs just to give themselves more runway if it gets close to assignment? That’s the most retarded thing I’ve seen since I watched your parents fuck in the back of the short bus.

&gt;Yeah you can reduce your cost basis below zero and you do have to consider the underlying, but that implies you’re taking a directional position, meaning you must have some information advantage, you’re not just collecting “free money” in the sense of lending shares. That’s kind of my whole point, that this strategy implies a directional bias and it’s not going to pay off if you don’t have some information that’s not priced in. And if you did have that info you’d probably just trade off it directly and not fuck around with your leap.

&gt; Jeez you’ve totally ruined the afternoon semi I was nursing, thanks a lot

(In this instance, I wanted the furthest dated options, 10 contracts, and I wanted to spend less than 300k).  So what I landed on what $160C 3/24/23.   Sadly, when I bought them on Mondays peak, my break even was 473.

I only sell my covered calls at a point that is greater than my break even, so even if the underlying breaks through the strike that I sold at I'll generate a profit despite losing the time value of the LEAP.    I also sell them at a delta that is high enough that had I just bought the stock outright, I would have sold it.

So now I sell these between 480 and 530, with &lt;7 to 45 DTE.  This allows me to have a constant stream of income coming in, without having to constantly worry about the daily fluctuations of the stock price.  I generate a minimum of 4k a month and upwards of 10k.  This is more than enough to pay my bills, save a little bit, and still have my regular working income to do everyday stuff.   

If and when the underlying crashes, I do not start selling below my adjusted break even strikes.  That's a recipe for disaster.

theta always has an impact as long as there is time left on the option. you said 11/13 so 3 DTE. So if you multiply theta times how many contracts you have, thats roughly how much premium you are losing to decay every trading day.

IV could be related to a few things, we've lost IV due to erection results leaning one way, however i think it is still inflated somewhat due to the contesting/tweeting being done.


It could furthur drop is mango fully concedes. It could also drop if any events,earnings, announcements are coming up.

Then again, it could also pump if mango has some legal case to stand on and contest things.

^(one FD per week as a treat)",Burnt_toast_2018,wallstreetbets,11.0
12,2020-11-11,"Let's say the underlying is trading at 100, and the 45 DTE call at 100 is trading at a price of 5. This value of 5 is the amount the market judges is fair to compensate the seller for the risk of the stock being up in 45 days. Such a value is called **extrinsic value**.

Now take the 45 DTE Call at 90, trading at a price of 14. If you buy it, you can exercise it at once, for 10 (100 - 90) per underlying unit. 10 is called the **intrinsic value**. You can also see it as the value of the contract if the underlying does not move until expiration. What's left (4) represents the actual compensation to the seller for the risk of the stock being over 90 in 45 days, that is to say the extrinsic value. The extrinsic value decreases over time when the underlying does not move, which is known as **theta decay**.

As you can see, although the raw price itself if higher for the ITM option, you're actually paying less risk premium to the seller. That is because you yourself are taking the risk of seeing your instrinsic value disappear. You will lose less money through the passage of time (theta decay), but your exposure to the underlying itself (delta) is greater since you will lose more if the underlying decreases.

Out of the few stocks I do pick, I go an see what the ATH is for the year, thats my starting point.

I then look at credit spreads for those far otm, and ath numbers.

Out of all the stocks I picked, I pick the juiciest credit vs capital needed.

I then look at the MMM, if my strike is 2.5x near that I'm golden. Because it gives me extra safety from the anticipated move for that contract.

If earnings are early in the week monday or Tuesday, I get in right away or late in the day,  if they are wed or thursday ill wait because usually the stock climbs in anticipation and I can get a little more juice for them.

8,2020-12-09,"His losing has nothing to do with the stock price and everything to do with getting assigned on one of his short legs and his ability to cover. 

The main difference between him and 1ronyman is that he's going short term (Jan 21 or 38 DTE) vs doing LEAPS (\~2 years out). 

Also he hasn't posted any screenshots so have no idea what brokerage he's using. If he's using a good brokerage (and hopefully with this big of a margin call on the table he's called in instructions) then there is a time gap between him getting a short leg assigned and his ability to close the position or exercise his option. If he's using RH, then he could get massively fucked as they will handle it the shittiest possible way. 

It is a non-0 chance, but it also is a pretty low chance unless there is a short squeeze (current ratio is 0.48 since the stock is still majority owned by institutions) and the shorts panic to cover. In addition, the odds that all 300 short legs get called is extremely low, so provided he doesn't do anything retarded (much greater than 0 chance) he should have  $1M in cash sitting in his account.",scbtl,wallstreetbets,8.0
