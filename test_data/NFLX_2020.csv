No different when NFLX went from $200 to $50. 

Obviously not all stocks go up, but modern portfolio theory takes care of this. The loss on this stock would be offset by gains in others. Imagine holding MSFT, DIS, and AMD in the same portfolio. Your losses would have been more than offset. This is why they say diversify. It reduces value at risk(VaR). 

Also, day trading PCG isn‚Äôt guaranteed to have yielded no better results.  

Remember Tesla last year falling from $360+ to $100 a share. You likely wouldn‚Äôt have day traded that to profitability. From 2013 to present, only one technical study outperformed buy and hold.

1,2020-01-07,"Just to make sure you are going into it with your eyes open, this sort of trade is (or can be) high probability of success.  But when you lose, you tend to lose big relative to your wins.  One loss can wipe out many weeks of wins.

For choosing stocks, I tend to go for stocks that are slightly volatile (so that your premium for selling will be high), but not so volatile as to be crazy unpredictable and dangerous.  Usually I aim for stocks with 20-30% implied volatility (on robinhood, click on one of the near the money options and see what the implied volatility is).  I have recently had a lot of luck with tech stocks, especially AAPL.  MSFT, NVDA, and NFLX have also been good to me recently.

Your chances of making money will depend on how far out of the money your spread is.  When you sell an option on robinhood you can see the ""chance of profit"".  I generally try to stay in the 85% or even 90% area.  The farther out of the money you go the less premium you collect, but the greater the chances that the stock doesn't move against you.  I generally aim to collect premium of 3-6% of whatever I'm putting at risk.  So if I were putting $1000 at risk, I would want to collect $30-60 in premium.  (You can see here why the wins are small and the occasional loss can be big.)  If you are less risk averse than me you could go for smaller chance of profit but collect bigger premiums.

The width of your spread will determine your max loss.  I generally do $10 spreads ($1000 max loss).  I think of this as the amount that I'm investing.  If you want to ""invest"" more, it usually is better to make a wider spread rather than opening more contracts.  The wider your spread is, the more you can lose, but the farther the stock has to fall for you to experience max loss.  If you have 10 $1 spreads, or 1 $10 spread, your max loss is the same, but the stock has to fall a lot more in the latter case for you to experience max loss.

There are a lot of strategies for picking expiration date.  A popular one is to choose a date a month+ out, and then close it as soon as it has hit your profit target. This has the advantage that you can usually exit the trade without too much loss if you see it going against you.  I have currently just been selling high chance of profit spreads on weeklies and holding them until expiration. This is a bit more risky but has been more profitable so far.",alanwj,wallstreetbets,1.0

When I discovered those 3X ETFs, I thought it was too good to be true. In a way it was, because I didn't fully understand the ""volatility decay"" inherent to them, especially the bearish ones in a secular bull mkt. I lost 100s of thousands longing FAZ, ERY, DUST, and TZA. The bullish NUGT too when gold went bearish. Eventually learned my lesson.

The easiest trade was to short these 3x bears and also the great UVXY, but my broker never had shs available to short. That is why I had to rely on buying puts and selling call spreads on UVXY after any vol pop. I haven't been doing this for the past couple of yrs based on my worries of the eventual bear. We should be close. 
I tried to short XIV too and just missed (by a few months) its titanic downfall.


If I would have held FAS till April 2010, sold and paid my taxes, I would have walked away with over $10 mil.
Now, again dreaming, if I used that whole amount, and borrowed full margin at around 1% from IB, and put that in NFLX which I bought for an avg of $58 pre split in the fall of 2012, and had the balls to  ride it to post split price of $400, those two trades alone would have brought me to $1 billion pre tax. Wishful thinking, but amazing that I had an actual path to be a billionaire (post taxes if counting my SOXL trade made in Jan and Feb 2016).

2,2020-02-12,"Semi-DD on new positions:
I‚Äôm thinking both QQQ and MSFT could take a few days to consolidate before climbing again. Also thinking the overall climate is bullish but we have a few risk factors for short term setbacks in play so I don‚Äôt want to run weeklies right now.

I bought $4.7k of AAPL calls today (4x 3/20 $320c) at an average of $11.89 when they were slightly ITM. I feel AAPL has some catching up to do vs. MSFT or QQQ and it tends to grow more consistently than GOOG/FB/AMZN/NFLX. Thought about TSM and tech ETFs but chose to just get more AAPL. It then went on sale after the news on regulatory scrutiny (reviewing all big tech mergers?) and the galaxy $1000 pricing announcement so I‚Äôm down ~$600. Anyone who wants to join in, this looks like an easy long play became even easier with the discount. I plan to carry this call until it‚Äôs about a week from expiry and see what Tim brings me.

I also took ~$1k of positions each in SPCE and PCG. 3x 3/20 SPCE 20c @$3.60 and 10x 3/20 PCG 20c @$1.03. I‚Äôm currently flat on those taken together, up a bit on SPCE and down a bit on PCG. 

SPCE is an interesting meme stock with a lot of chatter on here. Because the space tourism business is one of a kind on public markets and Sir Branson is going to not only be the president but also a client, a lot of long term and LEAPS buyers are getting in so it‚Äôs not as pump-and-dump as for instance DEAC. To the moon!

PCG is a California utility company that is on track to escape bankruptcy so share prices have been increasing steadily. Their ATH was $71.57 in 2017, and they dropped to ~$45 through October 2018 when they were engrossed in a huge wildfire settlement that ultimately looked likely to drive them to bankruptcy. The all time low was $3.55 just back in October 2019 when bankruptcy looked imminent. There were a lot of swings as the government decided whether to burn them to the ground or not. They now have reached a final settlement on the wildfires that leaves them solvent, and the stock has been strongly appreciating since then. There have been quite a few quality DD posts on PCG here over the last few months and the general sentiment is bullish.",johntaylor37,wallstreetbets,2.0

The BABA 250 2-14 calls more than doubled

The AMD calls were about the same price this morning then down about 40% or so later in the day today.

The AAPL calls lost about 50% of their value overnight and now they are at the same price as yesterday and gained the back all the lost %.

The msft calls are down from where i posted them at yesterday, its hard to calculate as their was many different expirys and strikes. However the msft post i had 2 days ago - [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f1sufw/msft\_option\_flow\_tons\_of\_orders\_to\_see/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f1sufw/msft_option_flow_tons_of_orders_to_see/) Made a lot, its hard to calculate as their was many different expirys and strikes. Some doubled. It shows that the earlier you get into these the better you are off.

The SPCE calls went up its hard to calculate as their was many different expirys and strikes.

The snap calls fell in value

The nflx calls lost some of their value

I will say this, don't just enter into positions based on this data alone in most cases. Use technicals/fundamentals/options data-flow/market sediment all combined instead of just 1 of these.

On top of that, over half of them are here on H1B visas and don't have health insurance.  It probably won't go down completely, but expect an increase in outages and and a decrease in performance if enough people are out of work to increase NFLX subs.

First buy was NFLX, which did well last recession as the cheapest media source with the largest library.  They get negative press because of many players (like Disney) pulling their content from streaming.  But all those titles are still available on DVD.  If people get poor and do what they did before, NFLX is going to get a big boost in DVD subscriptions.  


The other buy is AMZN.  They have famously automated warehouses and deliver.  Everyone who is too scared to go shopping is going to finally learn to shop online for everything.  My friends in China are getting 100% delivery of everything, and if the outbreak continues to worsen here I expect the same.  Next quarter earnings will bear judgement on that call.  


The last part is that those companies are weakly represented in QQQ relative to my esteem of them.

Look, manufacturing companies are laying off thousands and oil companies are ready to declare bankruptcies. But AMZN is hiring more and NFLX is hardly affected.

I am rolling some of my SPY puts to IWM puts and going to focus on individual companies...

There's many other entities that have fallen 75-80% already so I do not expect then to fall with the market frankly. Hence it's not all equal.
I suggest people really try to seperate stocks. This might be a monumental money shift out of big tech overvaluation into depressed entities, all the while the indexes will bleed in general.
Retail, transportation, entertainment must be perused for survivors and bankruptcy candidates. It's not easy. Even I have a terribly hard time figuring out fair values.

This is why puts are dangerous. It's going to take months of that dormant, passive ""I DCA religiously"" money to work its way into the market to get the big dogs out. I keep hearkening back to '08. We hit a top in late '07, Bear went tits up and we traded a range until Lehman went tits up, then shit hit the fan. The smart money had months to get the hell out. 

The banks are completely skullfucked here. All kinds of places are going to have rent go unpaid for 2, maybe 3 months, minimum. The authorities won't enforce foreclosure or eviction laws. It takes time for that shit to work through to the banks. The banks need a ""guh"" earnings report for the bottom to really fall out of the market here and it ain't coming until after Q2. You'll get theta fucked on puts that long. 

Tech also seems pretty resilient and as MSFT, NFLX, AAPL, etc. have giant market caps, they might actually be able to somewhat contain hits the broader markets take because they constitute such a large percentage of the index by market cap.",Mail_Order_Lutefisk,wallstreetbets,0.0
1,2020-04-07,"That's right.  It's very stable throughout this.  That's why it'll have less upside when SPY rockets up, but it's also less stable on down moves.  Part of my thinking when I opened up a 2:3 call spread since I wanted to capture the upside vol as theta.

It's not alone.  Take a look at EA and ATVI.  Those are also almost back to where they are (albeit a bit less).  It's cause the three stay-at-home stocks are considered safer havens as stocks not affected by this virus.  You can assume NFLX has a high debt which can hurt them, but if this virus thing is short, it won't really affect him so the price pattern does make sense.

With that said, NQ will drive NFLX.  NQ goes down, NFLX should go down in most cases...not 100% though.",Randomness898,wallstreetbets,1.0
2,2020-04-06,"I placed 7 trades that were timed perfectly, I don‚Äôt believe the market conditions right now would allow me to do the same without extreme luck. Did 3 separate spy calls that got me from 1.1 to around 9k then focused on Tesla and Netflix. Played Tesla first two weeks before the earnings with my expiration date set a week after and took that 9k to around 40k. Again this was when Tesla was going mad crazy so every night I fully hedged my positions and lost out on over 400k from the moves leading up to tesla 900. Moved on to Netflix after I looked at their earnings and thought it was relatively positive so opened an ATM call credit spread expiring the day after the earnings (super risky since I thought they had a good call and guidance) but I got lucky and they tanked in the morning so i closed out my 40k call credit for max profits to take me up to 60k. Took that and placed it all in feb 17th 400 Netflix calls that dropped me down to 35k but I held on for another two days before nflx exploded from 325 to 365 and that position took me to 125k. From there i just opened more call credit spreads and withdrew 40k once it hit 165k. Again definitely got lucky with the first few plays but I‚Äôm in the industry so I had a better grasp at individual stocks. I think my trip from 8.8k to 105k in a week was more impressive since I actually daytraded about 75-100 trades everyday on spy but as the saying goes what goes up must come down and I got greedy and placed everything on spy puts expiring on March 27 and watched everything go to 0. Biggest lessons learnt are just stop letting your ego or bias control the position, cut losses earlier and roll them over to longer dates if you still have a bias.

As I said in the weekend thread from 4 days ago, I had MAR, UBER, LYFT, and CCL calls I got end of day last Friday as part of my weekly reversal trade (as well as AAL and LK shares)...but I got out of all of them middle of day yesterday except my AAL/LK shares (LK no way to get out of anyways).  Oh well, they still did really well this week (some like +500%), just coulda been even better with today's moves.

But now I reversed myself and am essentially short IWM (short call spreads), SPY (put spread), MCD (put spread), NFLX (short call spread), IQ (short calls), LYFT (now long put spread), SQ (short calls) and CLX (short stock).  IWM, SPY, and NFLX expire tomorrow, the other option positions expire next week, so I've turned myself into a bull into a semi-bear within the week.  I feel like I'm going to get screwed in IWM, SPY, and NFLX (with DIS news) for tomorrow, but it's fine, just trying out the bear experience.

I really think if you are looking for some good opportunities, if you can time the reversion again on stocks like CCL, MAR, UBER, LYFT, SHAK, SQ, etc. you can make a lot.  Like you can make 20x if you can time these right, way more than SPY.

At this point they either expand into different markets, charge more, or cut costs. Realistically they can only try international markets but in practice this is DIFFICULT because its not like selling a candy bar or soap which will be accepted in any society. They would need to make enormous investments to custom tailor their content to each market. Look into how miserably NFLX has done in India for example.

Here‚Äôs the problem though, streaming is way more competitive now with Disney, HBO, and basically everyone and their grandma trying to start a streaming service. This will keep NFLX from raising prices at a time when it NEEDS to raise a shit ton of money to continue making original content to stay competitive. I believe technicals echo the fundamentals: and so if you look at the chart you will see that NFLX continues to struggle in the high $300s. My bet is that it falls hard from here, starting with its upcoming earning report. Going down to the low $300s!!",ticktockmofo,wallstreetbets,1.0

The one big thing is NEVER DIAMOND HANDS, unless it's with spreads.  I never hold long calls or puts for more than a few days.  Yes, I could have potentially made much more, but at least I didn't lose it all. March was my most profitable month and I buy calls 90% of the time. I'm pretty sure that was because of my toilet paper hands. I usually start selling at 20-30% gain and sell more as it gains.
The second thing should be a no brainer but it's buy the trend.  It might be against intuition, but I'd more comfortable buying stocks at all-time highs than all-time lows. My most profitable plays were TSLA, NFLX, and NVDA calls after each broke their ATH this year.

So the idea here is longterm disney + might be worth 150B alone

Disney has been worth ~185B for a while now since 2015 and well before disney + idea even emerged

Parks will reopen and disney be disney they will continue to buy successful studios and licences and make movies and series. And of course they'll sell merchandising and make a killing

I don't like disney movies or shows but i know for a fact kids just keep asking to watch the movies, it's just stupid they'll watch the same disney movie like twenty times, so a dis+ sub makes a ton of sense for a lot of families.

6,2020-05-06,"I went back and forth on whether I would hold into earnings. I decided when I looked at NFLX. NFLX has a market cap of 190B. PTON is 10B. I held.

Life is going to be different in a few months. Firstly, businesses will want folks to work from home more because they don't need as much office space and they just gave money to MSFT so their employees can work from home. Secondly, employees will want to work from home. LA traffic is decent for the first time in decades. It's not a pain to get anywhere now. Who wouldn't want 2 hours per day of their life back?

PTON has such household name recognition now that it's the one to bet one. Exercise is going to be much more important now that more people realize how important it is to stay healthy. Second leading indicator of a bad time with covid-19 is obesity.

PTON is subscription based like netflix and once you have the bike and get used it riding a couple times a week, retention will be excellent. Walking around on a gym floor? Not for a long time and for some people not ever again. The total addressable market is way bigger than analysts give credit for. How many millions of folks attend a gym or a spin class?

I made $2700 a couple months ago selling a NFLX put when stock was $315. Had to sit through a couple of large drops after though before it rebounded. This is why I say only sell them for stocks you wouldn‚Äôt mind getting exercised on- it gives you the courage not to cover at a loss if the stock moves against you.

All that chatty stuff is being used (Zoom, Snapchat, Facebook) because in-person contact is riskier.  Netflix and Activision Blizzard are there for home entertainment.  And I'm too retarded to understand how cloud businesses like Microsoft, Twilio, Okta, and ServiceNow are benefiting from it, but I guess that's a thing too.

Bust - Here I think is the other side of the coin with all those companies I mentioned above.  Their entire bull run is predicated on growth growth growth (especially the ones that aren't profitable right now).  You see, the stay-at-homey economy has forced a handful of tech-averse holdouts to sign up for and use their services, essentially fast-forwarding their growth (the big boom).  Now with their growth fast-forwarded, they'll hit their total addressable market quicker, and there will be a flattening of their growth curve sooner as they have no new customers left to acquire.  See, COVID-19 forced the most old-fashioned get-off-my-lawn type of people to finally succumb to using their tech products and solutions - and those customers are the end of the line... the final hold-outs... the last remaining untapped market... there are no new customers left to acquire after them and nowhere left to grow bigly.  Added to that, when the economy re-opens, some of those old-fashioned customers may ditch the tech companies' services after essentially being ""forced"" to try them out and failing miserably with them (whether for business or personal use).

And with ""peak growth"" now hit (pussy-ass tiny growth doesn't count), Wall Street will realize that with not much growth left, they will actually have to value tech companies based on (GASP!) PROFITS now, and judge them as very over-valued on that basis.  And so they will turn on the tech stonks, the cloud stonks, and FAGMAN (FB, AMZN, GOOG, MSFT, AAPL, NFLX) since for them it's ""show good growth or GTFO"".  And since FAGMAN is a major market driver, it'll drag the market down with it.

TL;DR - Stonks only go up until FAGMAN and other cloud and tech hit a growth wall (which happens sooner rather than later due to Rona).  Then the music stops.  Also, I'm really fucking stupid, so don't listen to me.",VotedOut,wallstreetbets,1.0
2,2020-05-08,"[I did a post on HD/Lowe's](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g965yu/are_the_anecdotal_reports_of_huge_traffic_at_home/) a couple weeks back.


&gt;Tl;dr A lot of people have noticed the massive crowds at Home Depot and Lowe's of late.  This past weekend I did some Google Trends DD to see if that's really showing up numerically somewhere.  I found that HD and Lowe's are both at **all time highs** for search interest, with trends since February comparable to Corona plays like Netflix and Amazon, except more linear.  It's worth noting that unlike those stocks, HD and Lowe's haven't yet recovered or exceeded their pre-virus prices, although they have had a bit of a run-up today and Friday.


&gt;[Home Depot and Lowe's have seen a steady, sharp increase in search activity since March](https://i.imgur.com/1YAZ8zK.png).  In fact it appears to be an all-time high, even more than the holiday season.  And HD/Lowe's are pretty insulated from the Amazonification of shopping- a lot of their stuff is convenience based, or bulky items, or stuff you want to check out in person.

&gt;[Compare to the CV19 All-Star stocks Amazon and Netflix, along with Wal-Mart to compare to Amazon as a retailer](https://i.imgur.com/H1F4Kn7.png), there is a similar but more linear uptick for the home improvement stores.  And AMZN/NFLX/WMT stocks are at all-time highs.

&gt;[Etsy, Ebay, and Wayfair have seen upticks in search activity similar to the hardware/home improvement stores](https://i.imgur.com/lO7oop7.png).  (Side note, in contrast to these, Poshmark took a severe hit during the onset of the outbreak- used clothing not so hot during a virus outbreak I guess- although a recovery seems to be underway). However, their stocks have mostly already recovered their pre-corona prices.  Still some room to run possibly, if you think the landscape has permanently changed in their favor.  eBay especially has potential to challenge Amazon in online retail if they can get on the right track.

&gt;Just for comparison to Wayfair, HD, and Lowe's- [nobody much cares about Bed Bath and Beyond right now](https://i.imgur.com/wBXgwgt.png), which is just as well since their stores are closed. 

&gt;&gt;*4/28 addendum*: Actually as it turns out, BBBY released strong online sales increases and skyrocketed yesterday, and is now up about 30% since Friday.  On that note, there is a small uptick in the search activity for Bed Bath Beyond. That could represent growth in online sales. If so, as HD and Lowe‚Äôs have much larger upticks I wonder if that could also be pointing in part to strengthening online sales, which the markets seem to love.

&gt;Bottom line, the hardware/home improvement stores are tracking the hot internet stocks in terms of search interest and anecdotal feet through the doors, yet their valuations have lagged.  I wonder if the markets are overweighting the loss of construction business.  This could present an opportunity for HD/Lowe's to surprise at earnings, which is really what an earnings play is all about.

&gt;Positions: 

&gt;HD 6/19 220c, 245c

&gt;LOW 6/19 110c, 125c

2,2020-05-09,"Here instead of me writing out a bunch of shit check out Bert Hochfeld &amp; Beth Kindig's research. Can find on seek alpha or their websites... They do great tech research on this area of the market. 

So the reaction in these stocks is based in the narrative behind them. With software the name of the game is rule of 40. If your growth slows before you can be profitable its lights out. FEYE ZUO BOX CLDR DBX... The market gives &gt;30x sales values to some and 1x sales to others. BOX competes with the largest cloud providers &amp; has growth problems &amp; is not profitable. It's all over. The bet now is can they turn it around. 

TWLO is the exact opposite. People were worried organic growth was slowing &amp; they havent turned to total profitability yet. Last quarter the narrative changed when they beat &amp; raised by a huge margin. So the stock rushed higher because it was mispriced. When the narrative changes on something you get powerful moves like this. Just like TSLA. I think SQ is going to go through this but so does everyone. 

CRM is a value play in cloud. But directly related to retail so there's way more risk in CRM than all others. 

I wouldnt recommend something necessarily but if you model these $ESTC has the highest probability of pulling a TWLO IMO. A company with sustained 50% growth, 72% gross margins, 0% cash flow &amp; -20% op margins should be valued higher than 10x sales. CRWD will sustain 50% growth on 71% gross margins, 10% cash flow (but growing CF much faster than ESTC), ~ -10% op margins &amp; is valued at over 20x sales. TWLO trades at 17xish sales on 50ish% growth &amp; 50% gross msrgins at 1.6B scale. I could go on with the comparisons to similar growth rate &amp; gross margin companies RNG CRWD DDOG TWLO DT... Go do the DD, compare forward year growth rate, cash flow margin/op margin, gross margin with the multiple the market gives the stocks. 

The narrative on ESTC is that is an 'elastic' open source platform used mainly for observability (logging tracing APM API security) by big tech. NFLX Airbnb LYFT UBER all use ESTC infrastructure. At this moment ESTC ia going through a huge change &amp; this is why I believe ESTC has the highest probability of pulling a TWLO &amp; rallying to new highs. 

1. Sentiment on the stock is nonexistent due to its lack of stock performance, the CEO not going on CNBC, and the company not being widely known - its yet another fast growing software company, what do we do with it? What multiple do we assign? &gt;30x sales like DDOG? Or 10x sales which is like the penalty box for cloud multiples. The lack of sentiment could create a huge opportunity in future
2. ESTC leverages open source search to process raw NoSQL data, observe digital operations, etc. It recently acquired an endpoint security company that it has integrated into its stack FOR FREE. This competes in a huge market. The idea is to give away endpoint security to incentive buying the largest package from the company - you need to secure all endpoints so they argue security should be integrated into observability, in fact they basically say that logging &amp; security overlap entirely. 
3. They are suing AMZN for forking their code with stolen code. ESTC is big in the open source community &amp; the community seems to not tolerate code stealing. I'm not a programmer so Im not entirely sure whats going on but this could be positive for AMZN as customers move off AWS' copy of ESTC to ESTC. In fact ESTC seems to be giving away the security software to beed up their offering to get the conversion from AWS.
4. COVID likely will see demand for observability go up due to increase in online traffic. More people watch NFLX so theyre making more recommendations using ESTC. 
5. If ER May 20 proves that COVID benefits ESTC the narrative will change QUICKLY. People will start to dig at whats going on. If an analyst asks if they are taking from AWS then that will be in play. Likewise when the market realizes how they are positioned in cybersecurity it will add to the sentiment on the stock. When sentiment changes hedge funds buy and stock is adding un cloud ETFs. Passive investing starts buying and youre golden.

They‚Äôre not big wins, but if you‚Äôre consistent at 2%/week that compounds to 180% gains for the year. That makes the ‚Äúconservative 7%/yr‚Äù look completely foolish.

Close all other positions and stay in cash. Go to yahoo finance and add an RSI indicator to SPY, set the number of periods to 14 and price type to close. Set the price interval to 1 week. If you followed these steps correctly, you will see RSI is currently 48. Check this chart at least once a day, if that RSI number ever falls below 30, buy SPY or check the price on some of the most popular stocks like FB, MSFT, AAPL, CRM, etc. and go long on the index or a few stocks if they're down at least 30% from Feb highs. Next, hold on to that investment, do not sell no matter what happens and eventually you will see 50%+ returns. DO NOT TRADE ON MARGIN!

If $SIRI reacted to $SPOT news the way $NFLX reacted to $DIS news then I expect this drop to be not only temporary but a gift. I'm expecting $SIRI to rally up at the very least to $6 before stopping.

Why it can't go tits up: The Hang Seng just plummeted over 5% last night and the SPY was basically unaffected. The last time we saw such a disconnect the Hang Seng tanked while the US markets rallied to new highs. This ofcourse was followed by a devastating drop.

What this means is that the SPY should rally over at least the next 2 weeks which will put risk on like you won't believe, causing another crash later. Because there will be a major risk on environment companies like $SIRI that seem a little riskier will go into full bloom.

1,2020-06-04,"Yeah. I was doing that for a while with SPXL and SPXS too, but then SPXS stopped paying, so I went 2:1 SPXL:SPXS and 2:1 TNA:TZA. I just got strait up lazy with unhedged FAS, but banking never saw the rally the others did, and I don't see a reason why it would be any more prone to barfing than the others. Aside from the fact that I didn't bother to hedge it. So if it shits the bed, it's probably my fault. Sorry to anyone who was hoping for a financial sector rally in line with what we've seen in other sectors, I ruined it with my expectations.

My eyes are on TQQQ/SQQQ now to see what happens when bloated tech stocks get harvested (or if they get another big pump) and jumping into SPXx &amp; TNx with the expectation of a similar pattern playing out. I may buy a smaller position back into FAS after my trailing stop losses kick in, if the rally looks stable-ish. Based on beta, at least, banks should end up swinging harder than SPY. But if SPY swings down before banking gets there, banking is doing another hard down too.

I set a sell order and sleep. Well I sleep past open because I already lost upwards of $3k of my own dime this year due to market illiteracy. So I have stopped giving a shit. Well I set it too high and miss a nice 100% gain at open

With my genius wit I thought, oh, let‚Äôs save face. Sold for a $10 loss this morning. Well guess the fuck what, 2 contracts of MSFT $190p 6/12 is worth around $550 now.

Either this or you can find a stock that seems bullish and finds a hard bottom. 

Once you get that taken care of, also buy a contract a little further off for next week.

The answer is NO, they would not have collapsed as they did in February and March if they were not in a bubble. All it took was a catalyst and pop, valuations collapsed because they had no basis in reality.

We are in a tech bubble. Many companies being bid up to billions of dollars i.e. DKNG, NKLA have no revenue.

&gt;  
&gt;Well, global box office is only $42 billion/year, all together everything related to film globally is $136 billion. Hitting $1 trillion in market cap would be difficult when the $1 trillion market doesn't exist.

This all makes sense, although DIS has its finger in a lot more pies than just global box office.  The most recent being streaming, which made me wonder - what is global streaming total addressable market?

Well it turns out ONLY USD $42.60 billion (although technically not TAM but current market revenue)

What's my point?  Well NFLX has a market cap of USD $209.74B.

51,2020-07-06,"##It May Be A Long Wait For The Next $1 Trillion Dollar Company

&gt;Alphabet closed the week with a market value just above $1 trillion, making it the fourth member of the trillion-dollar club, along with Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon.com.

&gt;The group is likely to remain exclusive for a while. There's no obvious fifth candidate. Among U.S. companies, Facebook (ticker: FB) is next in line, but the social giant has a long way to go to reach trillion-dollar status. Its market value is $665 billion. The social network is currently under fire for how it polices content, but it has a mammoth global user base -- 3 billion people use Facebook, Instagram, or WhatsApp on a monthly basis -- that no other company can match.

&gt;After Facebook, though, there's no other U.S. company with a market value between $500 billion and $1 trillion. (There are two foreign stocks in that range. Alibaba (BABA) and Tencent (0700.Hong Kong) are both valued around $600 billion.)

&gt;There are two companies in the $400 billion range -- Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) and Visa (V) -- and three with a 3-handle -- Mastercard (MA), Walmart (WMT), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ).

&gt;There are 13 U.S. companies with valuations between $200 billion and $300 billion -- Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), UnitedHealth (UNH), Home Depot (HD), Intel (INTC), Nvidia (NVDA), Verizon Communications (VZ), Netflix (NFLX), AT&amp;T (T), Adobe (ADBE), PayPal (PYPL), Tesla (TSLA) and Walt Disney (DIS).

&gt;So which company is most likely to reach $1 trillion next? There's no easy answer. Most of the companies above $200 billion in market value are mature slower-growing businesses. They seem unlikely to double, triple or quadruple in size.

&gt;Here's how Barron's would handicap the race for the next trillion-dollar stock:

&gt;Tesla (TSLA): Already the most valuable car maker, Elon Musk's company has fundamentally changed what had been a slow-moving industry. To get to $1 trillion, Tesla's market cap would need to quintuple. To bet on Tesla to get there, you have to believe that Musk can substantially grow volumes, and maybe move into some large adjacent businesses, perhaps autonomous car hailing or robotic package delivery.

&gt;Walt Disney (DIS): Disney currently has plenty of issues. Theme parks? Closed. Sports? Shutdown. Movie production? Suspended. Traditional TV? On the wane. And yet, this is a company that has vast intellectual property assets and a knack for juicing them for decades. People are still watching Snow White, which debuted in 1938. At some point themes parks will open, sports will resume, and we'll head back to the movies. Some day, when Covid 19 is history, Disney could move to the front of the trillion-dollar race.

&gt;Disney/Netflix: One way Disney could get bigger in a hurry would be to team up with Netflix, adding the world's largest subscription-based video service to the Disney family. Simply combining the two companies would mean a market value over $400 billion.

&gt;Amazon Web Services/YouTube/Instagram: It's not impossible that the next trillion-dollar company could be buried inside an existing trillion-dollar company. If there's a complete regime change in Washington this fall, with Democrats taking not just the White House but also both houses of Congress, pressure to break up megacap tech companies could increase and spur structural change. The most obvious candidates for spinoffs are Amazon Web Services, the largest provider of cloud computing services; Alphabet's YouTube, by far the dominant player in ad-supported online video content; and Instagram, Facebook's hipper little sibling.

&gt;JPMorgan Chase: The country's largest bank has a prominent CEO in Jamie Dimon and a history of innovation. Could a financial services company reach $1 trillion? It's possible, though it might require a little sprinkling of M&amp;A magic to make it happen. The other obvious candidates from the financial services realm are Mastercard and Visa.

&gt;Wild Card: Could a pharma company soar to trillion-dollar status with a cure for Covid-19 or cancer or aging? Maybe. Could we see a shift in energy markets that drive oil companies back into the mix? Doubtful, but not impossible. Could another social networking player get there? Potentially, but it feels like a long shot. The venture backed company with the highest current valuation is China-base ByteDance, parent of the social media phenom TikTok. But it's not clear TikTok can ever reach Facebook's scale -- others have tried. Snap is worth just $34 billion, and Twitter, $24 billion.

&gt;Long shot pick: How about SpaceX? Elon Musk's other startup is already doing things in space travel that no private company has ever done. Musk's long- established goal is to get people to Mars. Or what if Tesla, which previously bought Solar City, decides to buy SpaceX, creating a transportation giant that can take you to the grocery store -- or to the end of the universe.",BlakeRidley,wallstreetbets,51.0

The strategy you describe has been working for me lately ‚Äî I tee up a 30 minute chart and compare to SPY in the AM @ 10:30 EST. Compare candles and look for divergence. Netted 3x on NFLX last week + 2x on BABA yesterday. All intraday.",mjd248,wallstreetbets,8.0
9,2020-07-10,ZM &amp; NFLX booming tomorrow,harryburton420,wallstreetbets,9.0
10,2020-07-10,"It depends.

First of all, if bid/ask is large, I'll stay out. No point enduring all the risk only to lose profits to bid/ask spread. BKNG, played once and will never touch it again.

&amp;#x200B;

Next, for stable or slow trending prices, I offer somewhere in between the two, sometimes even beyond if the price is moving in a direction I like. This is because I can afford to wait a whole day... even days to get my price.

Example is WMT yesterday, it was slowly bleeding downwards and I'm not too eager to get in. Offered \[Bid -0.5\] around noon, git executed a few hours later. It's an unplanned play I decided on the fly, so if I lose, I want to lose less... If it didn't get executed, it doesn't matter either.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, for price spike, with short time frames, I usually Buy at Ask or \[Ask+0.5\]. Reasoning is simple, I may lose 1.0 or 1.5 to the trade, but waiting may cause the price to rebound, which means I'll need to pay even more. 

Example is NFLX today. The price loitered around 496-498 for 5 minutes at 11am before going back up to 500 by 11:10am. In this case, if I waited and the price rebounded to 500, that'll be $3-$4 difference, or options being 2.0-3.0 more expensive.

In hindsight, I could get a better price at noon or later. But hindsight trading doesn't work at real time. Also, I don't have 8 monitor screens showing charts of everything on my watchlist, I only have a SPY chart at the corner of my screen for alerts of sudden price movements.",Lzerove,wallstreetbets,10.0

12,2020-07-09,"You don't buy in for earnings. You buy at the dip, with earnings in mind.

In practice, you write a list of possible future earning plays you want to participate. Put those on a watchlist, buy in when you see an opportunity. 

For example:

Today,  NFLX dropped below 500. This is a dip, buy in. Their earnings is somewhere next week. Make sure your DTE covered the earnings date.

AMD was at lows dipping below 50 late last month. I got 8/14 51c because AMD did not confirm their earning date yet... Sadly, I forgot to wear my titanium gauntlets and paper hands made me sell them today... now I have to hope for another dip before earnings...

Slowly working my way up. Got as low as 2400 Friday close, but I stopped trading BA and started following discord callouts and yesterday my account closed at 7k almost on the dot, and I have positions in BABA, NFLX and AMZN which are all gapping up, as well as MSFT and some others, but those 3 are the biggest ones, so maybe I'll get back to 10k. 

Luckily my all time can never show red because I no longer have enough money to deposit to bring the starting amount positive lol, and the only way I can think of to make that amount fast enough is through trading, and well, that just would bring my all time higher, so, yeah, I can literally never lose the 26k I'm up, only 7k of it at this point, maybe 10k if this gap up is real",kinglax,wallstreetbets,37.0
38,2020-07-09,"Most people here trade, not invest. 

I have an investment portfolio that I have been able to add to largely because I withdraw gains from trading, and I plan to hold onto my holdings in there for years and years. Things like AAPL, WMT, AMZN, TSLA, CHGG, PFE, GOOD, SRET, O, Altria, Home depot, msft, nflx, AMD, NVDA and so on. Got it up to 15k but got cocky and lost a fuckton on my trading account so sold some stock in order to withdraw money as I wasn't getting income from trading that week and was in the process of getting a mortgage and having to put the downpayment on a rental property so needed some cash in my pocket. 

Right now I have 8k in there but it looks like my AMZN, NFLX, BABA and NVDA calls are going to gap me up a good amount so I'll be able to withdraw this week and put some back in my long term investing portfolio. 

Also, I'm new to all this stuff, only started trading May 4th with $750, and have always put money into stock portfolios like $10 or 20 at a time and would use it like a savings to get up to like 1 or 2k that I would need for a work trip or tuition or some other major expense i knew was coming. I've had my life changed by what to me is a fuckton of money and apparently to some people on this board is nothing at all so, hey, all the people who have it so good that 10k would no longer be life changing to you, why dont you each just give ME 10k and I'll make sure it changes someone's life",kinglax,wallstreetbets,38.0

Well, that's okay. It happens in life. 

I'd start looking at industries that haven't absolutely mooned. 

Maybe even ones still hovering near March lows. 

Tbh, COVID stocks are probably a safe bet. Believe it or not, I think ZM has room to grow. NFLX, MSFT, AAPL.  All of these companies that will probably benefit from if we have another shutdown and need to pay for their virtual services. 

One industry that's still hit low is energy, specifically oil. 

If we don't shut down, that's definitely something to start watching.

SPCE, NFLX, ZS, AAPL to name a few.

Opening a covered call 1-2 strikes above current price, and buying 2-4 strikes above would have made me a lot more.

Not sure if that would be the case for dkng since it seems range bound and just as likely to trade flat by week‚Äôs end. It‚Äôs more about catching some upside during mid week movements.

Numbers are meaningless this time round as most are already ""priced in"". The price has soared too high for current valuation. What's important, is the BS they will sprout after reporting the numbers (AKA forward guidance)

If Netflix continue it's current trend of business doing subscription only, they are overvalued and the price will sink faster than titanic... subscription can only yield that much revenue. Even if we consider the ridiculous event where everyone in the world is a subscriber, they will still be capped.

However, if Netflix can come up with innovative ways to exploit their huge customer base, the stock has a chance to double or more. I personally believe that the biggest trump-card that Netflix hold, is their huge user base. As for how they make use of it, that's a problem they have to solve.

34,2020-07-11,"I haven't picked specific positions yet, but basically calls on half the expected move up by just before earnings with strike dates just after earnings (with the intend to close before earnings). I just need to determine about how far I think they'll move up by their earnings.

Here's what I see are different tiers:

Tier 1:

PTON - Gyms are getting fucked left and right and PTON is building a community of avid paying subscribers, plus just recently talked about reduced price treadmills and such, so they clearly understand the key is to now expand their base. Could be a huge disruptor in the space. And investors don't seem to think LULU's acquisition of Mirror will matter to this as it bounced back after the initial dip after that.

TWLO - I wish I had realized they owned SendGrid before their last ER or I'd have possibly gotten on that. Between Twilio and SendGrid, they're pretty well positioned in the cloud space.

NET - IMO one of the more heard-of cloud companies in recent years. Not sure if they're that sound financially, but so many people use them that I feel like they'll keep going up. Also how do you not invest in a company with ticker NET for fuck's sake?

FB - Tiktok r fuk, and Insta is implementing TikTok-like features to capitalize on it, which I just found out today. It also seems like they shook off the boycott pretty easily, which doesn't surprise me as someone running ads on there for some clients. Shit's getting expensive on there but I don't really have a choice, so I imagine many others are in the same boat.

SQ - SHOP is getting all the glory, but if SQ's online stores gets any sort of traction, they'll be mini-SHOP + merchant account + CashApp and whatever else they dip their toes into. They're being run like a company that wants to be the next mega-tech company.

CHGG (which your post reminded me of) - The shift of school to at-home makes this a no-brainer, and interesting to see them expand to other areas.

Tier 2:

UPWK - Clearly they've been benefiting from the pandemic and should continue being a strong play. My only concern is that I find it more of a platform for outsourcing overseas than locally, so I'm not sure people have had success there.

FVRR - Ditto.

SNAP - Also benefiting from TikTok being dickslapped, but I think they're more in danger of being overvalued. FB is at least profitable and has a high upside anyways.

SPOT - Seems to be becoming the destination for podcasts in addition to radio.

ZM - Has run up so much already, but is a household name and like CHGG, is a school at home play, and is becoming a staple to use within many different industries. But it's so damn high already.

Tier 3:

PINS - Don't know what to make of Pinterest long term, but social's pretty strong right now other than TWTR.

DDOG - May belong in a higher tier, I just don't know enough about them other than it's had strong movement being on the cloud train.

RNG - TWLO-lite. Heard something about them being in online video which could put them as a ZM competitor, but skeptical of their recent movement showing they're not really a strong play now. May have higher upside though given that so who knows.

DKNG - One of the only tech-ish stocks that's also a recovery stock at this point, and feels like a good time to play them as there are lots of possibilities of good news propelling it up.

WMT - This may sound silly, but if their + will be looking to snipe subscribers for at least shipping but likely other things down the road from AMZN, this could be their ticket back into the upper echelons, and they've not gone up THAT much from it. This could be like going back in time and playing NFLX was when they just introduced streaming, and no, obviously they're not YET dabbling into that, but in general them getting subscribers for anything could have them pivot into whatever they want. It's only in tier 3 because it's still a retail stock at a time when most retail is getting hammered. Less upside than pure tech.",SunriseSurprise,wallstreetbets,34.0

76,2020-07-11,"I have noticed that after these run-ups in certain stocks (NFLX, TSLA) too many WSB autists feel left out and fomo their whole account the next week into something extra retarded.  Just a friendly reminder as a lot of accounts have been wiped due to fomo during this rally, like way more than usual.  When you think everyone but you is getting rich, it is the time to be a little more careful.  Also, if a 1 or 2% drop will blow up your account, you MAY be over-leveraged.  Before the June 11th drop retards were bragging about quitting their hedges because they were a waste of money, and many regular posters here have not been heard from since then.  Hedging is real.  Full disclosure I'm down 38% all time.

I rode EPR up from 17 to 35 post COVID and bailed. Need to see that consumer spending recovery you mentioned to feel good about it again and jump back in.

Splashy AMC (their largest tenant) news could move the stock - with the Paramount decrees over, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see Disney, NFLX or AMZN purchase AMC after the debt restructuring their currently engaged in.

One of those streamers will lead the way in unifying the home and theater experience to juice subscription fees. As an investor I‚Äôd feel a lot better about AMZN as a tenant than AMC.",deathofsadsack,wallstreetbets,81.0

Doubling the subscription price to see 2 or 3 more movies when the current subscription gives access to thousands? And the current AMC monthly pass is what - $20/month? So NFLX is gonna cut that nearly in half ($25 - $13 current Netflix subscription = $12) and make more money at it than AMC did? Or they're going to somehow get far larger numbers of people to sign up for it than AMC did? I just don't see enough growth in it year over year.,RecklesslyPessmystic,wallstreetbets,100.0

All these stocks I have other positions on them as hedges, so I actually had much less loss, but still, it is better to learn from mistakes and make fewer mistakes. Now I know that growth and rebound stocks are to be avoided for short calls. Technicals, fundamentals, and broad market sentiments are to be considered before making any trade decisions.

Short call AMD at $85 is not necessarily a bad idea; it is bad though that you have to liquidate the position to meet the margin call. I personally would have no more than 50% on short calls/puts. Sometimes I would have maybe 80%, but only because 40% are old positions just a few days before expiring and they are deep OTM.

1,2020-08-07,"So much hate.  No reason to have a chip on your shoulder. Let your returns speak for themselves. I decided to actively start managing my investments end of May. Prior to that I had all of my investments in a low cost S&amp;P 500 Index at Vanguard which is one of my three benchmarks plus Dow and Nasdaq. I am up about 27.5% in 9 weeks. 

 I am constantly refining my strategy and actively researching companies and current news.  It is all about the time investment. I had a good foundation of understanding financials from my day job and Undergrad/MBA. If you are unwilling to invest the time then Index Funds are a good alternative. No one is getting rich on the passive Index funds. The other big issue is risk.  How much are you willing to take for the rate of return you will get? Goal is max return with minimal risk. Many people don't have the discipline to invest/trade without it getting out of control.  Rational decision making is critical.

I am invested in AAPL, MSFT, FB, CRSP, AMZN, ADBE, NVDA, AMD as more long term bets.  I also have invested in TSLA, CWH, SONO, ROKU, PTON, NFLX etc. You have reevaluate your positions and periodically sell investments.  I have sold too early and stayed in too long multiple times.

That said I deal with similar issues. I've made decent money from the market. I spend ridiculous amounts of time scouring tickers and am extremely selective on my trade setups that I execute with heavy size. I'll never forget two specific options trades from a couple years back with BIDU and NFLX. On both, I was waiting for them to drop a couple more bucks before buying a crapton of leaps. But they never filled and that was the absolute bottom before they skyrocketed. Easy miss on 10s of thousands if not 100k+ trades.

Your problem is your money defines you. So when you have less of it you feel less inside your soul. I've been there. Your purpose is not in money though. You need to find it elsewhere in God, people, charity and giving. You will always miss out on huge trades. You will always want more.

15,2020-09-01,"Daily Market and Options Summary for Sept 1st, 2020

Daily Synopsis

* The S&amp;P 500 (+0.8%) and Nasdaq Composite (+1.4%) rallied to fresh record highs on Tuesday, with the Nasdaq getting an added boost from the momentum in the mega-caps and growth stocks. The wealth spread around to the Russell 2000 (+1.1%) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+0.8%), too.
* Today's key moves were Apple (AAPL 134.18, +5.14, +4.0%) rising 4% after JPMorgan raised its price target on the stock to $150 from $115, and Zoom Video (ZM 457.69, +132.59, +40.8%) surging 40% after it crushed Q2 earnings expectations.
* Apple was a major factor in today's index gains given its 7.3% weight in the S&amp;P 500, while Zoom provided the fuel for other growth stocks like Netflix (NFLX 556.55, +26.99, +5.1%) and DocuSign (DOCU 268.80, +45.80, +20.5%). Another supporting factor was the ISM Manufacturing Index for August increasing to 56.0% (consensus 54.5%) from 54.2% in July.
* The manufacturing data helped lift the S&amp;P 500 materials (+2.8%) and industrials (+1.0%) sectors into positive territory with the information technology (+1.9%), communication services (+1.0%), and consumer discretionary (+1.1%) sectors. Each advanced at least 1.0%.
* Conversely, the utilities (-1.1%), health care (-1.0%), and energy (-0.9%) sectors underperformed and declined around 1.0%.
* Recapping some other mega-cap moves, Walmart (WMT 147.59, +8.74, +6.3%) climbed 6% after officially introducing its Walmart+ membership program. Tesla (TSLA 475.05, -23.27, -4.7%), however, was a notable holdout after the company disclosed plans to sell up to $5 billion in stock.
* U.S. Treasuries ended the day higher after reclaiming overnight losses. The 2-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.11%, and the 10-yr yield declined two basis points to 0.67%. The U.S. Dollar Index increased 0.2% to 92.34 after being down 0.4% in the morning. WTI crude futures increased 0.3%, or $0.14, to $42.76/bbl.
* Looking ahead, investors will receive the ADP Employment Change Report for August, the Fed's Beige Book, Factory Orders for July, and the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index, and auto and truck sales for August on Wednesday.

18,2020-09-01,"PTON has plenty of room to run. They are going to crush earnings.

Even after significantly ramping up manufacturing over the past few months, they are struggling to keep up with demand. Every basic suburban white girl has been waiting by the front door for 4-8weeks for their bike to arrive so they can join their friends online. Products require a monthly subscription, and of course, their standalone app allows for users to subscribe without even owning a physical peloton product. Talk about sweet, sweet recurring revenue, allowing PTON to be viewed in a similar light as technology companies like NFLX, ZM, etc.

All of this demand comes before Peloton has launched their ""cheaper"" products to expand beyond the high-end market.

Still had student loan. So yeah it was fucking depressing. But having my family and my gf No way I could stay depressed and have these lingering suicidal thoughts. Looking back it‚Äôs so ridiculous how such small amt of money can influence my emotions. But when u don‚Äôt have a lot, that really can feel like the world to you. 

So to fight these depressing emotions, I just kept myself super busy. I freaking worked like 60+ hours a week for a yr. Since I became antisocial and lost appetite, I saved decent money. Eventually suicidal thoughts went away. The thing is U never truly get over these losses imo. Only way to do that would be to make ur money back from the market. You can get back to that anytime when u r in a more stable situation in ur life. But for now, just focus on ur daily routines of life and enjoy some fresh air",omfgnothingworks,wallstreetbets,33.0

Go to a 2 year chart and add SPY, NFLX, AAPL, GOOG, AMZN and then TSLA.  TESLA is a freaking straight up arrow.  Its growing too fast.  Its going to come down - companies that  make 500 million a year will not be a trillion dollar valuation.

Palantir?! You  ought to ask yourself some hard questions about why that appealed you. It sure wasn't their financials. In addition to never coming close to making money, their growth is shit. Oh, and they have a small customer base, the details of which they didn't disclose. So what was it? Was it the ""mystery"" around them? The vaguely sinister vibe? What caused you to think it was worth risking money on?

&gt;With more than 8,100 stores worldwide, Blockbuster is repositioning its business to respond to a changing marketplace that is embracing DVD and video game sales and moving away from old-fashioned VHS rentals.

&gt;**The desire to stay at home, which increased post 9/11**, and the pursuit of inexpensive entertainment in a weak economy are two long-term trends fueling demand for DVDs and video games, say some analysts and fund managers. This bodes well for Blockbuster, the world's largest video rental chain.

|2019	 |$12,417  ||

In many cases, you could have done better selling early, like with the crazy $NFLX 510's last week. They bought the 510's on Wednesday between 1.13 and 4.35, and you could have sold them Thursday for 20.00, but they expired worthless on Friday. My system is too simplistic to catch that and just records the loss.

Often most of the gains to be made have been made by the time they announce. There is often a bump toward EOD, but there's often a big decline over the next few days. For the winners, it's not uncommon for them to bounce back from a big loss. The 09Oct AMD 85's from last Thursday are sort of following that pattern. Six to nine months  into my following this, they finally started talking about exit strategies, e.g. dumping at 50% decline, but that would certainly kill some big winners, and I don't know how effective it is.

5,2020-11-02,"LHX. This is an amazing company, the 6th largest company in Aerospace/Defense, that is a better engineering innovator than Lockheed or Raytheon. Unlike those companies, it's generally on time, on budget and successful at delivering on contracts. Consistently makes money and beats earnings. As a growth stock in the sector, it even had good dividends (but not as good as Lockheed's) It was gaining on the top 3 companies in January just before coronavirus. 

It was a sure thing, when coronavirus hit. [Even up to Sept 30, it was on Goldman Sachs' conviction buy list.](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3162976&amp;headline=LHX-LHarris-downgraded-to-Buy-from-Conviction-Buy-at-Goldman-Sachs) But nothing. People are refusing to buy it. So eventually, by around mid-October, it's become officially a Sell, for no reason except no one would buy it. It's now sagging back to about March lows, even tho it's a better aerospace/defense company on fundamentals than Lockheed, Boeing, and Raytheon. I'm watching aerospace companies that have jack shit for potential in the near and long term get lots of speculative money, while L3 Harris just dies on the board every day.

As far as I can tell, it's all because of retail investor rejection and momentum trading following retail investor pop stocks. It's hard for an industry outsider to figure out what the company does (which includes designing and managing the country's entire air traffic control and navigation system and a lot of other civil aviation). Actually, this stock is what led me to recognize the damaging impact of retail investor bubbles on US industrial companies. Right now, capital investment is at the mercy of retail investors, mostly kids, who have no idea about the stocks they're buying and selling. It's turned the market into something like Instagram, where meme stocks are recognized and traded based on their meme capital and not on anything else, really, like value, importance, earnings and market fundamentals. L3 Harris is full of uncommunicative dorks, apparently, and it's hard to figure out what the company does from its shitty, cheap website (whereas the other top defense contractors have cool, dynamic websites designed to pull people who have played video games and distract from the fact that they specialize 100% in killing machines). 

At one point (before I realized that the investing now is dominated by millennials and their meme stocks) I had $80K in LHX, waiting for it to, at minimum, recover the 30-40% of value it should have. I lost about 10% before I realized that right now, the stock market is like social media, where kids have to like it for something to exist. 

Finally, I broke and in tears sold it all off. Now I'm waiting for the US meat economy to go onto its last legs and die, plunging us into a deep economic depression, as real companies starve of capital, shrivel up and die while most of the country's capital investment pours into NVDA, NFLX, AAPL, FB, TSLA and other memes recognizable by children. I cut all my other US industrial and infrastructure investments at the same time, and have watched them continue to go downhill while people frantically plow money into the bubble stocks trying to prop them up for no actual reason that makes any sense, since they can sell them and invest in companies that haven't legs left in their recovery instead of sitting in a bubble. So I'm sitting here, watching the retail investors destroy America's capital investment flows to real meat world industries to throw too much, and unneeded, capital investment at things they recognize without a lot of effort.

2,2020-11-07,"That's kinda the reason I laugh at people telling 20-year olds with like 5k to invest to ""buy a bunch of etfs and forget"".

If your ETF goes for 10% a year (which is already generous)  and you don't touch that money for 10 years your account will be worth 13k.

So you made 8k dollars in 10 years.

If you have small sums it's better to try and invest into some speculative stocks for example. At worst you lose what? 5k? At best you might hit something like TSLA/NIO or something that grows like AMZN/NFLX and your 5k could be worth 50k in 10 years.

Unless you have big accounts (100k+) I actually encourage people to take higher risks for a higher reward. Not dropping 30k in SPY weeklies, but actually buying speculative stocks or leaps on good companies.",DrixGod,wallstreetbets,2.0

What lot of people failed to see from Mulan was that it was a premium service on dis+ meaning people had to pay extra $30 to watch it.

8,2020-12-08,"Interesting comment on mechanics of $TSLA price


Musk doesn‚Äôt *really* believe that though. Trust people‚Äôs actions, not their words. If Musk really thought the stock was that overvalued, *they‚Äôd be selling it like crazy*. 

Sure they‚Äôve done some small at the markets offerings, but they *really* ought to be cranking it up. They should be selling shares hand-over-fist to raise $100B or $200B (or more?) to create a cash pile so dominant that no car company could ever dream of matching it - then dump it all into R&amp;D. By comparison Volkswagen (who a lot of people say has EV tech that‚Äôs not far behind TSLA) has about $20B in cash on hand (similar to Ford and gm) and Toyota has about $50B. 

The reason TSLA isn‚Äôt raising tho is not bc the shares are overvalued (which is a question of fundamentals) - it‚Äôs because incremental demand for TSLA shares is *extremely* thin (which is a market/technical reason). Basically, there‚Äôs a (relatively small) pool of buyers that are willing hold TSLA but don‚Äôt have the money to add to positions in any depth. So TSLA isn‚Äôt de facto overvalued (there‚Äôs healthy demand for shares at current prices - this is the definition of ‚Äòfairly valued‚Äô), but there aren‚Äôt enough people with money that would be willing to add $$ in size at the current valuation. 

This isn‚Äôt really a ‚Äòmeme stock‚Äô issue, and this can happen for a looooooong time before it blows up - WeWork ran ahead of it fundamentals for ~8yrs and NFLX has run ahead for about 12 yrs.

TSLA is a *fantastic* example of ‚Äòif you don‚Äôt have the timing, you don‚Äôt have the trade.‚Äô The question about TSLA *is not* ‚Äúare shares overvalued? what do the fundamentals tell me?‚Äù (Nothing - TSLAs fundamentals are fucking shit compared to every other major automotive manufacturer and they aren‚Äôt materially improving). The question is ‚Äúwhen will their pool of dedicated investors start to shrink and start to incrementally shrink marginal exposure?‚Äù Answering that gives you the timing. 

TLDR: Musk doesn‚Äôt think his shares are overvalued. He *knows* his investor base is incredibly thin compared to his mkt cap. 

Side note: TSLA being added to the SP500/SPY is a fucking *MASSIVE* ‚Äòliquidity event‚Äô. That means that you have directed and motivated buyers for a single-point event. There is no fucking excuse for not issuing a shitload of shares into that event - like TSLA should have issued-out ALL the needed shares. The fact that they haven‚Äôt done that (and don‚Äôt appear to be willing to do so) is one of the most fundamentally dumb things that company has ever done.  Wall St doesn‚Äôt give a lot of free shots on goal, and TSLA is failing to capitalize on a *massive* free at-the-market issue offer. Just dumb. If 10yrs from now, the other EV manufacturers catch up w TSLA, the failure of TSLA to do the financial basics correctly are going to be a Harvard Business School case",the13thrabbit,wallstreetbets,8.0

5,2020-12-09,"I‚Äôm not smarter than anybody - I‚Äôve just been doing this a while. 

To a takeout: super slim odds unless this Cohen guy is just fucking dumb. To buy the company next week, it‚Äôd cost about $1.25B to $1.4B all in. Cohen might just write a check but that appears that would be (more than) all of his money. So he has to finance it. 

Now this is an area I know *really* well. In this market and this space, creditors would only loan a small amount (say ~$800m vs $600M of equity) bc this is a dying retailer, in a dying space (mall retail), that isn‚Äôt flowing cash (for now), and when it does flow cash it‚Äôs not a ton (low margin business and margins are going the wrong way)....I can keep going. You just can‚Äôt arrange financing like that right now. If you could, you wouldn‚Äôt see all these retailers being pushed into Ch11 and ch7 bc they could just refi way out past coronavirus - but they can‚Äôt. 

Imagine if that was a person (low-paying, shitty job in a bad field, no transferable skills and their employer is publicly saying ‚Äòwe are gonna lay off a ton of ppl‚Äô) - would you loan that person a *HUGE* sum of money? Of course not, and neither would a person like me (or a bank).

Add to that, cohens strategy: throwaway all the physical and intangible assets in an effort to go purely online. Well, those assets were gonna be the stuff that secures the debt.....but he wants to throw it away. So I can‚Äôt really imagine a leveraged deal structure that works here. Bad strategy for a takeover bid. 

In the end, all these retailers end up getting liquidated and the only ‚Äòvalue‚Äô in the end (besides inventories and stuff) are the brand names. There been a pretty active market for legacy brand names; Ascena just sold a bunch in Ch7 a few weeks back. I‚Äôd bet that ‚ÄòGamestop‚Äô is worth $30M *TOPS* and probably less. 

That name is the core legacy asset, particularly if the strategy is ‚Äògo pure online‚Äô. So the question is, why would Cohen spend a huge sum of money ($1.2B to $1.4B depending) to buy an asset worth $30M? Maybe if and only if he‚Äôs fucking insane - but that‚Äôs not a great long thesis. 

And lastly to his thesis: Cohen is absolutely right that the future of gaming is strictly digital. He‚Äôs also retarded if he thinks a legacy mall-based retailer can develop that platform. Reddit loves to post ‚ÄòTIL Blockbuster turned down the oppy to buy NFLX for $50M in 2003 - lolololol they were dumb.‚Äô This is always a dumb take bc *blockbuster would have straight up killed netflix* - probably on accident or via innocent incompetence - but they would have killed it. And they would have killed it bc physical retailers CANNOT run a cutting edge tech platform. I can‚Äôt even think of a legacy retailer that‚Äôs developed a strong tech platform; not even Walmart and they have more cash than god. It just doesn‚Äôt work that way. 

If Cohen wants to find the next big thing, put $1B into developing the platform and buy the ‚Äògamestop‚Äô name out of bankruptcy.",Laminar_flo,wallstreetbets,5.0

I've done the correct calls a few times now with my only mistakes being selling too early. (Sold \~$20K of Tesla calls at \~$500 after buying them at $400).

For Disney, I think you shouldn't sell too early. I honestly think this is the start of a new rerating for Disney shares in terms of sales and EPS multiples (see NFLX).

If you really want to take profits in a few weeks/months, I recommend selling your cost basis and letting the rest run if possible (might be hard with just three calls).",ListerineInMyPeehole,wallstreetbets,5.0

My issues here are GME specific: 1st time activist w an *insane* thesis that can‚Äôt be conventionally funded sitting w a coinvestment table that won‚Äôt support the thesis. Remember that making money isn‚Äôt about what‚Äôs *possible* - it‚Äôs about (probability x return). Again it‚Äôs possible that the giants win the super bowl, but you‚Äôre not betting that bc you know that (probability x return) is shit. 

Is it possible that Cohen gets a seat on the board? Sure. But the next 18-24mo of GME are FAR more likely to be a vanilla old-retail turnaround story (eg stronger aggregate cash flow % on a smaller asset base) as opposed to a wild ‚Äòblow it all up‚Äô story, and if it *does* turn into a ‚Äòblow it up‚Äô story, the stock isn‚Äôt going UP in the near term. 

On the surface, I‚Äôm unlikely to put in debt anywhere into that cap structure bc it just looks obviously wrong to me. But again, equities aren‚Äôt my space. On the credit side, I‚Äôve avoided both NFLX and TSLA - so far I‚Äôve been (happily) wrong on both. I may well be wrong on a hypothetical GME, but I don‚Äôt care bc I‚Äôd rather make money where I have a much higher degree of confidence in risk valuations.",Laminar_flo,wallstreetbets,13.0
