1,2018-05-03,"I wanted to write on here a story of success I have had when focusing on limited risk/profit, high probability trades. Just a little contrast to the lunacy on this page. I LOVE the faggots here on WSB, fav sub ever, but I can’t live up to the nuts you guys have.  So I wanted to report in on a little research I have been doing.  Please forgive the long post, its as short as I can make it as I am passionate as fuck about my experience.

Around a few months ago I decided to get in on options.  I heard here and there that options offer a high level of control and choice for the buyer. I have done crypto but was super frustrating with not being able to utilize trading analysis *at all*.  Made some money due to pure timing in crypto and of course at the beginning of the year everything changed.  The fun was gone, every move meant you came out negative at the end of the day because of the stupid fluctuation. Crypto was not worth the mental mortgage I was paying and it ceased to be fun trading.  I decided I was gonna make the switch over to learning options and put myself at study for a few months and see how it came out.  I wasn’t even aware that options had expirations or anything.  I did have a TOS account for just buying straight long stock. Haha.  Thank God for TOS and being able to call into an educated american 24/7.

I got good direction on Reddit and watched tons of youtube option intro videos...ultimately coming across a series of videos that was done pretty well and explained clearly...done by Sky View Trading.  Let me just be very clear, I am in no way a paid shill for these guys and their work, I actually joined their membership…..but let me just say that their service is so freaking awesome and interactive.  They have a full catalog of teaching videos, daily trade videos, email support, “official” trade alerts when they place them so you can just copy them exactly if you want.  Also a very active chat room during hours that is manned by a killer guy, Cristos, so you can post your ideas for trade and they give you feedback on the trade before you place it.  They NEVER say change your spread or anything, they more explain why you should change strike selection, what delta you look for, iv and other components.  They teach militantly, not deviating from the education material in their videos at all, won’t even discuss outside of their rules.  This is one of the reasons I love options and at the end of the day with backtesting and everything across multiple programs I have learned that when played like a fucking robot you will see a 92% win rate.  It’s when you get that human element added….and sentiment driven activity that your advantages are stripped.  The lovely Faggots Delight ought not be uttered.

I do also use TastyTrade resources and listen to their podcasts every day, at a minimum Last Call.  Seems like the teachings there are kind of in the same lane.
Sky View has taught me about “multiple concurrent single contract high probability premium selling options spreads, mostly Iron Condors, done on average 45 DTE outside of earnings with high liquidity tickers managed at 40-50% of max profit”.  Sound confusing, it is at first but ask me and I can explain further if you like.

Looks like i placed my first Iron Condor on Feb 25th and every trade that I have closed is listed in the pic along with various statistics I track to analyze myself.  I have been adding IV along with this stats moving forward.  I have tried to be a robot about it, play the rules and see if it is possible to outperform the market.  If I could put my time into something that isn’t a guess or doesn’t worry about directional movement overall. Also something I could scale.  Well as a complete noob, I am up from being able to have like 6 positions on at a time. Right now I have 15 open trades with expirations through June that I completely put together myself and money left over for opportunity buys.  I have achieved 13/14 wins and the one I did lose I didn’t follow the rules about position sizing because TSLA and Elon’s fat dong….so totally human error on my part, lesson learned.  Also if you look closely you will see a couple wild Faggot’s Delights on there, what can I say, I love the feel of it.  I should NOT be doing them as I am trying to be in a test environment.  I need to stop.

My plan is to cancel Skyview this month, do this for another year to prove it to myself and figure out how to scale this bitch.

If you are curious at all, please feel free to ask me whatever and I would be happy to discuss or point you to the correct resources.  I’m very excited and hope this reaches at least one other option noob.

2,2018-05-06,"True true my man if this was a true analysis I would be negligent in not bringing up assignment.  Most of what I am talking about is closing as soon as possible and what it takes to give you the odds to get there. 
I agree about looking longer.  Check my post from a couple days ago about selling 45 DTE Iron Condors.  I posted my results from my first full cycle.  Some good discussion on just that. ",spgvideo,wallstreetbets,2.0
3,2018-05-06,"The example shown in the picture is an example of what I will be discussing here.  NVDA earnings play selling Vertical Puts.  Max profit per contract $112, max loss $138.  My breakeven is $3 under the current stock price *and* I’m bullish.  Seems to good to be true.  So here’s the story:

Usually Im a staunch 45 DTE Iron Condor outside of earnings guy.  I’m learning how to stack the odds massively in my favor...hopefully.
But due to the fervor around this time of year, and the love for earnings in my fav sub evar, Ive been looking at earnings plays lately.  I've done like 5 in the last few weeks, all W’s.  I’ve only done the true YOLO no covered option call once.  The rest I have sold vertical put spreads but still in the weeklies. I try to get it in on Monday.  YOLOs are looking less and less like the way to go if you are looking for good consistent profits and covering yourself from decimating losses. Now i’m in testing phase so Im betting 1-2 contracts at a time, all referenced bets will be referring to single contract numbers.  If you want to scale just bump up the amount of contracts and the theory holds true.  To be clear, I am posting here to have you poke holes in my theories, give me reasons to NOT bet earnings after you read through my observations.

For example my one YOLO FD was on SQ last week.  SQ $43 call for $500.  I risked $500 for undefined max profit.  Could be a real huge winner, right?  Well as my analysis for the week went on and on, I realized I would have to have a unicorn runup to actually get respecible tendies.  That huge jump needed seems to come very very seldom.  I made $115 risking $500 and the stock def went up.  Seems like a lousy return on a high premium for such a “guess bet” but hey it was a W so good by me.  They amount underlying on SQ would have to go up to really make it worth it was kinda ridiculous.

*Good things about YOLO* - you can have unlimited profit potential and it also means you are a man of large juevos or a woman of large jugs.

Now I’d like to take a second to talk about what my favs have been, selling Vertical Put Spreads.  I guess I sell vertical put spreads b/c I bet on what I’m bullish on and this is the way I was able to build a trade that does just what I was looking for.  A few reasons I like these...you get the benefits of IV Crush which can certainly bump you up a couple ticks once earnings occur. FD folks are understandably grouchy about IV crush.  Put Spreads takes much less capital to cover the position.  Basically you are only waiting for the underlying price to be right above or below your break even….after that you are max loss or max profit like instantly.  Well to be fair I’ve gotten out at 90%, 63%, 85% and 76% of max profit.  This is me just almost instantly at open closing the position and taking the profit.  If you really wanted to hold until exp I’m sure you could 98% this method but with less chance of taking a profit. Not me.

For example a couple of my earnings plays that were selling covered put spreads.  Now these are already at the money or in the money for the break even:

MA Earnings last week. Selling Vertical Put spread 2 contracts.  $238 max profit, $262 max loss.  Came out with $214 profit which is 90% of max profit.

AMZN earnings 2 weeks ago. Selling Vertical Put spread 1 contract.  $377 max profit, 366 max loss.  Come out with $311 which is 85%.

I mean these aren’t knock it out of the park tendies but WSB doesn’t do single contract now do they?  Just expand to as many contracts as you want!  I feel like it is MUCH easier to get significantly higher profit much quicker than FD yolos while risking less capital.  Prove me wrong 

If you are interested in how I pick what earnings to play, I literally look at the most anticipated earnings threads on wsb, options and investing.  I’ll take hours to look at peoples comments and mark down the tickers that have the most positive sentiment.  Then I look at the tickers, the 1 year chart to see if we have a dip or ATH, the liquidity (bid/ask spread), I check analyst sites for technicals that I don’t fully understand yet.  Then from that list of 40 earnings or whatever I pick the 3 or 4 that seem like an overwhelming bullish prospect.  Set up the trades in TOS on Sunday, save em and wait for the bell.  Wish I could do more analysis but I already spend a ton of time studying Iron Condors so this is like my guilty pleasure.  Then I do have to go outside ya know.

I would post this over at r/investing or r/options but I like the humor here and when you read between the lines there are plenty of people who have valuable opinions, you just have to do the research to ensure they aren’t trolling you, which I have been plenty times.

even with options that have a lot of time left, being deeper ITM will have the same effect, but perhaps to a lesser degree. so options that are deep ITM will tend to vary in price to a lesser extent from a given change in the underlying price day to day than options that are ATM or slightly OTM with the same number of DTE.

0,2018-07-05,"&gt;  Am I limiting my upside too much by writing calls so close to the market price? Am I leaving money on the table by selling calls with under one week expiry?

Ya, sometimes. 

Like all option trades, but especially covered calls (""CCs""), a trader can do better when strategy is flexible and if they can manage a position. Should be obvious but all this talk of which deltas and DTE are best to sell are stupid - GTFO with that ""30 delta 50 DTE"" recommendations I see in other comments - there is no best. 

One needs to look at the option chain, look at the stock price and company news, look at the market beta and more, then decide which CC looks good to sell based on multiple factors. After the trade is on, then manage it as needed (such as by rolling up or down as conditions change).

Some rules of thumb that aren't retarded: it's better to sell the most expensivest shit (meaning *relative* IV expensive) and it often saves $ in the long run to close or roll than be assigned (this is more the case when there's fees, I'm guessing Robinhood doesn't charge for assignment) and a sold option expiring worthless is the cheapest way to do it so aim to get as close as possible to that price without going over, Bob.

For example: in the case of MSFT. MSFT has a dividend schedule and earnings schedule to trade around. If a trader expects a run up in stock price ahead of a dividend then maybe sell the expiration after the ex-dividend date or adjust the strike sold to avoid it going ITM. If a trader expects a run up in option IV or vega prior to earnings then maybe don't sell those cheap options as they just gona get more expensive and harder to manage and close. 

Also don't forget one can turn CC's into costless collars or call spreads too, as I'm sure you know. For example you sell a CC and then you start to worry about a market drop or just the stock correcting down after a good run up. One can take the premium from a call sold and use that $ to buy a put (aka costless collar - this protection and trade is ""free""). Example with made up prices: 

*MSFT shoots up to $102. $102 feels rich. Sell the 105 call strike for $1 and buy the 98 putfor $1. This trade didn't cost anything. The upside is capped above 105 but the trader bought free downside protection if the price drops back under 98.*

Likewise if someone sold a covered call and based on later research decides good news might be coming (maybe acquisition potential soon) and the stock could gap up, take some of call premium sold and use it to buy a cheaper OTM call (turning the trade into a bullish call vertical) - that way the person doesn't miss out on gains if the stock does a big up happy day. If one is selling covered call on a potential takeover/acquisition target type of company, something like: Selling the covered call for $1 and maybe buying a deep OTM call for 10 cents just in case can make dollars and sense. 

There's no easy answer. Gota be checking things like news, IV, VIX and calendar events and recent price momentum and then still get lucky.

0,2018-09-03,I've heard you want to go 30-45 DTE if you're selling premium. And/or pick a stock with more volatility. The short timespan and low volatility is why you don't get much credit,Nexic,wallstreetbets,0.0
0,2018-09-06,"Well I don’t know your broker so I don’t know how they deal with a margin call. But some buy the shares you are assigned and float you. Then you can keep paying off the margin over time or sell all the shares at once and cover the margin. Some have a grace period.

Like I said selling naked is a bad idea. Robinhood won’t let you sell naked and that’s a good thing.

Remember when selling puts if the stock blows below your strike you are obligated to buy at your strike. So if it’s 16.5 and it expires at 14 then you lose 2.5 times 55 times 100 = 13,750

That’s not including the 77 grand to purchase.

You sound a little out of your depth and i don’t mean any disrespect I just want you to not owe someone 100 grand in a month.

Selling puts is a good play for high IV stock 30 to 45 DTE. Like I said you can buy the lower strike put for cover and just keep on top of your position. No harm in buying to close the position if it looks dicey.

I just did a bull put credit spread on Facebook. Bought the 165 put and sold the 175 put for October. It hit 177 and I had a weird feeling and bought to close. I made profit and now I’m going to open a new spread soon.

Technically true but remember the dividend will account for $0.15 of that decline in share price.

Also, the IV on the Dec $9 calls is in the low 20s - probably better to follow /u/trogan234 and buy calls on the dip or sell premium with higher IV/shorter DTE.",Ryhearst,wallstreetbets,0.0

0,2018-10-06,"Uhm not even remotely true... October tends to be a very volatile month but it's not a bad month for stocks.

In fact the average return for October from 1950 to 2017 was +.78%.  42 up years and 26 down years. Here's a fun little calculator for you: http://www.moneychimp.com/features/monthly_returns.htm

Maybe get your facts straight before making broad generalized statements?  

Also, if you're 100% in cash than you're a fucking moron.  I could understand you saying you were buying and holding stock or buying 60 DTE contracts on the dip but this is absolutely the time to buy. Why would you wait for things to return to higher levels before buying?  

Tech has earnings in a couple of weeks... now this sounds like your first earnings season so go research what an earnings run up is. These big tech names, regardless of valuations see tons of money thrown at them to catch the pop from earnings. And, if you're gonna suggest that Apple or Amazon or Microsoft are about to miss earnings than you're an ever bigger idiot than your ""DD"" led me to believe. ",Xayde26,wallstreetbets,0.0

1,2018-10-08,Nah not enough premium unless you’re holding enough shares. If I were holding enough shares I would sell faggies to you autists every week.  I tend to sell 30 DTE that’s typically when theta gets exponential. Longer than that and you get more premium but theta is slower. ,riodeshake,wallstreetbets,1.0
0,2018-10-09,"I think it all depends on the amount of money equity you are dealing with as well as the DTE. If you have $100 that rises 50% you now made $50. You can afford to have it rise another 50% because the risk isn’t that large. But if you are risking $20k which is expiring in less than a month, you should be looking to get out at 10-20%/ASAP because the risk then becomes much larger. 

EDIT: also look at it in terms of how much you can earn per week/month. If you are able to earn $500/ week, that’s gonna be $40k a year.",Godmode92,wallstreetbets,0.0
0,2018-10-10,"bought a single FD put on Visa this morning to hedge my january call spread against what seemed like was going to be a shit day. it's up like 230% since visa fell like $6.70 today. feels real good. profitable on my Visa position overall even though it's WAY more in 100+ DTE calls.  

i never really fuck with FD's and just browse this sub mostly for laughs. but today, it actually made sense as a cheap hedge, and it feels so good. have to make sure i don't get addicted... i'll see you at the soup kitchen next week probably. ",BreezyWrigley,wallstreetbets,0.0
0,2018-11-04,"No FD's are ""good"" FD's. There are just winners and losers. Lucky and unlucky. 

I make most of my money on 14 DTE options. You can still cash them out like FD's if the underlying moves rapidly to your strike, albeit smaller gains. However if your underlying trades sideways or against you, you still have time to be right. At the very least, breaking even becomes more of a possibility when a trade moves against you in an FD amount of time. ",Trrrrvs,wallstreetbets,0.0

I play just the Index Trend game (SPX &amp; NDX) now and focusing purely on the Technicals.  I ride the wave for every pullback.

Pre-Earnings game is almost always a 50/50.  Neutral trades have such a low ROC.

I switch completely to Indexes since individual stocks are just so irrational especially if you’re just going for Weekly options. Individual stock options have better odds I think only if you aim for at least 2-4 months DTE.",cydworth,wallstreetbets,0.0
