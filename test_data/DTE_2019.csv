0,2019-01-01,"Hi hi. I’m a noob too! I’ll attribute the bulk of my success to luck (and not having full-blown autism)

I buy plain vanilla calls/puts, no complicated option strategies.

The DTE depends on a few things for me:
1. Do I have daytrades available? If yes, I can consider same day expiring options.
2. Is there a clear tradable pattern? If yes, is it intra-day or multi-day? If it’s intra-day, can consider same day expiring options and can buy BIG (30% of account) for HUGE gains. Close trade as soon as the pattern isn’t going according to plan. If it’s a multi-day trend, can considering buying 3 to 7 trading days to expiry options. 
3. How long can I stay awake? I’m day trading from outside the states and the stock market opens at 10:30pm on my side. I try to sleep by 2 or 3am so I don’t buy same-day expiring options and stay up to monitor it unless there’s a high chance it’s gonna be a winning trade.

For winners, I hold until I no longer believe it’s going to go any higher any time soon. This can be 1 to 5 days. I monitor SPY along with 5 of the largest stocks in S&amp;P. The chart patterns in the 5 stocks can be indicative of how SPY will move.

For losers, I don’t really hve a strategy. I will consult the charts and see if the original plan before entering the position is still valid. If it no longer is, then I’ll close it at a loss.

The idea is to look for the multi-day trend I think. Let me explain:
SPY is now in a multi-day uptrend which is in a multi-week/month downtrend. (Maybe read up on Elliot wave) So I won’t be buying puts. I will buy calls whenever the hourly trend is bearish and the candlesticks are at support. Since the market can be inexplicably erratic these days, I buy them 3 to 5 trading days out. I sell them on gapped up market opens when it seems like it’s not going to run much higher.",bumber123,wallstreetbets,0.0

0,2019-01-10,"Theta does not decay options in a strict linear pattern. If it has Theta of 10, it's no guarantee that it will actually lower in value by $10 per day, even if the price stayed the same. Theta seems to hit harder in the range from 45 DTE to 3 or 4 DTE. It's just an average.

The other primary factor in pricing is volatility. And lastly, you have the free market as well. I can't say for sure what caused the fluctuations in yours.

Earnings plays can be good but risky.  Consider buy-writes or spreads to collect premiums.

1,2019-08-08,"MSFT ATM call, +1yr DTE (min 1yr). It’s called a leap. It’s a leveraged option, which is already leveraged. Go put it in a back tester.

5% movement in MSFT represented generally 10-20% movement in the leap. This works both up and down, but generally MSFT is growth stock.

Advantages: 
* If MSFT moves against you, you literally have a year for it to move back. 
* You don’t hold it for a year. Repeat after me DO NOT HOLD OPTIONS TO EXPIRY. My leaps last 2-3mths
* It’s leveraged as fuck. Small movements represent big gains, with relatively safe risk (see point 1)

Disadvantage:
* unlike stocks, if msft moves against you and you wait and wait, and it never recovers, you lose it all. See point 2 above. Do not hold it to expiration. Theta will murder you. Seriously, leaps are murdered by theta if you hold them too long. 
* big capital. A leap on MSFT is typically around $1.5k. You actually want to buy slightly ITM. But if you’re confident in the stock, then the risk is more buying power reduction. I typically go for $10k of leaps, but your portfolio will vary.
* Premiums matter, on a good day the leaps are expensive. Wait for a day when MSFT is going down.

Other notes:
* You can only do leaps on limited stocks and get good performance. It has to be well established, BYND even if it had chains that far out would be insane.
* Leaps are very much a set a limit and wait for a fill, do not chase an open and DO NOT DO A MARKET ORDER, FFS SAY NO TO MARKET ORDERS PEOPLE.
* It must be a growth stock (ok technically you could do it on a bear stock, but that’s risky)
* it must have volume. WM is awesome, but there just isn’t the movement. You’re not looking to carry the leap to expiration. You want in and out within a few months at most. Despite WMs growth, the needle just wouldn’t move.
* Be careful with volatile stocks. SPY is a growth stock, but it moves a lot. Way too much. 
* Backtest. If you have access to the tools, run a leap on a stock and see how it performed. That will show you that WM sucks despite growing well, and MSFT printed tendies.

Buying longer dated options as I can afford them, like 14 DTE. Too impatient for that 1 month stuff.

1,2019-09-05,"Vega is volatility. The long and short leg of the vertical spread are correspondingly long and short vega, and therefore movements in IV (Implied Volatility) have minimal effects on the position.

Gamma is the second order of Delta but I phrased that part incorrectly. Charm, or the change in Delta in respect to DTE (Days to Expiration), is the correct word to use. Naked calls have a decaying delta over time, which means that huge moves in the underlying have the greatest effect on the option price when you buy the call, and it decreases with every passing day.

https://www.optiontradingtips.com/images/option-charm.gif

On the other hand, vertical spreads have a very low delta far out from expiration, and as expiration approaches delta increases, which is a better tool for targeting specific future dates (cheaper to manage early on).

As for theta, spreads have positive theta as the price approaches and passes the short leg (which would be the upper bound price in a bull call spread). As you can imagine, if your max profit is at 150 and the underlying stock is currently at 160 with 20 DTE, then the position will gain value every day rather than lose value as it becomes more certain that the position will indeed close at max profit.

I can't answer your specific msft question as the msft call value depends on the share price and the strike of the call, which you didn't provide. If the call was close to expiry, then the fall in value was almost certainly theta erasing your extrinsic value in the call.

When you hold a naked call you own profit in every price level from your strike up to infinity. As you can imagine, as expiration approaches, the likelihood of the share price skyrocketing to levels far above your strike decreases at an ever accelerating rate. While there's a small chance for MSFT to hit 150 with 30DTE, there's an impossibly small chance for MSFT to jump to 150 with 2 days left. If your short leg for a bull call spread was at 140, then you never owned this outlandish possibility of profit in the first place and are not subject to its decay.

https://www.projectoption.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ATM_Decay_Curve.svg?x34254)

In general, it's a bad idea to hold naked calls under 30 DTE unless you're strictly looking to capitalize on a parabolic upswing and corresponding IV spike, or they're part of a larger position that has some longer term exposure as well. Sometimes they're also valuable if you think a huge pop will come sometime soon but don't quite know when, and want to ensure you fully capture this movement when it does occur.",mechtech,wallstreetbets,1.0

You're likely going to see that IV is higher. With higher IV, you usually have higher overall extrinsic value, which must decay until expiration. This means the options have to lose more value on the same amount of time (0-5 DTE, as in your example). That means faster decay, including faster intraday decay.",bfreis,wallstreetbets,1.0

2,2019-12-04,"Essentially if you look at outstanding options on SPY you can see that in order for the currently outstanding options to remain delta neutral (most market makers objectives) they will have to flip their positions from long to short or short to long at these levels. Thus fueling the moves that would push them through such levels in the first place.  


If market makers sell 1,000 calls with delta of 0.8, then they buy 80,000 shares to remain delta neutral.  


If market sells and delta falls to say 0.5 then they have to re balance accordingly to remain delta neutral. In this scenario the market maker would be forced to sell 62.5% of its shares that were originally purchased in order to accommodate the change in delta. (0.5/0.8=62.5%)

If market than rallied afterword market maker would have to add shares to positions as delta increased.  


Essentially you can think about it as an asymptotic relationship where the need to purchase / sell shares in order to remain delta neutral increases as you approach these price points, and the need to do so decreases the closer you are to the median of these points.

 [http://www.optionstradingiq.com/the-wheel-strategy/](http://www.optionstradingiq.com/the-wheel-strategy/) 

Read this and then point to me where the naked calls are go ahead Ill wait.

You clearly don't know what your talking about. (I'm not surprised, most people here don't even know what option writing is). If you don't understand why a purchaser of put/call options is buying insurance. Then you need to take your series 7 again.

Lets go through the basics again.

A put is a right, but not an obligation to sell stock by the expired date.

A call is a right but not an obligation to buy stock by the expired date.

Why are purchasers of this contract considered buying insurance? Because the writer (aka underwiter) is guaranteeing to you (the purchaser) that should the stock fall below the strike (in the case of puts) that they will buy your stock at an agreed upon price. This is insurance my friend. I, the option writer, is guaranteeing your max loss is defined by the difference in strike price of the contract plus the premium.

Now on the call side why is this also insurance? Because lets say your an airline and you want to ensure that your fuel costs are fixed. Should the price of the fuel rise by 5%, your suddenly unprofitable. So what do you do? You buy call options. Again I the option writer of calls is guaranteeing that you can acquire fuel at a maximum fixed cost. Now what do I get for taking on such a risk? Premium. Its not by accident that its called premium.

Next. As an option writer you should know the key differences between undefined risk and defined risk. Lets go over the basics again. Selling a put is considered ""defined risk"" that is no matter what price the share goes to (even zero) there is a defined risk. So long as you cash secure this transaction there is NO MARGIN requirement. For the call side, if you sell naked calls there is what we call ""undefined risk"". The losses could be unlimited. Now why did James Cordier blow up his fund? Its because he engaged in naked call selling. What is the lesson here? DO NOT SELL NAKED CALLS PERIOD. If you have to, you better be prepared to cover quickly.

Now after having explained to you the basics why do option writers win over the long run?

A couple reasons.

1. Options pricing is based on the  **Black**\-**Scholes**  (if you exclude LEAPS) pricing model. This means that you are theta positive. As time progresses you have an ever increasing burden to meet the break even point as a buyer. Especially so during the 5 DTE period.
2. In the event of assignment, you are either giving away stock you own, or buying stock in which you cash secured. Now you have the option to take the opposite position (either writing a call or put). Eventually you will recover your acb and more and turn a losing position to an immensely profitable one.
3. You only underwrite good companies. Just like an insurance carrier only writes good drivers. So too should you. This means that even if your saddled with shares, you want them anyway in the long run. This is a very risk adverse strategy. Dont believe me, why don't you have a chat with the big guy Warren Buffet.

Next time you want to talk shit about option writing you better put your money where your mouth is. Ill write the above mentioned companies all day and your welcome to take the opposite side to prove me wrong. In some ways you know its true, you just wont admit it to yourself. Just peruse all the losers here. Who do you think is on the opposite side of that trade? Option writers like me.",FullTime_Autist,wallstreetbets,2.0
