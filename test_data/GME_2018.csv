0,2018-04-11,"I disagree on the whole but that is a thought provoking point about capital allocation. 


When the bulls run out of gas, I'd rather GME have distributed their profits to shareholders for the past 2 years than invested in growth opportunities at the peak of a 9-year bull market only to have growth on that capital mauled up by the bears. At least that's money in my pocket instead of paper gains that depend on my own market timing to realize.


Plus from the point of view of price decline, GME doesn't have much lower to go as its already being priced as if it will be bankrupt in 5 years. I think it will take much less of a beating during a general sell-off than will companies valued on speculations of fantastic future growth.

0,2018-05-10,"They just took a huge ($350M) impairment, and are still trading at $1.3B marketcap with a book value of $2.2B. The $1.6B in goodwill they're holding onto makes a bit uneasy, but after the impairment, that's 70% of their intangible assets.
All of their long term debt is coming due to 2019 and 2021, and their cash flow is such that they appear to be in fantastic position to pay it off and refinance at what are still very low rates.

Paying off debt, massive dividend, huge discount to book, incoming share buybacks. @$12.93 and $1.52 annual dividend, they're at a 11.75% dividend with under a 50% payout ratio.

I think GME is the most undervalued stock on the market, with fantastic income, a fantastic margin of safety and investments in business with moats (ATT partnerships and pop culture licensing rights).

I'm even optimistic about their physical video game sales. 1/3 of their customers trade games to them. There is still a massive market for physical video games due to limitations in internet coverage, storage space on consoles (which I don't believe will go away soon. As the space increases, the developers use more space for their games) and one fact that you can't get around. 
Children don't have or use credit cards. They shop physically, in person, and Gamestop stores are awesome. I used to spend hours in their stores looking through all of the games and playing the demos.

In addition, their diversification into technology (ATT stores and Simply Mac stores) as well as pop culture gear (ThinkGeek), and based on their most recent earnings call, plans to expand into apparel show me that they are no Blockbuster waiting for their impending doom.
Combine their attempts to diversify with the thick dividend and their unreal cash flow, raining Benjamin's up in this bitch.

4,2018-05-10,"I love GME and have been considering picking up both ETP and CTL but I don't know enough about their businesses.

CTL is perfect for a play that I've been considering that's similar to what OP proposed, but with deep ITM leap calls.

Mark on CTL Jan2020 $1C is about $17. CTL ended today at $18.
Play is you buy 100 CTL, sell the $1Jan2020, leaving you with $1 debit, and CTL shares you get to hold until the option is exercised. Each quarter at $.52 quarterly dividend is a return of 52%, breaking even after the second quarter. I believe the difficulty would be finding someone to buy your call without a considerable discount built in, but if you could find a buyer it's a way to leverage out delta neutral passive income.

7,2018-09-07,I don't see it happening. I believe the PE firms are looking to scrap the company as an end goal. The business plan is no longer applicable and GME has been unable to change the trend in years now. The real estate they sit on I bet is overvalued. Stores are closing and their physical stock is going to be worthless. ,spatela,wallstreetbets,7.0
