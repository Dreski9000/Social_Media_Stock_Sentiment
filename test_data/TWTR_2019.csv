Which basically breaks me even and keeps 5 contracts at 7.50 strike now i would have to hope that twtr keeps gaining good to close the others out at a much higher price then 500 bucks to make it be worth holdong half. Or i can just hold through most of the day tomorrow hoping for a short squeeze and cash out all 10 options when im around 1500-2000 in profit.

0,2019-02-08,"So here just a quick example. Today, you could have sold one covered call option with a strike price of $31 that expires on 2/15 for $80. You get the $80 cash instantly; it's yours. Now, on 2/15, at the end of the trading day, if TWTR is at $31 or higher, you will be forced to sell 100 shares at $31, and you keep the $80. If it's below $31, you keep your shares and the $80 (you keep the $80 no matter what). So you could have sold 4 of these today for a total of $320. Does that make sense? Obviously, you want to sell your shares for at least $34.42, but with options your choice is $34 or $34.50. Anyways, next time TWTR has a really green day, sell covered calls for $34.50 with an expiration dated around April for a bit of cash. 
I'll share one more thing. When you buy stock on an ER Play, that's super risky, as you know. But if you want to play it buying stock, you ought to study up on ""put options"", which will protect your stock. It's an insurance policy that guarantees that you can sell your stock at $34.50 now matter how far it falls. ",yolo_sense,wallstreetbets,0.0
1,2019-02-08,"I have a schwab account too. You own the stock, so you want to ""Sell to open"" a ""call"". You can sell one call option for every 100 stocks you own. How much TWTR stock do you own? I'll assume you own 400 shares (for this example). you go to ""trade options"" on Schwab (but first you might have to get schwab to approve you to trade options), then select ""sell to open"", and choose your desired sell (""strike"") price for your shares and choose an expiration date. The further out the more money someone will give you. I'll pretend that your average cost for your shares are $34. So next time TWTR is up a bit, I'd sell a $34 call dated April.

250 by April, but I could see it happening earlier if we get some bad news from fed (inflation, trade talks, etc).  That's really what this whole thing is riding on right now.  From there it's a new ball game, but I'm leaning more towards a retest of 230 with how fast we went up.  Target for that would be June.

4,2019-02-10,"&gt; I can make some money off my twitter shares. Anyone know if this is true?

Sort of. Most important to keep in mind is not to write more calls than you have lots (1 lot = 100 shares) since then the call goes from covered to naked. A naked option has a lot more risk exposure for the seller.

Let's say you write a covered call with a strike of $35/share for April 2019. The market price for that option is around $0.75 which means you would get $75 per contract - that is $0.75 * 100 shares.

Best case scenario, TWTR stays under $35 and you get to pocket the $75.  
Worst case scenario, TWTR goes to $40 (or higher) and you get assigned at $35. That means you're forced to sell 100 shares at $35 per contract. You still get to keep the $75 per contract though.

Pro tip: once you've sold to open, leave a Good Til Cancelled Buy to Close order at $0.01. At a certain point, it is better to close out your current position and open up a new one further out with a better premium.",uiri,wallstreetbets,4.0

1,2019-02-11,"My account is only around 25k .. and with spreads though arent you limited on how much you make? I want to be able to collect a premium lets say 1.00 on a stock that shot up high and then when the stock comes back down or stays flat im making money on the time decay and will buy it back when it reaches lets say 50 or 60 cents. I done this with covered calls but the problem is yea im making money by selling the premium but im losing money on the stock dropping down since I have to own the shares how do I avoid the part where I have to own shares but still can sell premium.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if its confusing but  i want to be able to sell premium with out losing money by having shares that ""cover"" the calls because I dont want all that capitol tied up, plus if the stock goes down I will be losing money on the value of shares i own but making money on the sold premium.  

Perfect example last week I sold 2 contracts of twiter for earnings. So i had to buy 200 shares of twtr and made 450 bucks on selling the premium. That was great, the problem was twiter dropped 4 bucks and the 455 bucks that i made in premium basically wiped out and made nothing since I'm holding shares of twtr that I paid 34.00 per share and now twtr is only at 30 bucks. How do I avoid the downside of holding shares and losing there value but still benefit on selling the premium. ",will70723,wallstreetbets,1.0

2,2019-02-12,"It works for both directions. To use a call as an example, delta is a positive number (option goes up if stock goes up, and down if stock goes down) and theta is negative (it is for every option; the number is the amount the option loses each day). Here's a simple example, ignoring everything except delta and theta: say a stock closes at $30, and a 31c expiring in two weeks is worth $0.50, with Δ=0.38 and Θ=-0.04. If the stock closes at $30.50 the next day, the option will now be worth  
    0.50 + (30.5-30)*0.38 - 0.04 = 0.65  
but if the stock closes at $29.5, the option will be worth

0,2019-03-09,"So I ran over the [Dark Pool buying](https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix?) + [Smart Money Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_money_index) thing I posted [about earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ayv9hm/weekend_discussion_thread_march_810_2019/ei3jky9/). Here's an update with Friday's information. 

My process is this: I look over the list Squeeze Metrics puts out for subscribers that lists unusual dark pool buying or selling activity. If I see a name pop up a couple of times, I cross reference it with the Smart Money Index to see if the broader market confirms. 

I also sometimes check out particular names I'm interested in that don't necessarily pop up on that ""unusual acitvity"" list. SAP was one such catch. Next time I'm going to try and keep my personal/subjective picks on a separate list. 

**Lots of Dark Pool Buying + SMI trending or reversing upwards:**

1. ABB 
2. AMZN
3. BCS
4. C
5. **DWDP** (was on my previous list)
6. IVZ
7. JNUG
8. **MO** (was on my previous list)
8. MOMO (earnings this week)
9. NEM
10. **SAP** (was on my previous list)
10. SOGO
11. SRPT
12. WFC
13. **XOM** (was on my previous list)

Changes from previous list:

- Dark pool buying volume or proportion of buying for FOXA, ITUB, LLY, NKTR, NTNX, ORCL, and TSM dropped off considerably Friday. 

- RIO had an increase in dark pool selling Friday, but Thursday was also its ex-dividend date, so that may have played a role. 

**Lots of Dark Pool Selling + SMI trending or reversing downwards:**

1. BGS
2. DFEN
3. DUST
4. INGN
5. PRS
6. PRA

Notes on this list:

- CQQQ and KWEB have appeared on the ""unusual selling"" list but SMI isn't showing a confirmation. Similarly, INDL (the 3x leveraged India Bull ETF), EWW (Mexico ETF) have all had unusual selling this week, and YINN (3x China bull ETF) and EEM (Emerging Markets ETF) popped up yesterday but again the SMI isn't clear.  

- TSLA likewise has seen heavy dark pool selling these past few days but isn't being confirmed by the SMI. It's notable that before Musk's big announcement about the cheaper model 3, they were however doing lots of buying.

- IAU (gold ETF) has been on the unusual selling list a lot, but SMI isn't confirming and it seems odd that there'd be buying of gold miners and selling of miner bear ETFs at the same time. 

**Broad Sector/Index Notes:**

1. SPY: Increased dark pool buying each of the last three days
2. QQQ: Increased

Other notes:

- Last week/early this week saw lots of selling of small caps and biotech. Friday though saw heavy buying of TNA, the 3x small cap bull etf. IWM and XBI also seem to be trending upwards in regards to proportion (but not aggregate volume) of buying:selling.

- Thursday saw lots of buying in FB and selling of SQQQ. Friday reversed that, with FB seeing lots of dark pool selling and QQQ and TQQQ getting sold. 

- FANG names are mixed. AMZN, BABA, NFLX seem strong. BIDU, FB, NVDA, TSLA, and TWTR seem weak. AAPL and GOOG flat/holding steady. ",FireSail,wallstreetbets,0.0

0,2019-04-11,"Sure thing!

My main earnings strategy is to sell far out of the money puts the day before the earnings release. The expiry I pick is the closest one to the day after earnings which will have the highest implied volatility. Implied volatility (IV) is very high right before an earnings release because the non-inside traders don't know if the stock will go up or down. It's a gamble. Some stocks are more volatile than others. Companies like $AMD or $TSLA are going to move huge while other companies like $JPM (tomorrow morning) may not move so much. The higher the IV the more money there is to be made. 

&amp;#x200B;

After the earnings release the IV drops an outstanding amount because everyone knows what has happened. This is what is referred to as ""IV crush"". For example, $BBBY had an IV of 129% before close 4/10/19 and dropped to \~50-70% on open today. You will recall from your Black-Scholes options mathematics that Vega is the relation of an options contract price to IV. Price goes up, IV goes up, price goes down, IV goes down. Basically, you can guarantee that every earnings release on every company will experience enormous IV crush. If you buy the calls or puts you're screwed by this no matter what direction you pick. If you sell a call or put you can capitalize on this IV crush by selling the contact when the premium is grossly inflated and buying it back cheap after the crush.

&amp;#x200B;

So why ""far OTM strikes""? This strategy is not foolproof. If you sell an ATM put and the stock shits (like $BBBY did today) the change in Delta (the relation of the underlying to the options contract price \[e.g. stock goes down, call price goes down, put price goes up; stock goes up, call price goes up, put price goes down\]) may cause you to lose money if the change in Delta is larger than the decrease in Vega. Remember that when you sell a put the worst case scenario is that your contact expires in the money and you are assigned and will own 100 shares per option contact on whatever stock you picked at the strike price you picked (although the stock price may drop much lower than whatever strike price you picked so you will own shares that are worth much less). If your contact expires out of the money you get to keep the premium you collected in full. The name of the game is to pick a strike that will not expire in the money. So look at how the stock moves during past earnings. $BBBY moves like 15-20%, so you need to pick a strike that can tolerate that movement and not be in the money. $LULU moves like 20% on earnings. If your strike is low enough you don't need to be too worried if the stock shits the bed 20%. 

&amp;#x200B;

When you sell puts the profit is capped so this is not yacht-making money. The return for the lower profits though is a higher probability of success which if you execute this strategy over and over again you will start to accumulate some nice wins and you can start to laugh at the people who buy calls and puts the day before earnings and lose their ass on the I V  C R U S H and that they picked the wrong direction. 

&amp;#x200B;

Below are some real trades I have made illustrating what I have described:

&amp;#x200B;

3/20/19: $MU sold to open 22 MAR 40p at 1.35 at 109% IV.

3/21/19: $MU bought to close 22 MAR 40p at 0.29 at 60% IV (1.06 profit). 

3/27/19: $LULU sold to open 29 MAR 130p at 1.62 at 135 IV.

3/28/19: $LULU bought to close 29 MAR 130p at 0.02 at 80% IV (1.60 profit).

4/2/19: $GME sold to open 12 APR 8.5p at 0.16 at 113% IV.

4/3/19: $GME bought to close 12 APR 8.5p at 0.13 at 65% IV. ($GME shit the bed. This one came close to not being profitable but it worked out for a tiny 0.03 profit).

4/10/19: $BBBY sold to open 18 APR 15p at 0.14 at 129% IV.

4/11/19: $BBBY bought to close 18 APR 15p at 0.04 at 70% IV. ($BBBY shit the bed too but the IV crush was massive too. Doesn't matter, 0.10 profit).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm all cash at the moment (aside from a small position in $REML) in preparation for $NFLX earnings on Tuesday. The 18 APR contacts are already around 69% IV and they usually trade around 35% (forecasting a 34% I V  C R U S H already!). You could sell the 18 APR 312.5p at 1.00 and tolerate a 15% drop in the stock after earnings. Not a bad buffer. After that we have $TWTR, $FB, $TSLA, $AMD, and $AAPL.

0,2019-06-07,"Some of the bigger holdings I actively bought to 'trade' that I can remember were my NVDA shares. About 700 shares?, buying the dip from 24 to single digits and bagholding it for years only to sell before it really really took off. Towards the last few years when it started breaking out of the $30s. Anyways I remember selling the last lot around low 100s. Think I left 250k on the table all things considered by selling early cuz I needed the money for other investment. It worked out but man. This will always be one of my bigger regrets as I KEPT buying the dip and knew it'll materialize eventually. It was hard to hold when it basically came back from $6 to $30s, then 40s, 50s 80s etc etc.

Other stuff includes lots of bank stock, C I bagheld until 2017 or so as well, selling them at high 50s. Kept buying those dips thru 2008 and 2009 as well.

Got a bunch of random companies in $1k-$2k amount. Lots of throwing dart in board shit lol.

I had some shares of Tweeter which is this best buy-like electronics and speaker big box retailer. It's ticker was TWTR (yep) before it went bankrupt and went OTC. I didn't even know it happened until it received the bankruptcy paper in the mail. It was pretty funny to see it back in the news when people started buying it up when TWTR (Twitter) started getting IPO chatter and people were buying the wrong fucking stock.

Another good baghold was PNRA (Panera Bread) in the 20s before it got bought out by PE for like 250 or whatever.

All the index and mutual funds I bought obviously have done well and I didn't start unloading them until Q4 and Q2 of this year. Sitting pretty heavy on cash in my tax accounts still. Probably 30-40% cash.

If we crash again, I probably will be doing the same knife catching again, hopefully this time being a bit smarter about my selection so the bankruptcy notification letters can be kept to a minimal heh.",freehouse_throwaway,wallstreetbets,0.0

Luckily the last few days have been stellar for profits - I hope you've found the advice from the last few posts useful. Recommended options so far have been on point!

Again, plenty of opportunities to make $$$$$ on both sides. Bulls and bears can easily win in this market. Just a matter of timing your entries/exits right, picking some good stocks and being patient. Here are the stocks I'll be watching closely. Apologies if it's a bit rushed - I've got some deadlines to meet asap and the time dwindles.

**Stocks for the BULLISH crowd:**

* PYPL is a bullish power play rn. So is CRWD (can moon any second!)
* APPL and FB ain't looking too shabby if you're feeling bullish and want to play a FAANG. Keep an eye on TWTR, LK and XLNX as well
* SQ and ROKU should keep climbing up. Monster potential for SQ til the end of the week.
* If you want a longer dated call, ZEN and TWLO, and NYT won't let you down

**Stocks to play if you're feeling BEARISH:**

* COST, WMT, CMG, LYFT (Lyft puts only for a day or two... It should pick back up after)
* Bear power play: SFIX, NFLX
* TSLA. Very few reasons to be bullish, plenty to be bearish. If trading TSLA is your thing make sure you think twice before getting calls. Flip a coin 3 times, see if it lands on its side.

STAY AWAY FROM BA/CRM/BABA/SHOP (if you want your trades to be better than pure gambling). These are treacherous stocks atm.

Separately, the White House may also be looking to attempt to regulate Facebook and Twitter over alleged anti-conservative bias, reported CNN last Friday.

Also election year is coming up in 50 days. Twitter has banned Political Ads, FB hasn't, citing free speech, is all but embracing all the political ads revenues. All Twitter politicians can now only advertize on Facebook. No other platforms besides Twitter and FB have that kind of reach. With Twitter out, every political campaign ad will go to Facebook.

So $FB Ad revenues for 2020 will be off the charts!

1,2019-11-11,"The only relatively high probability win rate is to gain from IV:

* buy weeks before, sell right before earnings (long IV)
* sell strangles (or iron condors) right before earnings with closest DTE possible and wait (short IV). IC less risk but less premium than ICs.  Strangles work well *most* of the times (GOOG, AMZN, SQ, TWTR etc..), but in the rare case (e.g TSLA's last earnings), an IC would be the only way to protect you and strangles could wipe out all the gains you made in the past few months and then some..

Do NOT buy right before earnings. IV crush will kill you. If you want to buy, do it much earlier with a relatively long DTE like you would for usual options.",chodmode2,wallstreetbets,1.0

In general I thought this was just TWTR giving up gains due to market selling off, but in this case it's literally just a reinforcement of the investors giving a big fuck you back to Dorsey because he's viewed as a part time CEO who isn't actually effective and is just around for shits and giggles.

Investors don’t want to keep getting burned by investing in twtr every time because of shit management decisions. If Dorsey was like zuckerberg or nadella it would be in the mid 30s right now and potentially wouldn’t have even sold off so heavily 

The miss they had was on revenue due to aD bugs. Their core platform had massive user growth like 15-20% 

Any social media app with that kind of growth shouldn’t drop 30%, since revenue bugs can be fixed short term. It’s the fact they don’t have faith management can execute",cpgupta561,wallstreetbets,0.0

0,2019-12-07,"I was formerly bearish on TWTR but if you think about it FB actually needs to keep TWTR propped up in order to avoid further scrutiny as a social monopoly. So contrarily, FB actually kind of needs TWTR as a foil to its own future success.

TWTR is flat vs one year ago while FB AAPL etc are all up 40-50%+. The recent slump was HUGE and puts it at a major discount relative to these juggernauts which IMO means it is now very undervalued. I am long on FB and I may imminently be long on TWTR. 

I like TWTR's staying power as they have become more of a NETWORK than a social network. I.E., their users are now essentially the pre-digital equivalent of television shows, having the President et al with their own followers. 

Even if they are not growing in userbase I think they will monetize more successfully as the importance of the network to its users (the shows) means it is unlikely to go anywhere anytime soon. Even if it is not growing as fast as FB, if FB and others grow 10-25% in 2020 in terms of stock price, why wouldn't TWTR revive to match their #s if the sudden drop was an event that was severely overblown?",developmentfiend,wallstreetbets,0.0

[https://imgur.com/a/JSRweNy](https://imgur.com/a/JSRweNy)

Top P/L chart is long the 33 call, doesn't break even until 34.55, then behaves like long stock above that.

Bottom chart is the ZEBRA (Zero Extrinsic Back Ratio spread), it's short the .50 delta call, and +2 .70 delta calls.  You'll pay $680 instead of $156, but it breaks even at 30.42, so more likely you keep your tendies.",3whiskeywhiskey,wallstreetbets,1.0
