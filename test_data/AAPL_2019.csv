Also planning to get some GS calls because I think they'll have a spike once they settle with prosecutors over the whole MDB1 thing. 

I had about $26,000 k in AAPL $155 Jan 2021 calls and another AMZN $1400 Jan 2021 call, both of which I got stopped out of (at a profit). Wondering if I should have let them ride but whatever. Think there'll be a pullback and chance to jump back in.

177,2019-01-02,"...are you serious?  It's because AAPL is a bellweather.  It predicts how other tech companies will do - that revenue is not just hardware, it's service revenue.  Service revenue is where most of the large tech companies are making their margins.  

&amp;#x200B;

So, smaller margins means that earnings will be lower.  lower earnings means price multiple no longer applies, so the effective fair value drops a bunch, especially since the stock is priced to perfection.

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore, APPL making less money means they spend less money.  Their employee numbers fall, and salaries go down.  All the companies that depend on AAPL to make sales in order to then make sales themselves lose revenue.  It's a ripple effect created because AAPL has been so dominant in their industry for so long - there's only one teat and when it starts to dry up, a lot of babies are going to starve.

This is a 2 year old product. Apple should be a big enough company and have sophisticated enough tools to analyze its customer markets and avoid these types of product supply problems.

16,2019-01-04,"Dude, I'm trying to help you.  If you are going to post your ""research"" you should at least know how to quantifiably get to your estimate.  You pulled a 50% drop out of your ass; nobody thinks AAPL is going to drop to 70, because they have done the math, and the research, and can understand how stock prices are derived.  I don't have any apple stock, I actually use a pixel 3, but trading is about being knowledgeable - instead of trying to learn a little bit, you just double down on being a moron.  That's what makes you stupid - not the fact that you tried to do an analysis and did it poorly, but that you stick to it, because you refuse to accept that you don't know what you are doing.  You have to be honest with yourself before you can improve.  I don't think you are cut out for trading, in any way, shape, or form.

17,2019-01-04,"2008 saw the biggest fall of 61.5% from the previous high. 

Here are the interesting points: 

* For the prior 3 ""drops,"" AAPL regained its All Time High 22, 23, and 22 months after losing it. Remarkably consistent. 

* Six months after re-obtaining the previous high, the stock increased 34%, 28.6% and 20.8% from that original high

Also note that 2 of the 3 ""big drops"" since the 2008 financial crisis occurred in the Post-Jobs Era. For a decade, analysts have said ""Apple won't survive without Jobs."" 

Maybe this time is different. But Apple will mark record profits this year and record earnings per share. 

Near term catalysts: earnings, possible dovish Fed, end of shutdown, end of trade war 

Long term catalysts: release of 5G iPhone in 2020 (it's a hardware update, and will cause some people to buy the new iPhone). Also Apple has recent patents and hirings that point to the development of a AR/VR system

I am, long it, and look to Q2-Q3.

Apple is also moving into more services, which could derive a more sustainable income. I think Apple knows how to recover, and they will, they've done it before, and once they do, I think they could hit $240, maybe more, regardless of iPhone sales.

55,2019-01-03,"Then sell July 200 strike calls, they're only $100 each and lower theta,  but you'll have that peace of mind that your shares are safe. Heck... you could sell LEAP options (Jan 2021) expiry @ 200 strike. That's roughly $12,000 in premium if you sell calls against all of your shares. 

But if you've got that much faith in AAPL (and more cash to play with), you might just want to sell short term puts instead of risking your shares. Example, the February 120 put is \~$170. You could sell those and if you get assigned, you get to reduce your AAPL cost basis by buying shares at $120 plus you keep that premium to reduce your cost basis further.

This trade war could end within 3-6 months, who knows. But options premiums are insanely inflated right now from all this volatility, give em' a chance, starting small is a good idea, try a couple covered calls on far OTM strikes

Apple is actually very well managed; their very obvious and long tenured shift towards service revenue and cloud services means they can potentially continue to see high margin growth, even in a recession.  The issue here is that nobody could predict what would happen in the US, with a party in place whose mantra for the last 30 years has been ""free trade"".  What we are seeing now is the direct effect of not just US, but global nationalism, and the eradication of free trade as the two biggest economies in the world square off about philosophy.  The market doesn't listen to what companies say.  This is not the fault of the company; it's the market.

Bear in mind that AAPL is still making 85B, as opposed to the 89-mid 90's that was predicted by the analysts.  What exactly could you have done better?

The real story here is that there is a fundamental difference in the way the world economy is moving - credit markets are tightening across the globe, so growth, while still present, will slow down.

That said, I think this trend is only starting and probably not hurting their bottom line too much. Right now I'd guess it's the trade war and bad pricing combo. So I don't think it makes AAPL a short in the future, because they still have growth from their services to look forward to. But I don't think it's an obvious growth pick any more.

Actually I've been kind of expecting the ball to drop on AAPL for a while now. It's just so often mentioned as an obvious stock to hold in one's portfolio. Why? What further room for growth is there?

You can keep buying dongles or you can just buy a new pair of headphones with our lightnining connector, yeah we get a cut of that too. What? You still want to use your iPhone 6? Jokes on you, we sabotaged the battery from the beginning and now we're gonna software fuck your phone even though it's really perfectly good. And nah, you can't revert to early versions of iOS. But hey, I mean checkout this new $1500 phone we have or just get last years model for a measly $800. Oh your MacBook? You want it for work? Well were actually not gonna include an additional ports but we'll sell you proprietary adapters for $50-$100. I could go on and on.

I can tell you that I’m actually thinking of long term gains and this year and the next is going to perfect for scooping cheap shares of companies like SQ, AAPL, NVDA, WMT, AMZN, MSFT, GOOG. 

Current entry point is not the bottom for these stocks as we have seen huge swings in both directions. 

Been thinking about this on my way home. Given the current swings, I’m not opening any long term positions except my 45$P Sq March puts.  
Going to do just weekly get in get out calls/puts based on trend and volume. 3 day trade a week on AMZN, QQQ should be fine.

&gt; probably hedges

You know considering these are two weeks out I don't know. For once this sort of action might actually not be a hedge. I mean those contracts have deltas of like -99 or -98... Unless AAPL pops up over $170 or so and gamma starts to bring those deltas down, any gains in long stock will be almost entirely offset by losses in the long put.

$200M is a shitload but, considering these are deep ITM, extrinsic value is very small and they aren't likely to lose much of it. Maybe -50% if AAPL moves 2 std devs ($170). With $190M of leverage they could have shorted 1.28M shares, so delta of -1.28M, instead they bought almost 37k lots for a delta of -3.62M (assuming avg delta per lot of -98.5). 

I'd put money on this being a leveraged bet on its own rather than a hedge.

It is not incompatible with the above to expect small and even large rallies within that context. My bullish thesis right now is,

* AAPL just hit a 200-wk MA and is poised to bounce
* SPY just hit a 200-wk MA and is bouncing. $250 was all about validating if it's a dead cat still in search of a bottom. Today showed renewed hope that's it's something more. The price target here is as high as $263. How?
* Psychologically, it's a start of a new year. Powell is ""flexible"". Trade talks happen next week, and all it'll take is Trump tweeting an empty ""Talks were very promising. Xi and I one step closer!"" and the market could be lulled into a false sense of security. Government shutdown will end. Bearish capitulation (""I guess the recession isn't as close as I thought"") will mark the top.

You could sell decently out of the money and make maybe $70-$100 per 100 shares each month, or about $700-$1000 a month. 

Yeah, I get it, AAPL rallies and you lose your shares below cost basis, but historically Apple rallies slowly.  Historically (last ten years) most of Apple's monthly gains have been in the 1 to 8% range, so you sell covered calls at the ~10% mark and more than likely you want get assigned.  Not great, but an extra $700 a month while share price recovers isn't the worst thing.  And of course if Apple does start to recover, you can rebuy your shares.

In my opinion it was a bet on implied skew and elevated forward prices in AAPL, not on the anticipated direction of the stock.

Horace Dediu [Apple’s Unit Economics](http://www.asymco.com/2019/01/07/apples-unit-economics/)

&gt;The idea is to look at each Apple device sold as a black box that requires investment, generates revenue and, given a certain cost rate, produces a profit. Indeed the company has suggested that this is how it measures itself and has now encouraged us to do the same by withholding measurements that misdirect us away from this method.  
&gt;  
&gt;Unit sales for Apple are like unit production rate for micromobility. It’s certainly important to know how many e-scooters or e-bikes can be manufactured and deployed but it’s far more important to know how long each one lasts (lifespan) and how frequently it’s used (utilization) and what pricing can be obtained for that use or a per-mile basis.

31,2019-01-08,"Let’s take a look at your key reasons…


&gt;For instance, last quarter iPhone sales jumped 24% despite the number of iPhones sold not changing — all growth came from higher iPhone prices.

In other words, they were able to increase prices by 24% and NOT see a decline in volume. And you see that as a bad thing? Why? Companies dream of that kind of pricing power. 


&gt;Recently Apple announced that it will stop disclosing iPhone and iPad shipments.

I agree this is a bad move, but only because I like how Wallstreet overreacts to iPhone unit sales and periodically places AAPL on sale. If you’re valuing AAPL based on how many units it sold in a particular quarter, you’re looking at it wrong.

&gt;Apple has done a good job of selling digital goods (apps, movies, music, space) in its digital store, but so far it has proved to be a lousy services company.

I think that’s fair. It is frustrating how my Apple Watch only works with Apple Maps, and Apple Maps is retarded. 

&gt;Apple’s streaming music service was initially a disaster. In all fairness, it has improved, but today it is fighting an uphill battle because Apple’s walled-garden approach doesn’t allow Apple Music to work on Amazon’s and Google’s speakers. This gave plenty of breathing room for competitors, who otherwise would not have had a chance.

Apple Music was late to the show, so Im not sure I agree with your last sentence. As for the walled-garden, news just came out this morning that Apple Music and iTunes will be available on non-Apple devices. https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/08/fall-icurtain-apple-itunes-samsung-smart-tv

&gt;Then there is Siri. 

Siri is dogshit.

&gt;It needs a new huge product category. (The Apple Watch was a mildly successful product, but in the context of $265 billion of sales, it was a rounding error.) A car was supposed to be that category — it’s the largest product category globally — but, according to the New York Times, Apple has changed its car strategy several times and has basically given up on that category.

The car would have been a disaster. If AAPL had listened to Wallstreet, they would have sold TV for christ’s sake. Im glad they’ve chosen to stick with the iPhone and release add-ons like the Watch and AirPods that make it better and stickier. 

&gt;When Apple stock was lower, we did not have to worry as much about slower growth, but now we do — so we got out.

Im not here to say your conclusion is wrong, but what I will say is every one of your reasons has been around for years, so why are you selling now? If you believe it’s over priced at $150, why didn’t you sell it when it was over $200? If your analysis is really dependent on a long term outlook, rather than recent price movement, then you would have thought it was way too expensive.",Wild_Space,wallstreetbets,31.0

Will invest progressively so I don't have a target. Even if that means loading 10-15 shares at a time.

The lack of liquidity and the constant testing and rejection of 260 leads me to believe we are potentially headed for a bigger rejection. Same with QQQ vs 161. If futures open red and stay red into Monday, I think we see he beginning of a pull back down. If SPY had broken 260, I would’ve been bullish into Monday. AAPL and AMZN looked weak today. If they stay weak and open in a dump, they can pull down the rest of the market down. Of corse, if Citi releases a killer ER before open, we may get the juice needed to break through 260.

Order types, execution algorithms, and the ability to do really complex multi-asset calculations pretty much instantly. To me there are big traders, manual swing/day, HFT market makers, and then dudes like me in my little firm (just me and my friend).

I can't really speak about our main money maker, but I will point out that it's limited by its own market impact. You can move 100 shares around of AAPL and no one cares. Buy/sell 100,000 and you'll make a dent. So if you're doing lots of small stuff you by definition need to keep it small. I think in fx you can do more but that's all foreign (lol) to me. 

The good news is though that it's just work, but like years of work. It took me \~3 years to get a strategy going that can pay most of our bills (rent for the office, our home mortgages, etc). I have \~20 years of experience in software and spent thousands of hours hammering on this, and my partner is a former Chicago pit trader so he knows his shit when it comes to trading.

Other companies that have really been irresponsible borrowing to buy back stock include ORCL, AAPL, HCA, CSCO, Ford, GM, and even LB. The simple truth is, buybacks are a relatively new thing in that they were done sparsely before, and to an insane level in the last 10 years. If it was just cash on hand, that would be fine, but these companies have borrowed insane levels of debt to buy back stock. GE was buying back stock for $32/share that they could sell back now for 1/4 that. There will be consequences for this, and I think it'll reshape how buybacks are regulated in the future.

AAPL always had an outrageously high P/E, though irrelevant due to its sheer size and ability to create dominant products. For a young investor looking for high risk/high reward, I look for large drops in share price for new companies, turn-around stories, overlooked niche companies or industries, etc.. I observed $QTT from its IPO. I watched it skyrocket to $20 and drop like a bag of bricks to $4. I got in on an avg cost basis of $6/share and saw ~100% returns. Same thing with $WFT. I got in at ~$.56/share after watching and making sure that McCallum’s strategies for turn-around looked promising. Today, shares are almost at $1 and I wouldn’t be surprised if they were at $5 by this time next year.

Most of us here on WSB buy call options if we think a stock will go up because we can afford to buy a call option for $100 or $200 or whatever and then sell for $300 or $400 or whatever. But a lot of people here don't have the capital to buy 100 shares of AAPL or whatever to make a few hundred bucks. You can make money much more quickly than with stocks. But of course it has risks. You might buy a call option as a hedge because you ""shorted"" a stock, thinking it would go down, but just in case you're wrong you buy a call option.

Adderall is great for research, prep, making a gameplan and measuring your risk before the market starts.

But once it does you need to be in a calmer, more zen state. You have to be objective, flexible, and able to shift in and out between longer and shorter time frames. Adderall, once your adrenaline gets pumping, causes your lizard brain to overwhelm you. You take huge positional risks, get over confident or conversely get gripped by panic and fear. 

I'll give examples. At one point near the bottom of this market I loaded up and bought LEAPS calls on AMZN at $1400, MSFT $100, AAPL $155, and BA $300. Then a lil while later Tim Cook opened his mouth about upcoming earnings disappointments and I dumped everything. I was on adderall when I dumped and completely regretted it.

Another big problem is chasing. I was in on pot stocks earlier this year and adderall warped my view that things would keep going up forever. If a stock went down, I kept throwing more and more money at it hoping to average down and cash out big. I didn't. I got burnt.

For companies holding large amount of equity securities, earning volatility can get extreme under the new tax law.

Apart from banks, I would value most companies based on:

- Price/Operating Cash Flow
- Price/Free Cash Flow
- Enterprise Value/Operating Cash Flow 
- Enterprise Value/Free Cash Flow

Using the above metrics, BTI no longer appears that cheap, especially considering its trailing P/E ratio was artificially depressed by some one time gains:

- P/OCF = 8.2
- EV/OCF = 18.67

Now compare these numbers to FB:

- P/OCF = 16.70
- EV/OCF = 14.57

BTI’s EV is high because of its substantial debt load. Its core business is declining and its revenue is sustained by price increases. Now the US government might ban one of its key products that contributes up to 25% of its earning. 

Facebook does have its problems too, but its most recent earning shows its core business to be fully intact. Its revenue still grows at an impressive 20+% YoY, although its margin contracts due to heavy spending.

5,2019-02-10,"If you buy and sell within 30 days, you cannot deduct if net loss, it is instead incorporated into the p/l of later purchase of security. Easier to understand with an example: if you owned 100 shares of aapl and have say $1000 loss on it currently and you decide to sell all shares realizing the $1000 loss. The wash rule would apply if you repurchase aapl stock (or similar security ie aapl option) within 30 days of that initial sale. So if you bought 25 shares of aapl 20 days after realizing that $1000 loss, and decided to hold for a couple of years that initial $1000 loss would be incorporated into the p/l of that 25 share you bought; you would not be able to deduct the $1000 from the tax year it was realized. So if that lot of 25 shares netted $5,000 gain you would deduct the initial, $1,000 from the $5,000; paying taxes on a $4,000 gain. You avoid the wash rule by not buying aapl within 30 days of selling. Use this for tax purposes at end of year, and buy a stock that moves similarly to aapl (e.g., MSFT),  then repurchasing aapl once the 30 days has passed. Rule applies for options as well, trading on indices gives benefit of marked to market and avoids and wash rules. Hope this helps.",Elna_Fybbg,wallstreetbets,5.0

1,2019-02-11,"Marker makers have no directional bias in theory. They do not initiate trades. They never have to cross the bid-ask spread.  However, you and I do if we want to put on a trade.  They simply provide liquidity. And their compensation for that is you, and other speculators/hedges crossing the bid ask.  For example,  if I’m a market maker for AAPL I might make a market of bid $99.98/ ask $100.02.  In a perfect world, the number of buy order is the same as the sell orders (the same as Vegas books wanting to see the same amount of money bet on the favorite and the underdog - they can’t lose and are guaranteed to make their 10% juice). If I’m a marker maker and you and your neighbor enter opposite orders at the same time, I facilitate both of your trades because my job is to provide two-side markets and liquidity.  But, your neighbor will sell his stock to me at $99.98 and you’ll buy the same amount of shares from me at $100.02.  I took no risk - because you and your neighbor put your orders in at the same time - and made $.04.  I want to do this all day every day in a perfect world.

2,2019-02-11,"It’s not a bad way to take a position on the underlying stock.  However, for that position, you will cross the bid/ask and pay higher than what trader’s call ‘parity’.   Essentially, if am option has a 1 delta you can calculate the fair-value price by its intrinsic’ value (let’s assume its expiring that day).  There will be hardly any extrinsic value and nearly all intrinsic value.  Let’s say you own the $100 AAPL calls and stock is trading at $120...the $100 calls are worth exactly $20.  However, if you wanted to close out your position you’d have to sell the $100 calls at something like $19.80 because the market- maker will always make his bid-ask spread around theoretical or ‘fair’ value.

Turning the $1600 into $4,800 then I bought SPY, AMD, AAPL calls turning that into that $4800 into $9421 as all 3 soared. Then the next day Bush died and when the market opened on the 6th SPY/AMD/AAPL all fell down hard. Spy fell from 282 to 262, AMD from 21.26 down to 19.2 , AAPL from 181 to 171. All my tendies vanished before my eyes( for months I was pissed at myself for losing all that money as I had been working 40hrs/wk for $11). \[BTW: this all took 2 wks to do so I guess I kinda lied. but a month before I had turned $76 to $1309\] 

Then I stopped trading for a while since I didn't have the funds to go on. then on Jan.19th RH lifted my Daytrader Status and I gave my two jobs( at this point I was working for 40hr-$11+monthly bonus/ 30hr-$10.5+biwkly bonus) my 2 wk notice and I started to trade full time. But, alas I did ONE stupid trade that wiped me out by wk2 of being unemployed. So I got my last check from work  1 and my tax return and put it into the stock market bringing me to today.

Chinese look down on chinese for driving a non-foreign car, I bet its the same for green bubbles. And then Politico had that story the other day about how much Tim Cook has been meeting with trump and chinese leaders to actually keep the tariffs off of iphones.

4,2019-03-09,"So I ran over the [Dark Pool buying](https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix?) + [Smart Money Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_money_index) thing I posted [about earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ayv9hm/weekend_discussion_thread_march_810_2019/ei3jky9/). Here's an update with Friday's information. 

My process is this: I look over the list Squeeze Metrics puts out for subscribers that lists unusual dark pool buying or selling activity. If I see a name pop up a couple of times, I cross reference it with the Smart Money Index to see if the broader market confirms. 

I also sometimes check out particular names I'm interested in that don't necessarily pop up on that ""unusual acitvity"" list. SAP was one such catch. Next time I'm going to try and keep my personal/subjective picks on a separate list. 

**Lots of Dark Pool Buying + SMI trending or reversing upwards:**

1. ABB 
2. AMZN
3. BCS
4. C
5. **DWDP** (was on my previous list)
6. IVZ
7. JNUG
8. **MO** (was on my previous list)
8. MOMO (earnings this week)
9. NEM
10. **SAP** (was on my previous list)
10. SOGO
11. SRPT
12. WFC
13. **XOM** (was on my previous list)

Changes from previous list:

- Dark pool buying volume or proportion of buying for FOXA, ITUB, LLY, NKTR, NTNX, ORCL, and TSM dropped off considerably Friday. 

- RIO had an increase in dark pool selling Friday, but Thursday was also its ex-dividend date, so that may have played a role. 

**Lots of Dark Pool Selling + SMI trending or reversing downwards:**

1. BGS
2. DFEN
3. DUST
4. INGN
5. PRS
6. PRA

Notes on this list:

- CQQQ and KWEB have appeared on the ""unusual selling"" list but SMI isn't showing a confirmation. Similarly, INDL (the 3x leveraged India Bull ETF), EWW (Mexico ETF) have all had unusual selling this week, and YINN (3x China bull ETF) and EEM (Emerging Markets ETF) popped up yesterday but again the SMI isn't clear.  

- TSLA likewise has seen heavy dark pool selling these past few days but isn't being confirmed by the SMI. It's notable that before Musk's big announcement about the cheaper model 3, they were however doing lots of buying.

- IAU (gold ETF) has been on the unusual selling list a lot, but SMI isn't confirming and it seems odd that there'd be buying of gold miners and selling of miner bear ETFs at the same time. 

**Broad Sector/Index Notes:**

1. SPY: Increased dark pool buying each of the last three days
2. QQQ: Increased

Other notes:

- Last week/early this week saw lots of selling of small caps and biotech. Friday though saw heavy buying of TNA, the 3x small cap bull etf. IWM and XBI also seem to be trending upwards in regards to proportion (but not aggregate volume) of buying:selling.

- Thursday saw lots of buying in FB and selling of SQQQ. Friday reversed that, with FB seeing lots of dark pool selling and QQQ and TQQQ getting sold. 

- FANG names are mixed. AMZN, BABA, NFLX seem strong. BIDU, FB, NVDA, TSLA, and TWTR seem weak. AAPL and GOOG flat/holding steady. ",FireSail,wallstreetbets,4.0

You have gotten lucky, which is awesome and part of why we come to this sub. But be careful playing with your parent’s retirement fund. If you search, you’ll find posts on here where people took their parents retirement fund, after they had a hot streak, and blew it all.

Be careful playing with other people’s money and the money of people you care about. If I were you, I’d make it very clear to them this is extremely high risk and that you might lose it all. Then if they still want you to play with 10% of their retirement, it’s on them.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing they did to me that was a little uneasy was they stopped me from trading my spreads even at a gain(they were american, and they were apple spreads). They also stopped me from pulling out money that was actually mine, not apart of the spreads at all, from my account. Until I paid back money ""I owed"" on my open spreads? Yeah I can't say that without a question mark. The email above was them asking me to pay for 200 $320 AAPL put options.

 My account was completely frozen for about a month. I could not buy, sell, or withdraw. A lawyer from the robinhood team soon emailed me and after a few conversations with a lawyer of mine, as well, we reached a number to settle on and stayed out of the courts.

9,2019-04-03,"WSB represents a very, very small fraction of the market.  If we pooled all our resources and bought shares in AAPL, I’m not sure if we’d have much impact (today over 23 million shares traded, over $4.5 bn in value at last trade price).

Also WSB tends to get things wrong, both in direction and magnitude, quite often, so much in fact “inverse WSB” is a meme here (I’m assuming you aren’t on WSB very much).

The wisdom of the crowd will fail fundamentally due to the tragedy of the commons.  Essentially people will do whatever is best for them, even though if they continue to cooperate the overall impact to the crowd/commons, will be greater, and maybe even they would do better too if everyone kept cooperating.  So why do people act in self interest in this way?  Because they can gurantee that they gain something against the risk that enough of the rest of the crowd bails early.

Let’s say you see your holdings go up 5%, but you know anyone of the millions out there also sees the same thing, and you think “now if enough people sell I might lose money, but if we all hold maybe we get up 10%” but then you see it tick down to 4%, then 3%, then BOOM you sold, too.",Gahvynn,wallstreetbets,9.0

0,2019-04-05,"In practice, it kinda depends on market conditions. All things being equal, options with expirations further out have more theta (hence my name). This mean whatever position I’m selling farther out *should* be worth more, implying I’m gonna collect more money from selling the new positions than what I have to pay to close out my old positions. But, you have to pay attention to volatility (vega) as well. The market tomorrow might just decide, “Sorry, we’re not confident what the price of AAPL will be next week, but we’re pretty sure it’ll drop next month, etc.” ... In that case, the market might not be willing to pay me more for those new positions. Sometimes I might need to widen my credit spread by purchasing a protective call even further OTM (for less money, resulting in an overall credit from my new position). I’ve already rolled my position up and out once ... Slowly getting there, for instance my original strike was $180 and after collecting $160 in premium, my break even was $181.60.  Well, I rolled it up to a strike of $182.5 and out for a $35 credit. That brings my breakeven point up to $184.45. I also sold a put spread on AAPL (converting it into an Iron Condor) for $60, this moving my breakeven point to $185.05. I’m in no rush, my breakeven will just keep getting higher and higher. AAPL can’t keep going up forever.

Tomorrow, I’m gonna roll out my bear call spread for a credit which will 1. Buy me more time for AAPL or the markets in general to dip, and 2. Collect credit which whittles down my losses by moving up in strike my break even points ... And cause I’m feeling extra fancy, I’m also gonna sell a credit put spread on AAPL to further massage my breakeven points upward.

Once you give your picks, I usually check the MACD and RSI on the 1d chart as well as whether the pick has made an inside day. In case RSI is over 66, I usually wait since it might dip to re-test the gap fill in the past week.

So personally unless I really see AAPL climbing well over $220 I would sell these and bring in the expiration and lower the strike, but again that's just me.

Or now that these are ITM, you could hold a bit longer and if they get decently deep ITM (like delta over 0.7 maybe) start selling monthly calls against them, but you'll need AAPL to gain quite a bit more before that becomes viable.

94,2019-04-09,"The idea with long dated calls is to pay very little premium because the theta isn’t as brutal. Way OTM calls for Aapl I had at .15 are now 1.22 and they’re $220 strikes. I’ve had them a month and they never went red other than the day I opened.  View it as buying a few thousand shares at a huge discount, and not having the same downside.

Where way OTM calls screw you is front month or week because one move against you eats 50% of the value. Long dated, they only shift a few cents against you and have lower delta so if you have a high confidence a stock is poised to move, you pay less theta for every day you try to watch it play out.

What you can’t do is hold them and expect them to rocket straight line, most the time they’ll increase then pull back, repeat, and once you hit a profit target cashing out a portion is normally prudent.

I haven’t because I’ve been headlong into it since two weeks ago before their news report. They’re way below last years highs while other stocks are past it.

Yeah. Used to be a fact, but now they wont report on unit sales, so now its only a rumor.

All the institutions who got in sub 160 are now distributing to retail above 190. AAPL gonna have another big pull back soon once enough retail has come in and bought from the tutes",seank11,wallstreetbets,109.0
110,2019-04-09,"AAPL is shifting to a service revenue company, much like an economy does.  Over 85% of US teens use an iPhone...meaning they are bought into the ecosystem.  AAPL does not sell products, it sells an ecosystem where products are easy to use, designed well, and integrate seamlessly.

&amp;#x200B;

If I have a billion customers on my ecosystem (let's assume) and suddenly I charge them an additional 5 bucks a year for some core adjacent services, I can probably reasonably expect close to a 50% adoption rate.  That's an additional 2.5B in revenue.  

&amp;#x200B;

Now let's assume I'm AAPL and I know my customers spent roughly 800 on average for a new phone, 2500 for a new laptop, etc, where the margins on my hardware are maybe 20-30% at best.  Then I decide to charge for services, but since it's apple and I know my customers have money, I charge a total of, say, 15 bucks for core adjacent services.  So if I have 700M customers, and, because of the pervasive nature of my ecosystem I can assume something closer to a 85% adoption rate, I look at \~9B.  

&amp;#x200B;

An additional 9B, minimum, every year.  Which grows as my base grows.  Which allows for price drops on hardware if I have to do so in order to break into new markets, which then grows my subscriber base significantly over time.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh wow, it's EXACTLY THE SAME MODEL AMAZON USED TO GROW PRIME THEN RAISES PRICES.  It's almost like AAPL is reasonably certain this will work, especially as they flesh out their monetization push!

My plan is to wait until after earnings and wait for a good entry then buy something for July/August with a decent strike after I see what they do with earnings. 

But if I really wanted to buy an AAPL call, I'd wait for their next red day. After their most recent pump, you'll notice that the 230 strike a month or two out is up in price a little bit. Since they ended red and are currently red pre-market, you might have a good chance to get a 230 call at a decent price. I like the May 10th 230c. The delta is .0559, so I'd be looking to exit the moment it hit 205 before mid-April. If it doesn't, my next exit is around 215 by EOM April.

16,2019-04-11,"Sure thing!

My main earnings strategy is to sell far out of the money puts the day before the earnings release. The expiry I pick is the closest one to the day after earnings which will have the highest implied volatility. Implied volatility (IV) is very high right before an earnings release because the non-inside traders don't know if the stock will go up or down. It's a gamble. Some stocks are more volatile than others. Companies like $AMD or $TSLA are going to move huge while other companies like $JPM (tomorrow morning) may not move so much. The higher the IV the more money there is to be made. 

&amp;#x200B;

After the earnings release the IV drops an outstanding amount because everyone knows what has happened. This is what is referred to as ""IV crush"". For example, $BBBY had an IV of 129% before close 4/10/19 and dropped to \~50-70% on open today. You will recall from your Black-Scholes options mathematics that Vega is the relation of an options contract price to IV. Price goes up, IV goes up, price goes down, IV goes down. Basically, you can guarantee that every earnings release on every company will experience enormous IV crush. If you buy the calls or puts you're screwed by this no matter what direction you pick. If you sell a call or put you can capitalize on this IV crush by selling the contact when the premium is grossly inflated and buying it back cheap after the crush.

&amp;#x200B;

So why ""far OTM strikes""? This strategy is not foolproof. If you sell an ATM put and the stock shits (like $BBBY did today) the change in Delta (the relation of the underlying to the options contract price \[e.g. stock goes down, call price goes down, put price goes up; stock goes up, call price goes up, put price goes down\]) may cause you to lose money if the change in Delta is larger than the decrease in Vega. Remember that when you sell a put the worst case scenario is that your contact expires in the money and you are assigned and will own 100 shares per option contact on whatever stock you picked at the strike price you picked (although the stock price may drop much lower than whatever strike price you picked so you will own shares that are worth much less). If your contact expires out of the money you get to keep the premium you collected in full. The name of the game is to pick a strike that will not expire in the money. So look at how the stock moves during past earnings. $BBBY moves like 15-20%, so you need to pick a strike that can tolerate that movement and not be in the money. $LULU moves like 20% on earnings. If your strike is low enough you don't need to be too worried if the stock shits the bed 20%. 

&amp;#x200B;

When you sell puts the profit is capped so this is not yacht-making money. The return for the lower profits though is a higher probability of success which if you execute this strategy over and over again you will start to accumulate some nice wins and you can start to laugh at the people who buy calls and puts the day before earnings and lose their ass on the I V  C R U S H and that they picked the wrong direction. 

&amp;#x200B;

Below are some real trades I have made illustrating what I have described:

&amp;#x200B;

3/20/19: $MU sold to open 22 MAR 40p at 1.35 at 109% IV.

3/21/19: $MU bought to close 22 MAR 40p at 0.29 at 60% IV (1.06 profit). 

3/27/19: $LULU sold to open 29 MAR 130p at 1.62 at 135 IV.

3/28/19: $LULU bought to close 29 MAR 130p at 0.02 at 80% IV (1.60 profit).

4/2/19: $GME sold to open 12 APR 8.5p at 0.16 at 113% IV.

4/3/19: $GME bought to close 12 APR 8.5p at 0.13 at 65% IV. ($GME shit the bed. This one came close to not being profitable but it worked out for a tiny 0.03 profit).

4/10/19: $BBBY sold to open 18 APR 15p at 0.14 at 129% IV.

4/11/19: $BBBY bought to close 18 APR 15p at 0.04 at 70% IV. ($BBBY shit the bed too but the IV crush was massive too. Doesn't matter, 0.10 profit).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm all cash at the moment (aside from a small position in $REML) in preparation for $NFLX earnings on Tuesday. The 18 APR contacts are already around 69% IV and they usually trade around 35% (forecasting a 34% I V  C R U S H already!). You could sell the 18 APR 312.5p at 1.00 and tolerate a 15% drop in the stock after earnings. Not a bad buffer. After that we have $TWTR, $FB, $TSLA, $AMD, and $AAPL.

&amp;#x200B;

These God damn AAPL calls...

Came back to WSB this Monday after taking a short year old trading hiatus after losing 80k trading options. 

Only dropped a few thousand in my account to play with and told myself I wouldn't trade impulsively like I did last time. Held these god damn calls all week in hopes of making money and went from being up over 150% to being down 33%. 

If there isn't any action next week I'm going back to trading WSB's darling stock of the week with FDs. Missed out on DIS so going to have to wait another 3 years before seeing another good pikc on here unfortunately.

0,2019-05-02,"I believe it is a great idea that you are looking into investing. My initial advice to you would be as follows.

1. Diversify - this is the single most important factor in investing.
2. Make a habit of investing a small amount every pay cheque, even if it is just $10.
3. Invest for the long term, in companies that you believe would still be there 10-20 years from now.
4. Invest a portion in good, stable dividend stocks. Sometimes the yield doesn't look very attractive, but in the long run it is worth it. To support this argument, look at people who bought stocks like AAPL, F, GE several years ago. With stock splits and price appreciation (both in stock value and dividends) those people are rolling in passive income.
5. Don't take unnecessary risks by trying to trade frequently.
6. Understand investing and trading are different things, and require different type of effort and commitment.
7. If you must trade, remember the second most important rule, ""Buy the rumour, sell the news"".
8. Lastly, never, ever, under any circumstance, put more money than you can afford to lose e.g. don't use your rent money for any of this!",ExceptionallyGreat,wallstreetbets,0.0

Like is QCOM a good long or what? I think so and today at least the market agrees. Having AAPL back as a customer is a big win regardless of AAPL’s issues with maintaining growth.

What do you think about an SQ bull put spread: Jan 2020: 70p/60p for $460? SQ was at 100/share in Sept. The cashless world loves SQ. Jan 2021 gives you about the same credit, which seems silly since it's taking on an additional year. ... ?",yolo_sense,wallstreetbets,10.0
11,2019-05-03,"No no, I should have clarified.

Every one of those spreads is Jan 2021 expiry EXCEPT the 195/200 AAPL one.  That one is June 21/19, so next month.  That one I actually opened when AAPL fell from last year's ATH to around 200 and I held it through all the end of year craziness... almost closed it so many times, glad I didn't.  Got very lucky, risk averse way to handle it would have been to close it, but I must be kind of an autistic idiot if I'm here right?

The NFLX spread is 250/270 so that one is like laughing territory now.


Shorting VIX I do buy shorting VXXB, which is now renamed VXX.  I just sell em short.  Go on vixcentral.com , if that curve is steep up front you have an advantage being net short volatility.  I can explain that in a lot more detail if you're interested.",Fettywaap,wallstreetbets,11.0

So all your AAPL spreads expire next month? for full fucking credit? unreal. 
When's the NFLX expiry? Those might be risky if they're 2021. I kind of think NFLX will be at 300/share within a year or two. but wtf do i know?

14,2019-05-03,"Oh hey dude it's you!  Didn't look at the name until now.

The reason is because I don't really need the collateral, it hasn't constrained me vs any trade I've wanted to make at all.  This is my active account, which is linked to my passive account, and that account is much bigger and provides a lot of margin.  I (up until Wednesday) was using considerable margin shorting volatility (250% short maintainance requirement), and now I'm using that margin writing naked puts on high-IV stocks.  I was always doing that, but I'm doing it more now.  I think for me, right now, considering the use of cash going long and paying interest, I would rather be short puts, collecting cash, having theta on my side, and having directionally bullish trades... that *seems to be* the best use of margin to me right now.

The AMZN spreads are big - I have 4 bull spreads at 1700/1740 (was a little early on that one) and 2 at 1600/1640.  So 16K maintenance + 8K.  Credits collected there were bigger than FB, total $13K.

AAPL I have some nice ones, 25 160/165, 10 180/185, and 10 195/200 for June 2019 I'm glad I didn't panic close.

NFLX it's the same shit, they're all pretty big trades (for me).


I don't know how to format this shit, and way back when I entered these trades I wrote up a long post about it, but no one voted it or sommented on it (LOL) because it wasn't some fucking stupid OTM FD dart throw.",Fettywaap,wallstreetbets,14.0
15,2019-05-03,"wow. this is really impressive. By 'sell' i meant, you shorted a put. 

Anyways, if your max profit is 8k on FB spread, and you're already at 5k, why not buy back the shorts and sell the long puts to free up collateral? Same with AMZN and AAPL? 
What was the collateral that you needed for your AMZN spread?",yolo_sense,wallstreetbets,15.0
16,2019-05-03,"I didn't sell it.  

I sold 15 150P leaps for Jan 2021
I bought 15 140P leaps for Jan 2021

Total credit was $8K, total risk is $7K.  Max payback if under my low strike is $15K.  Bull put spread.

Unrealized I'm already up huge but I'll of course ride it out.  Think I'm up about $4-5K, some days these leaps don't trade so the prices can be stale at my broker.


I opened even bigger ones on AMZN, AAPL and a similar sized one on NFLX and SPY around the same time.  Total credit in was maybe $50K?  They are all in max profit position with a lot of breathing room.

Not to mention I've already stated I think $EA is overvalued as of today, so if AAPL bought them I would say AAPL got a bad deal even using a hostile takeover method (about $7bil too much) and if they priced in a 10-20% premium ($100-$110/sh) as is standard when trying to aggressively negotiate a good deal, I'd say they overpaid by up to $11.5bil.

16,2019-05-09,"To anyone bitching about /u/sorefreshing.

In the business I work in, information can be classified as “this is how we do it” and “this is for reference only”.

If you’re doing a task that is repetitive and highly standardized, let’s say installing a part on an vehicle, you have a “this is how you do it” document.

Then let’s say you are doing something that isn’t perfectly defined, let’s say you’re trying to root cause a problem.  For this you have educational or guiding material, or what I would call “this is for reference only”.  This isn’t telling you what to do, just something to consider.

Sorefreshing posts are just that.  Showing you what to consider and how to play it.

When you open a position, it’s your responsibility, 100%.  The strikes, the expirations, the type of option(s), when you open, if you close it to prevent total lose, if you close to lock in gains.  It’s all on you.

People need to stop complaining about him, or he’s going to leave, and I wouldn’t blame him.  There are a couple users here I see “that was sorefreshing kiss of death lolol” come on.  He even said this week was a wild card.  If anyone told you AAPL would be sub $200 this week, or MSFT lower than pre-ER, or ROKU would be up 20%+ or any number of big movements we’ve seen you would’ve said no fucking way last week.

But let's go even further and assume those vegetarians get addicted to BYND and buy 10 packages per month. That's 50 billion in revenue. Now if we assume that 1 billion health-conscious carnivores also decide to munch on a single pack of BYND every month, that's another \~70 billion in revenue.

Also, none of those patents (nor the many trade secrets) stolen by Huawei would be considered patent trolling. They stole key technologies that were in daily use, and were not even close to their expiry dates. Those are legitimate complaints and criticisms -- just look at the MU vs Fujian Jinhua / UMC case... absolutely blatant theft of IP and trade secrets, and China's courts slap an injunction on MU products? Lmfao.       
     
Regarding the security threat thing, modern telecom equipment is by it's nature a security threat. The only reason Huawei is getting hit for that is due to their history of aiding (and legal requirement to aid) the Chinese government in espionage.

For example, I'll unpack the idiocy jumbled into:     
     
&gt; Sounds like they just headhunted some former micron employees for their knowledge. Trade theft? Sounds just like normal business to me. The 3 individuals charged are all Taiwanese, not even Chinese.      
     
1. So, you're saying GOOG can poach AAPL employees and has free reign to duplicate iOS? Cool story, bro.     
2. Yes. It's definitely trade theft, also IP theft because the tech itself was patented.    
3. Normal business? ...maybe in China it is. No other developed country would allow that.    
4. You must not be familiar with the Tawain-China relationship. Lol. Try telling Xi that China doesn't own Taiwan. When WWIII happens, it may likely be started by the US backing Taiwan's separation from China.       
         
And, no, you don't have to take the US government's word for anything. [NYT exposed the theft](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/technology/china-micron-chips-theft.html) with plenty of details.        
     
Also, of course Fujian is going to deny it. That's just stupid. Further, UMC accused Micron of stealing a tech that Micron used before UMC ever existed. That's how preposterous that case is. As I said earlier, China hides their IP theft behind their absurdly unfair kangaroo courts. US companies have recognized this and often don't even bother suing blatant IP infringers anymore -- especially because even if the US company miraculously wins a case in China, the Chinese company just shit's down for a week and then resumes operations under a new name.

38,2019-06-04,"Some useful lingo

**General:**

FDs: Faggots Delights. Generally refers to short term, extremely OTM options that have a very low chance of ever going ITM. Basically only bought by poor autists who like gambling (most of this sub), loses money 90% percent of the time except for that one guy who gets 300% return and encourages more retards to buy in.

DD: Due Diligence. Basically research/investment thesis for a stock play. DO NOT LISTEN TO DDs on WSB. 99% you'd be better off inversing. Note: SoRefreshing and a few others who actually know what they're doing might be an exception, although blindly copying others is also a good way to lose money.

**Stocks**

ATH: All time high. If you want to buy puts at this point, you're retarded. If you want to buy calls at this point, you're probably also retarded.

Leverage: Use small money to make big money. Except it generally fails because only poor and stupid people do it.

Margin: Borrowing money. See above.

Bid/Ask: How much you're willing to pay vs how much people are willing to sell for. Limit orders set a limit for bid/ask while market orders basically leave everything up to robinhood. Don't be that guy who places a market order and complains when it isn't filled optimally. You'll look retarded.

**Options**

Call/Put: The right to buy/sell 100 shares of a certain stock at a certain price

Strike Price: The price mentioned above. The further away it is from being ITM, the less the option is worth.

ITM/ATM/OTM: In the money, at the money, and out of the money. If exercising your option would instantly net you some cash, it's In The Money and you're either insanely lucky or rich as hell. If it literally wouldn't do shit because the strike price is the same as the stock price, it's At The Money. If exercising it would make you one of the most retarded people on earth because you're literally gifting away cash, it's Out of The Money.

Expiration Date: Your time limit. The closer it is, the less the option is worth.

Exercise: Exercising the right mentioned above. You probably aren't going to exercise shit because you're poor, so you don't need to worry about this. Just sell your options. If one of your options are exercised against you however, you're probably kinda fucked.

Shorting an option: Selling an option to another person. Generally a bad idea if you don't know what you're doing cause you can lose more than you have; 1r0nyman is a good example. However if you do know what you're doing, it's a more consistent way to make money because shorting theta tends to work well given that it inherently inverses all the autistic plays made on this sub.


IV: Implied Volatility. How much you expect the stock to move. Stocks with high IV have more expensive options. For example: who expects AAPL to drop a shit ton in the next week? Not too many people, it's not really likely unless China bitchslaps them back across the Pacific. TSLA, on the other hand, could randomly drop 30 points after Musk randomly tweets about Catgirls again and gets smacked by the SEC, so there's a decent chance you could make money with a put there. Because the stock is more volatile, options are worth more.

**Options Strategies**

Spreads: Lame-ass shit you only do because Robinhood forces you to. Limits risk and reward by buying/selling similar types of options, so not great if you want to gamble like everyone on this sub. If you gain money overall, you've got a short credit spread. If you spend money, you have a long debit spread. Credit spreads are good on stocks with high IV.

Straddles/Strangles: If you think a stock will move but don't know what direction because you're an indecisive retard who can't predict how the market will work and are too lazy to hedge in an intelligent manner, this is for you. Basically you buy both a call and a put so no matter what way it moves, you win. Except not really, because the market will trade sideways and fuck you over.

Iron Condor: Basically the opposite of the previous strategy where you short a call and put spread so that you get credit but get fucked if the market moves significantly up or down. It seems like a good consistent strategy until you realize you're either risking $100 to make $20, or you're selling options on a stock like TSLA which moves ridiculous amounts and is essentially impossible to predict.

In Conclusion: GTFO back to r/investing and put your money into an ETF. Sell covered calls if you're a pussy.",afieryfate,wallstreetbets,38.0
0,2019-06-06,"To be honest, I am leaning towards Case 1 and 2 for this current situation. There is no denying that the market is bound to recover now (every market recovery starts with a random spike up), but here's my rationale for my opinion on this issue. FYI I am currently holding calls at this moment:

* **Mexico tariff goes into effect**

Yes, we have all heard it. Mexico will be paying for that damn wall and Trump will ensure that will happen. With re-elections coming in 2020 and with assurances to Trump that ""rates cut will be justified depending on circumstances"", it's extremely certain that Trump will be emboldened to continue with his aggressive trade policy with other countries in order to get what he wants. Feds dropping rates will help to wane off any temporary economic slowdown, and Trump needs the stock market and the economy on his side ASAP before he becomes another one-term president.

* **The market goes down,** ***but high volatility expected***

Now, this is where things get interesting. Mexican tariffs are expected, and this will probably cause a few red days before everything corrects itself. Those who have bought puts may count their blessings, although it will be extremely difficult to time this market and you risk losing your capital overall. However, the Feds will be inclined to take a more aggressive stance from here on out (they lost their patience stance in the previous episode) and everything will start to hail under Newton's Third Law of Motion.

China tariff committee will commence on June 17, Feds speech will be on June 19 and Trump meeting Xi at the G20 meeting summit is somewhere around late-end June. Tariff committee will likely list several hot industries to target (smartphones, laptops, technology and software) for the remaining $300B Chinese exports and this will ultimately see the downfall of numerous high-tech stocks (looking at ya, AAPL MSFT and NVDA). People might be inclined to hold puts then, but hold your horses - **you don't ever bet against the Feds**. 

* **Fed cuts rate**

Feds will likely announce a rate cut OR voice a more aggressive stance towards a rate cut (which admit it, this recession is over). Huge chaos will ensue once more (Fed talks v. China tariffs) just like now (Fed talks v. Mexico tariffs), but the market trend will still be upwards (technical rebound, fundamentals will change from here on out). This will be the final blow towards the recession, as Trump meeting Xi amidst the chaos to if not resolve the trade war, **at least propose to hold a meeting for further discussion**. This will be the icing on the cake, and even if Chinese talks stall - the Feds are bound to drop rates by then (July, 70%).

*So, what does this tell us?*

1. A bear market is not as strong as we perceived it to be. Trade wars will come, yes, but Trump is running out of time and it is apparently clear that China intends to stall talks if they don't have it their way.
2. Even if a trade war and a recession do happen (unlikely), the Feds will be prepared for this event and will take drastic and radical measures to help combat the economic slowdown.
3. The market has been oversold for a while now. Sales and profits are still driving this market and a SPY crash grows increasingly uncertain over time.
4. That being said, **do not go havoc and buy calls immediately**. This market has yet to recover, and while tough days are going to be no more, there are still a few traps that people may accidentally fall into. We have so many good days ahead of us.

0,2019-06-07,"Actually it is a lot more complex than just the futures. These big fund managers use future contracts as a ""hedge"" for the most part but the futures can also indicate general market sentiment before cash open. 

They buy or sell indexes like XLF(financials), SMH(Semiconductors), XLT(Technology) which are the three key indexes that directly affect price of SPY. Then they can also buy sell one of the monster constituents of SPY individually to affect SPY price. SPY has 500 stocks, but it is not equal weighted. BA, AMZN, AAPL, FB, MSFT, GOOGL are one of the biggest constituents by market cap. If someone wants to tank SPY, selling one or two of these stocks so they are down a lot for one day will directly affect SPY and prevent it from rallying, even causing it to go red. Same applies for financials XLF. In order for a perfect SPY rally to happen, financials techs and semis should all run. Then there is the whole bond market, example ETF would be TLT. If those rally, financials tank and thus SPY tanks. 

Market makers always hedge and have neutral positions so they make money on either case. Correct, options pricing does not fluctuate based on how many options contract are bought. Options pricing depends on the usual underlying stock's implied move (IV), stock price and expiry. But when market tanks, and volatility picks up it juices up the options pricing.",uninfinity,wallstreetbets,0.0

I absolutely agree. To add, many companies simply won't adjust their supply chains because they don't see tariffs as permanent. They're currently viewed as a negotiating tactic. Why move a multi-million or multi-billion dollar facility if it's likely these tariffs will be gone in 6 months or a year.

7,2019-06-09,"I really can't say at this point. Dark pool stuff operates on a longer time line, it's used as a way for institutions to quietly accumulate or distribute shares without moving bid/ask spreads and forcing the price in a certain direction. So maybe if we see another week or two of sustained selling it's more bearish. I personally just keep it in the back of my mind within the greater context of things. I'll probably be more quick to take profit if I'm day trading or put in smaller position sizes if I wanna play calls or puts, but don't have the confidence to go heavy on either (by contrast, was buying AAPL and AMZN dips because the data said there was strong price support).",FireSail,wallstreetbets,7.0

Institutions are selling off AMD (not unusual after a big pop/strong run), BABA, SPLK, KSS, and KMX. 

Buying has been a bit contradictory. GDX, USO, and TLT have all had recent accumulation. You see XLU, XLB, and SPLV (low vol) being bought up right alongside QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, CSCO, and AMZN.

10,2019-07-01,"Good question.

If you are willing to buy a contract that says that AAPL is going up to 205 by next week, that means that someone is willing to sell a contract (meaning that someone is betting against you). The guy selling it is hoping it doesn’t go to 205 and to him the profits go. 

You mentioned “the house.” It’s not like Blackjack (where the house is the casino, and you either win or lose against it). But it is like poker? Have you ever played poker (against other players) in a casino? The players bet against each other and the house collects a certain amount from each hand in exchange for letting the bettors play there. So in the case of options, you’re playing against other bettors and the broker (house) charges you a small fee just to make your bet.

Now, if you’re interested, there is another level. The  brokers merely allow you to play, but almost all derivatives like options go to central clearing houses where bets are paired with partners. There is not literally one guy who is betting against you, but a set of guys who think AAPL will go down and a set of guys who think it will go up and the clearing house plays matchmaker. These guys are an essential middleman— they make sure people pay up.

Everybody here and their sister has a serious swooning infatuation with Robinhood, which offers commission-free options. Personally, I would rather fork out a few bucks to an established broker so I have don’t have to deal with the (albeit rare) situation that their system is down and you can’t sell your contract.

Hope that makes sense.",SetzerWithFixedDice,wallstreetbets,10.0

43,2019-07-08,"It’s a 2% tax on wealth you have over $50 million, and another 1% on wealth over $1 billion.  My guess is 1 or 2 of us here would be impacted (if the people are telling the truth, which to be honest I don’t really care if they are or not).

The most detailed proposal I saw exempted your primary residence (presuming up to a certain dollar value, but it didn’t specify) and your 401(k).

So if you had a TDA (or RH account) with over $50 million in AAPL or AMZN or MSFT or whatever, then each year you’d need to shell out $1 million a year.  Lately those companies have managed to do that, but you would need to sell shares, find cash elsewhere, or maybe write options against those shares to make sure you could cover it.

Supposedly it’s to help ensure that people with extreme wealth pay “fair” taxes.  We can argue fairness and equality on other subs, but from what I can see it would incentivize you to make sure that money makes decent returns… or to hide it even harder.

Compliance would likely be challenging overall, people would find ways to have homes/boats/planes/whatever by difficult to track entities, but trading accounts would be easy as they already report holdings/gains/losses to the government.

The proposals that would actually impact WSBers is the tax per transaction some senators have proposed.  Maybe 0.5% of the total value of each transaction.  Let’s say you buy $10k worth of call options expiring in a week because you think it’s going up big.  Then they drop to $1k a day later, you sell.  You pay $50 the first time, then $5 when you close the position.  Or you’re a baller and you buy $1,000,000 in shares, so that’s $5,000.  Then a year later shit went up like 1% and is now worth $1,010,000 but you’re tired of holding so you unload it, but that costs you $5,050.

1,2019-07-10,"Yes. I did this a lot in December / January / February, and it worked out fine, buuuuut....

1) Okay so I had a lot of cash in my account, AAPL was at 170, and I told myself I wouldn't mind owning it at 165. Cool. Sell weekly put at 165. Option expires worthless. Free money!

2) Next week, repeat! AAPL gets close to 165. Nice! I might own this thing and sell a call against it! Whooops! AAPL now at 160. Hey wait - I'm buying a lot of these shares at 165... oh well... I'll take 'em.

3) Time to sell more puts at lower strikes. I'll sell a call at 170 against those shares I just got assigned. Hey wait a minute... AAPL is now at 160, not 165... those premiums for 170 aren't looking as good as I thought they might. Oh well. I'll sell 'em anyways.

4) Fuck. AAPL down to 150. I just got assigned more stock than I ever wanted to own, and meanwhile, any options with premium worth a damn would be taking a major loss.

5) Okay. So I waited... and you know the story... AAPL is now back at 200. I sold calls along the way, slowly getting back out of it, some at the same price I got assigned, some slightly lower, some slightly higher.

Did I make money in the end? Yes... I did... A lot? Nope. I would have done better getting assigned, not worrying about selling calls on the way up, and just letting it all go at 180 / 190. I didn't do that. Oh and btw... before I made it all back, I was shitting bricks, as I was down a LOT.

Are you missing something? Not in terms of mechanics, but keep in mind the stock doesn't typically close conveniently right at your strike. You'll either walk away w/ premiums and no shares... or shares... at a value lower than your strike.

I have since modified my strategy, and I've had much better results. I still mostly sell options. I rarely buy them. If I ever buy them, it's just a gamble for shits &amp; giggles. It's like a blackjack bet to me that has a chance of paying way better than 1:1 but will likely lose.

I still sell puts. Lots. I just sell them further out of the money than I used to, and I sell calls against the same stock. It's mathematically impossible for both to go tits up. If a stock starts to run in the wrong direction, whichever that might be, I cover quickly. I have made what I consider to be a dickload of money doing this, but I don't think I'm some kind of pro or anything... I don't think it's luck either. I think it's a strategy that works all the time except for when it doesn't. Then ""when it doesn't"" part, as I see it, are some kind of system shock: terrorist attack, accounting fraud, leaked numbers, etc. I purposely don't sell options near earnings... so it's some kind of odd event that would fuck me. While those happen rarely, when they do, things get fucked. On the flipside, if a company acquires one of the companies I'm short calls against, well fuck. So that's where the game is dangerous.

If you just want to be prudent and sell some puts against stocks you were planning to buy anyways, that makes sense. Your worst case there is that the stock runs up, you get some premiums, but you never get to enjoy the run of owning the stock. Hope that helps. Good luck.",hungarianhc,wallstreetbets,1.0

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry, I had to, this is WSB!

&amp;#x200B;

In all seriousness, I understand the question. 

&amp;#x200B;

A different fact you might ask next given your first question, and other than what's been provided that might be helpful:

&amp;#x200B;

\- When you buy a put or a call, that sucker will lose money until the second it expires, even if it's moved in your favor. Think of an option as a brand new Ferrari that will be either 'damaged' or completely totaled in X (insert # days to expiration) days, guaranteed.

&amp;#x200B;

\- When you buy a put or a call, you can do 1 of a few things. Let's say you buy a Call on $QQQ on a Monday, expiring the Friday 4 days in the future for our example.

1. Sell at any time during market hours, for hopefully a profit, and hopefully on the same day you bought it. Overnight options is for insane people, except I've had my best trade ever on an overnight $AAPL Call, of course.
2. Hold it overnight. Again, this is for crazy people. I do not know how anyone who wants to win consistently has the stomach to do this. You guys are all insane.
3. Roll it. You can essentially sell your call and buy one for that expires another time further in the future at the same time. Someone who does that can explain more - I don't do it, I understand the concept but I am in and out of trades within the same day, so I never would need to roll.
4. Hold it until expiration. I would say, don't do this, also, if you're doing this, you're in 1 of a few situations:
   1. You've got a solid winner, and you want to buy the stock. If you hold an ITM option at expiration, your broker will exercise it for you - you'll own those shares (100 x number of option contracts x price of stock). Now, I'm guessing that most brokers alert users who don't have the proper funds to exercise an option so they can sell it, and I'm also guessing that if you can't afford the shares, the brokerage will likely sell the option on your behalf - never happened to me - anyone? What happens here?
   2. You can't / couldn't sell the option. Crazy shit went down and you couldn't sell the option. This is probably because shit went tits up and it's no longer liquid, so no one is buying your garbage, worthless option with 3,4 days to go! When this happens, nothing you can do, really. Just keep an order on and hope someone takes the bid.
   3. It's definitely expiring worthless. Here, you've either just fucked up and decided your stop loss to be at -99.99%, or you ran your bid down on your garbage trade so low that Friday sucks the last 2 cents off the price.",WhipTheLion,wallstreetbets,3.0

FB Cup and Handle Formation update July 12th: [https://imgur.com/STfVamD](https://imgur.com/STfVamD)

The depth of the cup was around 40-50 points. In my opinion we are just getting started with FB's push. Last earnings they completely crushed!

Measured Price Prediction: $250 EOY

**APPLE:**

[AAPL Cup and Handle Ready to go!](https://imgur.com/bAvXGxP)

IMHO, AAPL is ready to leg up back to ATH and beyond. Macroeconomic conditions might produce a 50-50 earnings, but AAPL's move to services is very smart.

Measured Price Prediction:  $235 EOY. The cup depth is actually 70 points, so from pure TA perspective $270, but it seems very very unrealistic.

With that amount of capital you could sell monthly or quarterly calls on something like $AAPL and collect close to $2-300,000 annually.

2,2019-08-05,"That’s where the reductions in buy backs don’t compute for me.  I gotta look into this to see the contribution of the return on their cash holdings on earnings ( for both BRK and AAPL), which,  even at 2-3% may be sensible/necessary to hit guidance on the next earnings call.  But that’s a choice not to invest in growth, which means they have no vision or they are scared or just milking shit to get through the call.  This is how CSCO and a lot of big tech played the last downturn and they emerged largely irrelevant (and shrinking) in the face of new competition but still felt like winners and collected huge bonuses as their stock price caught the updraft of a bull market with no top-line growth but buy-backs driving growth in EPS which the hustlers on both the buy and sell side could earn bonuses hocking to dumb money index fund buyers.   A crack house is also full of happy customers.  But they smoke crack.  

I like the Buffet, but he’s not putting his money where his mouth is.  He either buys consistently and believes in the sanctity of the market long term, or he times the shit, raising cash for bargains.   Seems like the latter to me.   It it’s one quarter.  He sees shit I don’t.  But he also cheerleads.  So who the fuck knows.",mrmoneymoron,wallstreetbets,2.0

20,2019-08-04,"Let me know if I’m misunderstanding your question, but as far as I’m concerned, they’re only delta hedging for the purposes of remaining delta neutral with regards to the linked underlying asset. So, for example, if an issuer were to issue structured notes with options linked to the performance of AAPL, the issuer would be short both OTM knock-in puts and ATM digital calls. In order to remain delta neutral, the issuer would then be long a certain number of AAPL shares. This is done so that the issuer neither loses nor makes money regardless of how the structured note performs (whether the note gets called early, matures, or triggers the knock-in put won’t matter; the issuer is hedged against all scenarios). So yes - if the “yield on the index” refers to the performance of the underlying - the issuer would indeed be hedging against that.

If we assume the issuer profits from risk-free investments such as short-duration treasuries, we can safely assume zero or negligible credit risk (because the risk of the US defaulting is basically zero). If you’re talking about hedging against the issuer’s own risk of default as a creditor, then I don’t really have a good answer for you, though I would say that it lies outside the scope and extent of the risks of and considerations for issuing structured notes.

Interest rate risk (I’m assuming we’re talking about treasuries here) is present, though it would be offset if we also assume short-duration bills are held until maturity.

As for structuring liquidity for potentially unexpected early calls... I honestly don’t know. Still super new to this subject so I’m still learning things as I go; to say that I even have the basics down would be overly generous. Again, I’m not even sure if some/most of what I’m saying is even correct... most of it’s just my best educated guess.",AbsurdistSpeculator,wallstreetbets,20.0

***Commentary:***

As expected, large outflow on Friday: $3.1bn left the SPY ETF fund on Friday. 

Thesis remains unchanged from my posts on previous days, but obviously with SPY going from 300 to sub 290 in 3 sessions we run risk of silly pops to the upside for no reason. 

I would only advise buying puts if you want to capture the move between today and next two weeks, rather than trying to navigate the chop we're gonna experience from day to day. Not advocating buying at open today unless you can stomach seeing -50% before seeing +100%. No earlier expiries than 08/23.

We're in exactly the same situation as in May. Fed meeting at the end of April, Trump unhappy with Fed, Trump restarts trade war to push fed. Back then we just had a slew of great earnings, mood was fantastic. This is also where we are today. Fun fact - SPY **dropped 1% or more only on 8 days this year. Four of those were in May (7th, 13th, 23rd and 31st)** due to non-dovish fed and a new round of tariffs on China.

***Thesis:***

Not to repeat myself, my thoughts are summarised in the thread linked below and linked comments.

&amp;#x200B;

***Risks:***

* Last time, Fed responded to Trump's tantrum by making a 180 degree from ""no case for hike or cut"" to ""will use all tools to sustain the expansion"" and fucked all bears. It was after we drew down 7% over the course of May though.
* Trump swallows pride and cancels the 10% $300bn Tariffs
* Main bull case: market ignores everything and goes up anyway (we're gonna have days when it'll look like this is materialising but you just gotta have iron hands)
* ??? - something that I haven't thought of

***Haters:***

* **if you're so smart let me see your positions!** [I made 320% on Thursday with 08/07 288 SPY puts](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ckttck/320_profit_15k_on_287ps/), closed them, and used the money to pay off a loan I took out in June after I got fucked by ""sustain the expansion"" comment from Powell. I thought he meant ""if things get bad"" but market thought he meant ""even if SPY hits 300 we cuttin' baby!"" and I pissed away 40k. I took out 25k loan to cover some of my planned expenditure like holidays until I get paid approx 200k post tax bonus in April.

Gonna dump some fucked $CRM calls at open and exchange ‘em for $QCOM puts. Thinking a $69 strike for the meme and an 8/16 expiry because I’m sensible.

**Bear thesis:** ~65% of Qualcomm’s revenue cane from China in 2018/1H19, which makes it the third-most China exposed company in the S&amp;P 500 (measured by total sales in China). The yuan just got devalued, making US goods relatively more expensive, thus jeopardizing QCOM’s China sales revenue. In addition, this dumb shit ain’t over yet - it’s more likely than not that Mango Man will ramp up the intensity of his tariff tantrum in one way or another.

But why QCOM and not other China-exposed firms like AAPL, MU, or SWKS? For that, I’m turning to technicals. Of the small handful of China-exposed companies, only QCOM is not oversold/near oversold and/or holding support. Rather, QCOM is getting rejected off its 100 day SMA. Plus, put premiums on QCOM aren’t as atrociously expensive (i.e. IV is low) compared to the others.

**TL;DR QCOM $69 puts for 8/16 because trade war is bad for US semis/tech, and worse for QCOM.**

These kind of bets have previously gotten people hosed because they have the same mentality as other retards where they can potentially make a quick dollar but it goes against them and they get assigned.

10,2019-09-11,"So NFLX is barely profitable at +$10 per month subscription and Apple is going to start a new service for less than half the cost? While both companies compete and bid to buy movies and tv shows.

I think the growth assumptions in NFLX's price are now even more stupid crazy high. PE +100? lol. (even if they didn't lose subscribers to competition (big if) NFLX's stock price is pricing future price increases which are now much harder to do as they cost double the competition already). 

Also it seems very likely Apple's streaming service will run at a loss at $5 per month. Assuming they take growing and running this service seriously, I don't see how they are close to making the numbers work as is. Looking at NFLX for insight into costs at scale, NFLX has costs of ~$8 per subscriber per month, even if Apple eventually raises prices and can do some things more efficiently, this service seems like it's a cost not a source of profit for now. EVEN if they Apple reached NFLX size in a few years. NFLX only makes $1Billion a year, AAPL makes $55Billion...so maybe eventually if Apple can create and grow this service and raise prices and be more efficient they might add 2% to the bottom line? 

I have no position in DIS but they seem to be positioned best here. Though the stock isn't cheap even if they win the streaming wars 2020s...So I rubbed my crystal ball and the random trade generator says...

Current thoughts:

COST is slightly up ah, but based on today's movement it seems like a good buy.  Will wait until Friday either way. Same for McD.

Staying away from CRWD until Eod Friday when I'll get a tiny portion of fd's to sell on Monday, hoping for a pop ofc.

AAPL added ultra wide band to iPhone 11 and the Watch. It’s worth researching. It will lead to AAPL’s next service and hardware stack. When the Apple tracker is announced later this year, it will house the U1 chip. Sounds trivial because it needs more development before medical device applications. Apple has done this before with the W1 Bluetooth chip. It’s the heart of AirPods. 

Look into the U1 chip Apple did not discuss. It will be basis for a new product category and AAPL is moon bound. I bought $10k in 2020 calls looking for $235 within a year. But this isn’t investment advice! Just nerd talk about ultra wide band applications.",eavesly,wallstreetbets,30.0

But I also had puts and made over 100% on those, so ultimately I won on my SPY plays even though I had a lot of calls that lost money. Trick is trying to time buying low and selling high, so if SPY just went up a bunch, buy puts, if it just went down a bunch, buy calls, because in both instances they're cheaper than they were. Doesn't ALWAYS work but I also use them more as hedges, especially puts since I usually have a lot of call positions for stocks I believe in.

9,2019-10-02,"Repo is short for repurchase agreement. Essentially a repo is a short term loan, usually overnight, with very low interest rates. If a bank/dealer has extra cash sitting around, they can lend that cash out in exchange for securities to make a tiny profit.

So imagine you are a security dealer with an inventory of securities and you have no cash. You can go to the repo market and borrow cash in exchange for some of your securities. Because it is a “repurchase” agreement, you are agreeing to buy back those securities tomorrow when you have the cash at slightly more than you sold them for today.

Recently, lots of companies have been turning in securities and there isn’t enough cash to loan to all of them so the Fed has been adding cash to the pool.

A simple example: You have cash right now and I need cash because I just got margin called and my account is empty. A repo is me giving you my AAPL share for $100 today and agreeing to buy it back at $99 tomorrow. So you make money and I get the cash I need right now.",NotoriouslyComplex,wallstreetbets,9.0

20,2019-10-02,"Because Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) represents how far the underlying is dislocated from where it has been in the recent past. If you're using robinhood obviously you won't be able to use this indicator, but get on a real trading platform and set up a MACD. It's my favorite indicator and really the only one I pay attention to besides general price action and candles. I've found that this indicator is most useful looking back 20 days and using 1HR candlesticks, and only buying when there's been high amounts of Vol. and a ranging market. This strategy really only works well on stocks that have enough volatility for the indicator to be useful.

&amp;#x200B;

Example; As of this writing, MACD on AAPL going back 20 days with 1HR candlesticks suggests that the selloff will more than likely turn around. There's pretty solid support at the 219ish area that it's bounced off of 4 times in the past 20 days. With that being said, ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN, DON'T OVEREXPOSE YOURSELF! October is historically a very volatile month and if you were to buy a call now, trump could come out and say ""no deal, forward with tarriffs"" and your call would be down 20-50%. Remember, even if the market starts to go up and your call gets closer to the money, Volatility is dropping and the clock is ticking. If the position hasn't moved in the green by the end of the second or so week, dump it and see where you went wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, learning how to properly hedge a bet is very important. Using a good hedge to minimize losses is paramount in continuing your upward trajectory. The worst thing a trader can do is become overconfident and overexposed, it sets you up for blowing up your account or worse; desperate, revenge trading, the ""I'll claw my losses back motherfucker"" type of mentality. Been there, done that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Final note; Don't put too much stock in TA, I would venture to guess that statistically speaking even using the indicators in the most disciplined manner would elevate your odds of winning to SLIGHTLY better than chance.

Also loaded up on 10/11 $132 $DIS calls when it was in the red. Sold my $AAPL calls later in the day when it kept on floating around $230 for ~130% profit and switched to 10/11 222.5 puts. Sold those when they reached 70% profit. Also bought some 10/11 $265 $MA puts and 10/11 $86 $SBUX puts. Sold my $SPY calls when we got above 295 for about 60% profit and switched to 10/11 $293 $SPY puts. Sold those EOD for a hair under 115% profit.

You make more money on long calls relative to buying puts for the same % change in stock price.

Take bigger risk = swing trade at the end of Thursday on weekly calls with low IV that expire the next day, but on companies with high APTR (average percentage true range), large body candles (check ThinkScript on Thinkorswim for that) low option IV, but high standard deviation on the underlying stock returns. 

Stay small initially, so that if you lose... double down, keep going cuz sooner or later, you'll win: triple down, quadruple down, quintuple, sextuple, septuple down, etc.... and keep watching IV cuz it increases when stocks fall...

Today you would have made up to around 8x on SPY calls, and about 8x on AAPL calls. You just need to hit one of those bud, so stick to swing trading at the end of the weekly options! Best of luck!",goingmyway,wallstreetbets,2.0

21,2019-11-02,"market is too irrational. watch it soar to new ATHs that only CNBC's talking heads can justify. any time it drops the fed comes in to save the day. Trump trade cycle is over. trade war was a distraction. so is the impeachment news that has taken front seat over the economic front, which will lead up to 2020 election. wtf is an inverted yield curve? wtf cares is what.

asset prices will continue to rise beyond reasonable means. largest US tech companies, AAPL, MSFT, etc. will continue with absurd stock valuations because this is the true economy in their minds -- the continued enrichment of the ultra wealthy and the elimination of the middle class, so long as the fed serves the mandate of full employment. it'll just keep printing money as the fuel and engine of the Trump economy. 

where it was once the norm for twenty-year-olds to buy housing and begin adult lives at adult ages, living with mom and dad has become normalized and will only get worse. they say they will move out when housing prices drop, when pay increases and real jobs can be had outside of almost pure influence. after inflation, the median US salary in the 50s - 70s is equal to something like $40 / hour today. the going wage (even when economy argues that wages are high) is $16 - $18? not factoring in the increased cost of living, asset prices, student loan obligations, etc. I don't see millinials moving out from their parents' houses any time soon, or reverting to previous norms. housing affordability is not limited to the US by any means. 

if all bubbles pop, what pops this obvious bubble -- the largest US economic expansion in history? This expansion also includes the largest homeless population in US history, which wasn't at all usual less than a decade ago. Now there are tent cities and skid rows in every major US city that people enjoy ignoring.

is the trump economy the last straw that leads to US socialism, from which we are already hearing the cries of? when debts can't be repaid and government doesn't have the money due to massive deficits and exhaustive fed money printing, the remaining idea is wealth redistribution from the ultra wealthy. is Bezos going to start handing out checks at no cost? he is currently working on bringing visions of establishing low orbit space colonies where people work and vacation as secondary ecosystems (blue origin mission). that's how much fucking money these people have.

7,2019-11-04,"Here's the short version (still long)

1.  He had 2k in RH

2. This allowed him 2k in margin from RH gold

3.  He used this to buy 100 shares of AMD

4.  He sold an ITM call for 3k (or something)

5. (KEY POINT). RH thinks he has 7k (2k margin), but he does not.  The original 4k will be needed when he gets assigned.  Those calls are ITM with a strike of $2 or something.

6.  Now that RH thinks he has 7k, he can borrow another 3k.  Combined with the 3k from selling the call, he has 6k.

7.  He buys more AMD and sells a call and gets his margin cap increased over and over until he has 12,000 AMD shares selling 120 covered calls.  And now he can borrow (somehow) more margin

8. He YOLO's all the borrowed money on AAPL puts which drop and he is immediately margin called.

9.  RH sells everything for loss and is still negative. (A margin call)

25,2019-11-03,"Here are the bits you might have heard:

Tard used a loophole to get 25x leverage on AAPL puts on earning day. 

Breaking that down:

-	Options are contracts that you can buy or sell that give the contract holder the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell a stock at a particular price on a particular day
-	A “put” is an option that gives the option holder the right to sell a stock at a particular price. If company $FOO is trading at $100 and you think they’re going to go down to $90, you can buy $95 PUTs and them when they do go down, you’re holding a contract that says you can sell a $90 share for $95. That’s good. If $FOO goes to 110, then your contract is useless. 
-	Margin is a loan that you get from a broker to buy more stock than you could normally afford
-	Robin Hood usually only gives you leverage up to the equity you have in your account. Put in 2k, borrow 2k from RH, buy 4k of stock. 
-	Margin is a loan. You have to pay it back with interest

Aforementioned autist found a loophole that let him basically borrow unlimited money from RH and bought 50k of PUTs on apple the day of their earnings call. Apple went up, so those options became worthless. He basically borrowed 50k and lit it on fire.",ipcoffeepot,wallstreetbets,25.0

This was (is?) a loophole.  No one should/would let anyone do this.

He bought AMD shares and sold deep in the money calls which gave him money back.  The loophole was that RH thought this was new money didn't realize it would have to be paid out to cover the calls when they became assigned. 

So RH, thinking this was new money, allowed him borrow more.  He then repeated the process until he had borrowed 100k of RH's money.  

50k was tied up in the AMD accounting fraud.  And the remaining 50k was put into AAPL options.  Had AAPL ended the day down or had he bought calls, he might have gotten away with it.  In fact he was up the day before and RH did not notice what he had done.

What makes this really dumb is that any day ending down would have resulted in a margin call.  RH collecting the debt and liquidating his position.",DaveJ00,wallstreetbets,31.0

But his luck would change one day when he found a glitch in RH risk management, the ability to sell covered calls and buy stock in a recursive loop until he leveraged himself 50X with the ability to use half with options. What a day! 

With his new found lotto ticket, CTN did about 14 seconds of DD when he heard some guy behind the 7-11 smoking a swisher sweet talking about how AAPL is overrated and totally going to go down. That was good enough for CTN! He took ALL of his margin and bought FD putss that expired the day after earnings. But not to worry, he purchased these puts well within his Personal Risk Tolerance (PRT). Even if he lost, it's no big deal. But he just *knew* he was going to win. 

Then came the fateful day of AAPL earnings release. And release they did, all over CTNs PRT portfolio of puts. They went from $14K up to 100% loss in a matter of seconds after AAPL announced they blew the crap out of earnings. And to the delight of WSB, CTN owned his loss and posted the most intimate reaction to a loss we've ever known, a *video* of his loss reaction at market open. Thus ""GUH"" was born and now rings clearly through the halls of WSB lore every time a loss is sustained. Glory be CTN and his contributions to our sub! 

Oh but this was only the beginning! CTN has discovered a well of candy that keeps on giving! RH has the most inept risk tolerance team ever devised for a real broker and has yet to close the loophole! This has allowed WSB to blossom with many more wonderful tales of $1M exploits, one of which further bet on AAPL tanking! u/woodc93 and u/moonyachts and u/tomatotowers each shared their wonderful tales of how they are going to begin their prison sentences with us! 

Let us all remember this magical time in WSB where a loophole allowed everyday yolo artists with heavy doses of the 'tism to bet insane amounts of money for the entertainment of us all. We may never experience a roller coaster of emotion to this degree ever again so quickly. I will cherish every hour and every new tale that lands upon us.

I’m in deep remission right now. On REMICADE and weed.. I get flares every so often but I’m pretty much ok. Stress is obviously the number one issue with this disease... stress even a little bit and shit starts to spiral out of control.

1) don’t FOMO

3) play either VERY strong stocks (AAPL, etc), or just the index ETFS (QQQ SPY IWM etc)

3,2019-11-07,"Dude, leave. If you spent more than 15 minutes researching and you still think this is a good place to start to make money for someone in your position, you're in for a bad time. 

This is literally gambling with extra steps. You'll have a much better time learning to play Poker. Bunch of Indian Casinos are 18+. The buy in to even have a good time playing options is at least 10x what you have saved up. You can afford at most two decent plays.

I remember being 18 and having no money. The idea of getting ""rich"" quick was very appealing but if it was so easy, everyone would be driving lambos. You are way better off going to the personalfinance sub which actually has good advice for someone in your current situation. All you have to do is start a vanguard account and just dump as much money as you can in some growth fund. Stonks literally only go up over time which you have a lot of. If you're feeling nuts just make your own memestock portfolio with TSLA MSFT DIS AMD AAPL. A few hundred bucks into those stocks a month.

So about a week ago our hapless investor finds the 'infinite money glitch' on Robin Hood, where you could exploit a stupid bug in their trading platform to start with $2,000 and build up basically an infinite amount of borrowed money to trade with. So this person did that and ended up with $50k and then made some risky YOLO bet on AAPL options or some shit.

Anyway, the bet didn't work out, so they lost a ton of money, more than they actually had in the first place since they were borrowing infinite amounts of money. The 'guh' comes from when they logged onto the trading platform at the start of the day and realized they lost a ton of money that they didn't even have. They made some weird sound like a frog saying 'guh' when they saw the loss. That's the reference, it's like a minute into the video from the linked reddit post.",rabidstoat,wallstreetbets,7.0

He now has a compounding 5% liability to pay back RH. 

RH will close these positions IF the margin call is not met within a cerain amount of time. Since he has no intention of covering hundreds of thousands in margin RH will close them after a set amount of time that he has to cover his liability.

Im sure if he put in any effort to contact RH support and tell them to close the positions they would.

By calculations of 5% margin loan on 1.4 mill compounded daily, you are on the hook for over 70K in interest within the first year.

I honestly dont foresee bankruptcy helping you out here. Your liability was clearly to defraud RH on this YOLO bet.. which is theft. That in no way can be cleared via bankruptcy as you committed a crime knowingly. IF a person maxes out credit cards with the intent to defraud the credit card companies and declare bankruptcy this cannot be cleared as its FRAUD.

You are on the hook for 1.4 mill. Unless you are planning on winning the lottery or by some random chance are really wealthy you are f'd. The fact that you took out 30K for a loan to trade the market, my guess is that you are not wealthy and able to pay back the 1.4 mill... that interest is going to destroy you for the rest of your life.

14,2019-11-10,"As a paper boy I bought a bunch of random stocks during the early dot com hype days and never sold. I found a reciept recently for a stock trade of around $2000 of AAPL at a price between $20-30. I’ve never sold. Due to various stock splits during that time my investment webpage has my purchase price at ~$2. 

At the time of course AAPL was a basket case and I have no idea why I bought it. Perhaps I read some article about Steve Jobs coming back? I have no idea. My uncles who worked in tech both figured Apple was dead and I was an idiot.

For a long while I’ve resultantly had ~$100k in AAPL, though in the last short while that spiked to $140k. At some point I moved some shares to Canada’s new tax free savings account, and while I meant to diversify, not doing that turned out to be a happy accident. That USD$33k of AAPL is now up ~100% and worth CAD$ 90k.

I basically got ultra lucky with AAPL in particular but in general I picked good ones during that time, perhaps due to being a bit conservative since as a paper boy I didn’t have that much money, I stuck with the bigger companies instead of stuff like Pets.com. MSFT was another purchase around that late ‘90s time that paid off, as was EBay and Google (Tho I sold google at $600 whoops).",mukmuk64,wallstreetbets,14.0

Meanwhile, AAPL is nearing the conclusion of its own wedge pattern, where I'm similarly hedged a few small puts.

 1. VIX was higher earlier in the year OR 2. During Earnings Season

I would check the implied weekly move of the earnings stock, the average implied move of previous earnings (to see outliers as well), and the calculate the value of the move based on that percentage (so like 4% could be 7$ depending on the stock).

Example: Disney earnings implied move: 5% or 7$, I would sell OTM Condors around a 7-8%  or $10 move with a decent width (distance between short and long leg). They would be weeklies so I could immediately profit off the high IV the next day if the trade goes my way. I have always profited (7/8 this year) off this during earnings season except one time I got greedy with CSCO and moved it a little closer, but outside, the implied move. Managed to not lose a lot on that though. Some earnings stocks to look at: FB, DIS, SNAP (go a little bit extra otm on SNAP), AAPL, AMD

A little too much day trading and a locked up account later I finally was able to trade again. This time I thought I was going to play it smarter. I bought my calls farther from the expiration date and I was making about 100 bucks a day, riding the bullish market, selling my SPY, DIS, and AAPL calls. I bought NVIDIA calls last Tuesday, and Wednesday I was $50 in the money and thought ""nah it'll go higher"". I had about $800 in one call and the next day everything dumped and I thought it bounced back, held on a little longer.  I thought they'd keep mooning but they dropped.

TWTR is flat vs one year ago while FB AAPL etc are all up 40-50%+. The recent slump was HUGE and puts it at a major discount relative to these juggernauts which IMO means it is now very undervalued. I am long on FB and I may imminently be long on TWTR. 

I like TWTR's staying power as they have become more of a NETWORK than a social network. I.E., their users are now essentially the pre-digital equivalent of television shows, having the President et al with their own followers. 

Even if they are not growing in userbase I think they will monetize more successfully as the importance of the network to its users (the shows) means it is unlikely to go anywhere anytime soon. Even if it is not growing as fast as FB, if FB and others grow 10-25% in 2020 in terms of stock price, why wouldn't TWTR revive to match their #s if the sudden drop was an event that was severely overblown?",developmentfiend,wallstreetbets,2.0

Their attempt a series was c- and I’m being generous. Amazon Prime will remain a subscription beast no doubt but definitely not because it has an arsenal of great tv, but because of e-commerce. So it comes down to DIS and NFLX. I can’t see ppl watching g - pg-13 all the time. If anything DIS will be an addition and create a healthy competition. I think it’d be interesting to see users disposable income because I believe majority will keep both services or at the very least keep one alternate the other or vice versa. With the Witcher, Stranger things, altered carbon, black mirror, ozark, narcos, whatever those game of thrones guys are making and other original content tailored to specific countries, yea DIS is hot right now and will be even more so when the mcu series start in late 2020 but I say NFLX will have a strong 2020/2021 as well.",air2throne,wallstreetbets,7.0
