It's interesting to note that lung disease isn't even the top condition at risk.

232.5c 5/22  IV ended at 45.59. The other ducked up part I just noticed is the giant spread. 4.90 vs 9.25. Another issue to consider. It has very low volume.

I guess it depends how much Wall St wants to believe in a housing/economic crisis in 2021 and that HD/LOW will be damaged by it enough to impact their current valuation.  If they do then SPY should not be as high as it is 🤷‍♂️",18845683,wallstreetbets,14.0

They are always extremely busy this time of year. Always

My brother was gonna do an entire home remodel project himself and ran into issues with it financially so put the project on hold.

On top of that, they have been open the whole time and are not going to get the same heavily adjusted eps all of these other companies are getting. I’m guessing their earnings aren’t going to be as impressive as expected and will correct due to their ath stock prices right now.

Some companies did both, like HD/LOW.  They should get rewarded most of all.

&gt;Tl;dr A lot of people have noticed the massive crowds at Home Depot and Lowe's of late.  This past weekend I did some Google Trends DD to see if that's really showing up numerically somewhere.  I found that HD and Lowe's are both at **all time highs** for search interest, with trends since February comparable to Corona plays like Netflix and Amazon, except more linear.  It's worth noting that unlike those stocks, HD and Lowe's haven't yet recovered or exceeded their pre-virus prices, although they have had a bit of a run-up today and Friday.


&gt;[Home Depot and Lowe's have seen a steady, sharp increase in search activity since March](https://i.imgur.com/1YAZ8zK.png).  In fact it appears to be an all-time high, even more than the holiday season.  And HD/Lowe's are pretty insulated from the Amazonification of shopping- a lot of their stuff is convenience based, or bulky items, or stuff you want to check out in person.

&gt;[Compare to the CV19 All-Star stocks Amazon and Netflix, along with Wal-Mart to compare to Amazon as a retailer](https://i.imgur.com/H1F4Kn7.png), there is a similar but more linear uptick for the home improvement stores.  And AMZN/NFLX/WMT stocks are at all-time highs.

&gt;[Etsy, Ebay, and Wayfair have seen upticks in search activity similar to the hardware/home improvement stores](https://i.imgur.com/lO7oop7.png).  (Side note, in contrast to these, Poshmark took a severe hit during the onset of the outbreak- used clothing not so hot during a virus outbreak I guess- although a recovery seems to be underway). However, their stocks have mostly already recovered their pre-corona prices.  Still some room to run possibly, if you think the landscape has permanently changed in their favor.  eBay especially has potential to challenge Amazon in online retail if they can get on the right track.

&gt;Just for comparison to Wayfair, HD, and Lowe's- [nobody much cares about Bed Bath and Beyond right now](https://i.imgur.com/wBXgwgt.png), which is just as well since their stores are closed. 

&gt;&gt;*4/28 addendum*: Actually as it turns out, BBBY released strong online sales increases and skyrocketed yesterday, and is now up about 30% since Friday.  On that note, there is a small uptick in the search activity for Bed Bath Beyond. That could represent growth in online sales. If so, as HD and Lowe’s have much larger upticks I wonder if that could also be pointing in part to strengthening online sales, which the markets seem to love.

&gt;Bottom line, the hardware/home improvement stores are tracking the hot internet stocks in terms of search interest and anecdotal feet through the doors, yet their valuations have lagged.  I wonder if the markets are overweighting the loss of construction business.  This could present an opportunity for HD/Lowe's to surprise at earnings, which is really what an earnings play is all about.

&gt;Positions: 

&gt;HD 6/19 220c, 245c

&gt;LOW 6/19 110c, 125c

Alright guys..this is  not a DD but extra info on HD....I went in there today...30 min wait to just get inside...they are only allowing 100 people jn the store at once. The company has weekly earning goals they have. Last fall, they fell short of them said an employee as the store who has been there for years, and they still crushed earnings q4 2019.He also stated that even though they only allow 100 people in the store at one time, they are SURPASSING their weekly goals by Tuesday, Wednesday at the latest. Their pre covid share price was around 244..this stock has gone up 8% in the past week and still has $10 to go to reach pre covid. Their earnings are expected to crush q4..idk if I will be playing earnjngs, but I will Be adding to my calls I already have on hand. Q4 they stated that they are adding stores. I do not know what the guidance will
Be, but if there is no solution to covid in sight, this could help the stock as we have seen with companies who have thrived by people staying at home (atvi, peleton etc)

So if HD sales to pro customers went way down, it is likely to at least balance out increased sales to DIYers, and worst case outweigh them.

Publix is apparently a good one as well, my friend is a manager there and she said that a store manager at her old store. Makes more off his dividends than he did from his salary at the store.

***CSCO*** still holding. Bought on Friday AM so I am still up about 30%, but at one point I was up like 60% today. Hoping for a run-up so I can dump before ER tomorrow AH

***8x8*** calls probably shit the bed, still got my fingers crossed on CYBR earnings beat for tomorrow AM (both were around $800 positions). Happy with their earnings beat tho

***CYBR*** riding through ER. Was up a little from this morning but went down hard at EOD. Holding, probably will liquidate tomorrow depending on ER (pre-market tomorrow)

***NET...*** I was able to make some fuckin money off today. Sold my NET baghold from earnings and actually made $500 toal on NET, up from -$6500 this morning. Got lucky and sold at the high.

***AAPL*** calls, I panic dumped them and saved a ton of money, only lost like $200 or so which was fucking clutch. Would have lost like $3k if I had held I think. Was up but glad I didn't lose much

***SDC***  caught the falling knife and opened calls at $.90 (EOD at $.75). Might double up tomorrow AM because they *should* run up to earnings

***TSLA***, I panic bought 20 shares at close today. Wanted options but pussied out. I think with Trumps tweet they will moon tomorrow but didn't want to gamble too much

***FB*** calls 6/19 EOD today. Hopefully not a fucking mistake. Will see in a few days.

***DDOG*** calls printed nicely!! 250% gain, sold at $69.69 for good luck

**Logi** shit the bed but I was able to recover most of my loss from the morning

***ZNGA*** calls into earnings finally went from .01 to .00 which was funny. Small position - not even worth my time to liquidate the position, just let it expire I guess

**Watchlist for tomorrow;**

TSLA, NVDA, Maybe try another AAPL/AMD scalp if it feels right

Looking for an entry to DKNG also, want to see if it drops overnight.

BTW I also did a similar analysis on SFIX and already bought puts [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/18845683/comments/gxel19/short_sfix/)

This strategy worked out for me on calls for HD, LOW, AEO, HOME, and NWL so far, although I paper-handed my HD/LOW calls and HOME/NWL have been helped by a general market uptrend.  I'm pretty happy with how AEO worked out tho ([see my comments in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/grja7m/dd_american_eagle_outfitters/))- that was on the heels of URBN and ANF stumbling on earnings and bad news for GPS, so it could be argued I successfully and rationally bet against market sentiment. AH had me pretty worried tho lol.

We'll see if I got ahead of my skis this week on Tuesday for SFIX (or actually Monday evening, but AH can be misleading).  I'm guessing SPY goes even higher Sunday night and I may have bought the SFIX puts too early, but then again it barely rallied on Friday (which to me suggests the market considers it a stay-at-home stock, and also that it may have been rallying due to short covering. No more SFIX calls showed up in unusual option activity Friday so that may be an indication the short covering has paused for now).

I'm not posting DD anymore here because I don't want the hassle from people here/don't want people mad if I'm wrong, and also don't want the possibility of this strat becoming the norm for WSB (yeah paranoid I know) and then being noticed and priced in by MM/smart money. If this is actually a good strategy for the current market it's not hard to replicate, and who knows how deep their machine learning text comprehension goes. Fuck the tutes

edit: For GES it's possible that the lackluster US results don't matter as much because they are increasingly popular outside of the US ([Q4 2020 earnings from March](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/03/18/guess-inc-ges-q4-2020-earnings-call-transcript.aspx)).

And all of them will have profit motives that would undermine the team, which gives AMZN a massive advantage.     
       
That said, the SHOP+WMT team up isn't just PR. They're essentially trying to do what everyone thought AMZN would do with Whole Foods -- turn it into a physical location for it's ""Best Selling"" items. WMT's facilities could also become warehouses for SHOP's products, and SHOP could sell that service to it's customers for extra revenue.      
     
Still, as I said, I'm with you. If AMZN wants to end the game, they could partner with TGT or COST and lease them their AMZN Go tech. WMT can't compete against that in a post COVID world.

2,2020-07-06,"##It May Be A Long Wait For The Next $1 Trillion Dollar Company

&gt;Alphabet closed the week with a market value just above $1 trillion, making it the fourth member of the trillion-dollar club, along with Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon.com.

&gt;The group is likely to remain exclusive for a while. There's no obvious fifth candidate. Among U.S. companies, Facebook (ticker: FB) is next in line, but the social giant has a long way to go to reach trillion-dollar status. Its market value is $665 billion. The social network is currently under fire for how it polices content, but it has a mammoth global user base -- 3 billion people use Facebook, Instagram, or WhatsApp on a monthly basis -- that no other company can match.

&gt;After Facebook, though, there's no other U.S. company with a market value between $500 billion and $1 trillion. (There are two foreign stocks in that range. Alibaba (BABA) and Tencent (0700.Hong Kong) are both valued around $600 billion.)

&gt;There are two companies in the $400 billion range -- Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) and Visa (V) -- and three with a 3-handle -- Mastercard (MA), Walmart (WMT), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ).

&gt;There are 13 U.S. companies with valuations between $200 billion and $300 billion -- Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), UnitedHealth (UNH), Home Depot (HD), Intel (INTC), Nvidia (NVDA), Verizon Communications (VZ), Netflix (NFLX), AT&amp;T (T), Adobe (ADBE), PayPal (PYPL), Tesla (TSLA) and Walt Disney (DIS).

&gt;So which company is most likely to reach $1 trillion next? There's no easy answer. Most of the companies above $200 billion in market value are mature slower-growing businesses. They seem unlikely to double, triple or quadruple in size.

&gt;Here's how Barron's would handicap the race for the next trillion-dollar stock:

&gt;Tesla (TSLA): Already the most valuable car maker, Elon Musk's company has fundamentally changed what had been a slow-moving industry. To get to $1 trillion, Tesla's market cap would need to quintuple. To bet on Tesla to get there, you have to believe that Musk can substantially grow volumes, and maybe move into some large adjacent businesses, perhaps autonomous car hailing or robotic package delivery.

&gt;Walt Disney (DIS): Disney currently has plenty of issues. Theme parks? Closed. Sports? Shutdown. Movie production? Suspended. Traditional TV? On the wane. And yet, this is a company that has vast intellectual property assets and a knack for juicing them for decades. People are still watching Snow White, which debuted in 1938. At some point themes parks will open, sports will resume, and we'll head back to the movies. Some day, when Covid 19 is history, Disney could move to the front of the trillion-dollar race.

&gt;Disney/Netflix: One way Disney could get bigger in a hurry would be to team up with Netflix, adding the world's largest subscription-based video service to the Disney family. Simply combining the two companies would mean a market value over $400 billion.

&gt;Amazon Web Services/YouTube/Instagram: It's not impossible that the next trillion-dollar company could be buried inside an existing trillion-dollar company. If there's a complete regime change in Washington this fall, with Democrats taking not just the White House but also both houses of Congress, pressure to break up megacap tech companies could increase and spur structural change. The most obvious candidates for spinoffs are Amazon Web Services, the largest provider of cloud computing services; Alphabet's YouTube, by far the dominant player in ad-supported online video content; and Instagram, Facebook's hipper little sibling.

&gt;JPMorgan Chase: The country's largest bank has a prominent CEO in Jamie Dimon and a history of innovation. Could a financial services company reach $1 trillion? It's possible, though it might require a little sprinkling of M&amp;A magic to make it happen. The other obvious candidates from the financial services realm are Mastercard and Visa.

&gt;Wild Card: Could a pharma company soar to trillion-dollar status with a cure for Covid-19 or cancer or aging? Maybe. Could we see a shift in energy markets that drive oil companies back into the mix? Doubtful, but not impossible. Could another social networking player get there? Potentially, but it feels like a long shot. The venture backed company with the highest current valuation is China-base ByteDance, parent of the social media phenom TikTok. But it's not clear TikTok can ever reach Facebook's scale -- others have tried. Snap is worth just $34 billion, and Twitter, $24 billion.

&gt;Long shot pick: How about SpaceX? Elon Musk's other startup is already doing things in space travel that no private company has ever done. Musk's long- established goal is to get people to Mars. Or what if Tesla, which previously bought Solar City, decides to buy SpaceX, creating a transportation giant that can take you to the grocery store -- or to the end of the universe.",BlakeRidley,wallstreetbets,2.0

4,2020-08-01,"I've been holding a lot for a long time haha. BAC is something that I always recommend and have been holding since 09, AIG is another. BAC has good financials and has remained strong. A few others, NTDOY, SNE, XOM, IBM, a share of BRK.A(parents got it for me back in 2013 for 15x or something) and a few other stocks. I literally never look at that portfolio, it's just buy, forget and reinvest divys. I add on when the opportunity arises. 

I look for things that are a staple product and integrated into society and the world to the extent that if they were to disappear, it would have a significant impact. A simpler way to look at it, ""too big to fail"". Obviously there are other plays I make into low vol illiquid stocks.  Day to day, I just play options for fun. 

ATVI and ETSY are good. AMZN is something to consider holding long-term. As for HD and LOW(good plays), also consider some home builders LEN and DHI. They have been performing well Q/Q. PINS, I don't know too much about them. PTON is good because they're one of the few publicly traded fitness stocks. Another is NLS(~60 times smaller market cap than PTON) which makes good quality workout equipment(much better than  PTON in my opinion) but most people want something simple and would probably pay someone to workout for them. I think the future is also dependent on the outcome for bat soup. If people are more inclined to work from home, then it's a buy.

18,2020-08-02,"LOW has been outpacing HD since last earnings, but there has been a fundmantal consumer shift that might help tip the scales back to HD.  In short, the people doing WFH began their projects when quarantine/WFH/unemployment began, and all the big contractor projects were shut down because of social distancing, etc.  However, 3-5 months later, there's been a shift back to more bigger contractor projects and less do-it-yourself-ers.  We're also seeing shortages in the supply chain that would hurt companies like LOW more than HD.  They have had strategies in place to plans on how to ramp up for a surge in big projects (due to events like major natural disasters), but they have never had to ramp up like this for a surge in DIY-ers.

HD might have a phenomenal Q2, but I've been a little fundamentally nervous about some of HD's policies that may balance the book in favor of Q2 earnings to the detriment of Q3+ earnings.  However, it might have such a blowout Q3 anyway that it won't matter.",iDidaThing9999,wallstreetbets,18.0
19,2020-08-02,"LOW is the way. Lost bigly on HD last earnings. That’s my DD. 

Also daily candle chart looks more bullish. HD could be forming an inverse cup n handle / double top. Q2 earnings for these guys is also not until mid August which is a long ways away. 

Roll your tendies through some weekly earnings and wait to yolo until the day before earnings for either of these on a weekly expiration. This way you can just yolo profits if you were right during the weeks prior on other companies. If you’ve been wrong up until then maybe don’t yolo or play these earnings. 

We’ve been tossing a $20 or $30 at a few companies 2-3 times a week and netting 1000% gains. Sure, I wish I would have tossed a nice rack instead of my lunch money but at the same time when I’m wrong I’m not blessed with a shitty P/L loss to share with our wsb autists.  Turning $23 into $300 overnight still gets your rocks off any day of the week (thank you PINS for that one)(CLX gave me 180% during intraday on Friday on my yolo for Monday. Sold and redid my yolo for another $30 since my first $35 turned into $100 in just a couple hours).

If they start releasing everything for streaming at the same time as in the movie theatre, some people won't bother going to the theater.  If they make it significantly cheaper to stream than go see in the movie theater, then that SOME will turn into MOST. Even for my family of three, we would be borderline on a $30 streaming cost vs probably $40 just for tickets for two adults and a kid. Add in the fact that my wife ALWAYS wants popcorn, and yeah we're watching that shit at home and saving like $20 or more.

My living room has the advantages of cheap unlimited popcorn and food, serves beer, will pause the movie while you go use the restroom, AND doesn't have random annoying people that I don't know in it.

As far as upgrading to movie theater quality goes, buy the biggest fuckhuge HD TV or projector you can find, some sweet speakers, blackout curtains if necessary, and crank the volume up to the desired level. At that point the only thing that beats your home theater by much is IMAX.

Further, based on NLS wild overperformance on earnings today, there is a solid indication that the same will apply to PTON with exercise equipment being far more popular than predicted during lockdown.

7,2020-08-13,"I got in a few weeks ago when it was 143. I bought 15 155c and 5 155c 8/21. Cashed out on those for a nice profit and rolled those into 20 152.5 calls and cashed those out for 3k profit. 

I’ve done more DD on this stock just have never made a post. I saw 185 strikes 10/16 expiration going for 0.30 a premium so I bought 20 and watched it get to over 0.5 in a couple days. I ended up buying 70 more to bring my average price to 0.49. It went all the way to 1.15 today before settling at 1.05 and I am up 112%.

I’m at a crossroads here though. I want to hold through earnings and since volatility on these is only at 30% I’m thinking I might do so. I know they will do good through earnings and iv crush on these won’t be too bad if the stock drops. I still have 2 months to get these to where I want to sell. 

I’ve looked at HD and LOW last quarter and LOW continued to rise after earning. The CEO also purchased 10,000 shares in March prior to last quarters earnings. So far I haven’t seen any insider buying nor selling. I’m gonna count that as a good thing. I’m worried about HD setting the bar too high. If HD crushes, that’s a great sign for LOW to do well also. I fully expect LOW to follow the same path as HD the day before LOW earnings since they are one day apart. If HD crushes, then LOW will go up higher the day of HD earnings leading into the next day. I’ll have to keep an eye out.

Either way, I don’t think it’s too late for anyone. Just buy ATM and don’t hold through earnings if you are looking for 8/21 expiration.",gnarledout,wallstreetbets,7.0

Ok how the fuck is HDS so cheap? Not only is it on sale today with everything else, but it really hasn’t seen the meteoric rise like other similar institutions. 

Every contractor I know uses them. They have everything, they have great prices and construction was freaking face ripping all summer long. If Home Depot and Lowe’s were on a tear, why not HDS?

Furthermore, look at their 9/18 contracts. Cheap right now. They popped a bit around 8/10 on news of selling White Cap. Proceeds will be 2.5bn. It said they’re gonna use it for business shit but also to return money to shareholders. It’s getting announced at their 9/8 earnings call. Do you like $? Me too.

Special dividend time? I don’t see any dividend history but I’m also an idiot. Read here:

&gt; HD Supply expects to use the net proceeds from this transaction to return capital to HD Supply shareholders, fund M&amp;A activity and repay debt. A more detailed discussion around the use of proceeds will take place on our second-quarter earnings call in early September.

Yes I already laid down my position and if you all pile in it would help but almost sure it will work either way.  

RH - Restoration Hardware reports tomorrow (mkt close).  Regardless of what you think of the company it’s a quarantine stock and it’s up over 100% for the year.  And even if they report fuck-you numbers the trend for all most of these stocks (home improvement) is to plummet right after they report.  Check these out, most reported solid numbers and still plummeted after earnings.... William Sonoma, At Home, FND, Pier 1, Kirk, LL, even fucking HD.  (Yes Warfare is the exception however they reported ZM type #’s).  Go check my data or check it out in the morning - Lovesac reposts in the am bet they will report solid #’s and mostly then trend downwards.

Next AMD puts out the hd 6970 and it is against the gtx 480. Amd was once again clearly ahead here and they also had the 6990 but that was a dual gpu card so not a good comparison.

Next up we have the hd 7970 on amds side and the gtx 680 on nvidias, AMD is the winner here again.

After this point AMD remained competitive and cheaper but slightly behind flagship to flagship up until the gtx 1xxx series where Nvidia really took the lead back.

I’ll wait retard. 

Like I said. More taxes means nothing if the guys in charge don’t manage it correctly. 

All of you thinking more taxes = Utopia are delusional. That not how it works at all

And we also work harder than 98% of the people. Do you not think surgeons deserve their pay?? It’s all proportional and fair. You are thinking of Hollywood movie/ Kim K shit which isn’t real life, esp not at $400k lol


Edit: To your question; Every business you buy after $400k will only make you 40% of what it actually makes. When you expand further out, you can not do everything yourself so you have to hire additional management. So now, not only does it make a ton less bc higher taxes, but it also looses money to management. Now your usual 60% take home (under current taxes) went to 40% after that tax bump and probably 20% after management. 20% of income for all the pain and headache that comes with it is not worth it. + If business slows, or there’s a big accident, or people steal and you don’t micromanage and catch it, it will be very hard to survive and keep it afloat. 

Pls, I can tell you’re just an employee and don’t own anything. When you run your own business and put yourself on the line 24/7, you will understand. It’s so stressful and annoying. You have no life. No one in their right mind would make it even harder on themselves for just 10-20% of what an additional business would make them.

Housing sales have been huge and interest rates are at unreal lows for house loans. People buying their houses are all doing home improvement in down time. 

Home renovation in the last 6 months has been cranking. Contractors have hardly had any downtime during COVID. Housing market booming has caused people to fix houses to sell as well as spend in HD to improve. 

Foreclosure takes a while. Banks that are clearing their books have nothing to do with HD. Unsold homes or a lack of work for renovation / development however does. 

Even if market takes a dip, there’s a ton of jobs under contract and paid for that won’t stop - and will go on for months. Last housing crisis took half a year to start to truly unwind. So really if there is concern it will be in Jan-Feb and stimuli will happen by then if it’s an issue

3,2020-12-08,"Hm...not professional but heres my take on your places:

HD is ok and it will have a pump sometime by January but dont hold beyond as it is trending down. Winter is a season that usually sees home project dwindle.

UPS due for a good pump both with holiday shipping and vaccine shipment. Airline and anything to do with shipping is going to see a pump one way or another in the very near future

Apple hope you didnt buy at the top, Apple near ATH, going to make it difficult to break out $120 -$130 range. However, keep an eye out for projected iPhone/IPad sales for Xmas. Could either sky rocket it or tank it depending on how well it sales

DKNG...ugh, alot of its territory is being eaten up by competitors. I'd exit now and take my losses now and look to reinvest. If it has morning pump tomorrow, sell asap (dont get greedy, get out with money still in hand).",RAGE_CAKES,wallstreetbets,3.0

3,2020-12-09,"Gamestop was the top Google search query during console release week and week after. Gamestop was the only to sell consoles in-store. Gamestop continued to drop lots of consoles while other retailers did not. 

Both manufacturers have stated their focus is selling the upper-model disk drive versions of their consoles. The diskless Xbox is of lower-grade performance which doesn't tickle the gamer's fancy. And you can only fit so many digital downloads on an HD, physical is instant gratification and more flexible.

75% of store dedicated to collectibles, toys and collectible card games is a bit of an exaggeration, and they are liquidating this inventory well with double-digit percentage reductions in inventory assets Q after Q. Inventory efficiency is improving.

Closing underperforming stores, trimming the fat as seen by reduced SG&amp;A Q after Q. Your local shop may be an underperformer waiting for lease to expire to close its doors.

Take a look at the following and buy calls 4-5 months out on whichever stock you like the best.  Make sure to look at the chart and determine your stop losses and when you will abandon the play. 

Home Depot (HD) 

Best Buy (BBY)

McDonalds (MCD)

Salesforce (CRM) Think this actually goes a little lower in the future 

BigLots (BIG)

Tandem Diabetes (TNDM) My highest conviction play 

Inovalon (INOV) 

EXELIS (EXEL)

BigCommerce (BIGC)

Simulations Plus (SLP)

NO WEEKLIES, buy calls 4-5 months out on some of these names and track them daily. You will hit on 30-40% of the names and as long as you cut the losers when the lower end of support on the chart, your $$$$$ will increase as long as the market doesnt get blasted.
