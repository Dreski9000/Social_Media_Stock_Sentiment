&gt;So either you have a flawed understanding of classical liberalism, or the founding fathers weren't classical liberals.

this goes against the definition of classical liberalism that I've been told for years, I've never heard classical liberals painted like this by right wingers or left wingers. So I reject this shit definition. This isn't how I was defining them because I don't get my political definitions from fucking Wikipedia. But regardless. I can't remember what we were arguing about-- oh yeah. You said it was leftist. At that time maybe you could maybe make that argument 

But it isn't left wing anymore. In fact, I'd argue the Nu conservatives (see Tucker Carlson) are by your definition of them the inheritors of classical liberalism, 

People back then didn't think it was wrong. Granted, there were a few prominent historical figures that opposed the institution of slavery, but many more thought it was the right and proper natural order. Although it is ironic that you say slavery persisted because of economic reasons (which definitely part of the full story), yet you also say the free market will take care of everything. Looks to me the free market, by your own reasoning, helped preserve the institution of slavery.

No. I'm saying people back then we're too stupid to realize that the economy wouldn't collapse with the loss of slavery. In no way was I saying that these people were valid in their belief and by saying that saying the market is infallible 

Because neither of those things are true 


However with that said, Henry David Thoreau said [this](https://gyazo.com/3ec92c70a12037f78ac65d1900a67bb2) in his book civil disobedience. This I think proves my point. It's documentation of the time that people WERE opposed to it they were just complacent in doing something about ( although! He was located in Massachusetts so his area was already sort of bias, I think that it still loosely transfers to a lot of the states when you take into consideration the fact that slaves weren't allowed to be sold in DC because the government was embarrassed to have other countries see it when they came on diplomatic meetings) 


&gt;Sensible regulation is a good thing. Again, the most intelligent and hard working person on the planet does not have the time or expertise to look after their best interests in every aspect of life on their own. Having safety standards for food and buildings is a good thing. Having so regulatory body ensuring corporations aren't sending you fraudulent charges is a good thing.

People do not have the time to do everything you are correct this is why intelligent people use the free market.

If a corporation were sending you fraudulent charges they would be sued and they would go out of business and if they weren't then people would be made aware and they would go out of business- see how this works?

&gt;Lol, are you really one of these idiots? Your dumb example aside, I understand that there is such a thing as bad regulation, and we should try to avoid that. But cherry picking examples of bad regulation does not address the utility of good regulation.

Two things: 1. no I am not one of those people, but, it is a fact that the FDA allows for certain amounts of fluoride. Which is lunacy. 2.  Your correct it's hard to articulate exactly why all regulation is bad, let's look at it this way, no matter how small,  each regulation chops away at one of your rights- or at least somebody's rights. How long until you don't have those rights? Eventually you'll slowly looked all your rights with the justification of other regulation to make it right. 'Well if this regulation is cool why isn't this?' Until you really are fucked


&gt;You are aware that you can consume alcohol and marijuana in a moderate responsible way right? 

I am

&gt;Many incredibly successful people have enjoyed on or the other or both. 

Two correct in a row! You are on fire today!

&gt;These things can be abused, but so can basically everything else. 

Three in a row; can you keep it going?

&gt;Meanwhile, while you are passing moral judgment of on other people's lifestyle, you are probably some uneducated slob who is overweight or out of shape eating figurative garbage every day and slowly developing chronic diseases. Not trying to be too personal, but statistically speaking I am probably correct, and I guarantee you have a lifestyle that isn't optimal. Like most people who passionately advocate personal responsibility, you are likely shitting on people who are doing just fine while overlooking your own vices.

No. you lost your streak im afraid to say. I work on not being a degenerate every day of my life, I was born into a culture of degeneracy and I have to do what I can to get rid of those behaviors. I go to the gym ever day except Wednesday and Sunday, and I cook my own meals most of the time. I used to smoke cigarettes as my vice and I quit Easter Day this year. Haven't smoked since 

As for the uneducated thing? Sure? I attended public school but got decent grades when I could be fucked to try. I sometimes freelance programming, which most people hold as a smart thing (even though it sorta isn't it's actually more just testing how long you can sit at a computer looking at the same font before you kill yourself) and I'm obviously a semi successful day trader. (Only been doing this for three months or so) I wouldn't say I'm particularly intelligent and I wish I knew more, but that's why I had the Thoreau ready to use; at least I try.",9-8K-C,wallstreetbets,0.0
