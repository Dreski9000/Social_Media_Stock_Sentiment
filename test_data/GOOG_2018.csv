For Second Time, Mgmt Refocuses On Social vs. Media Content; Pricing Still Has Upside

Last night in a Facebook post, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company would

change the newsfeed algorithm to prioritize Social content (posted by Friends) above

Publisher content. Recall, this is the second time that mgmt raised concerns that

Social content was being overwhelmed by Media content—during the first episode,

mgmt was worried that engagement would fall as users were posting less Social

content—when in fact, the opposite happened. As such, mgmt is now saying that

engagement would likely fall as a result of these changes. The obvious take-away is

that ad volume is likely to come under pressure, as mgmt has talked about holding

ad yield constant. Meanwhile, revenue has been disproportionately driven by pricing

(+15%, +24% and +35% in 1Q, 2Q and 3Q y/y, respectively). Our calculation of

FB's US revenue/hour is still trailing GOOG and TWTR's, suggesting potential further

pricing gains are possible, in part, driven by Instagram, which trails FB in ad load, and

by the maturation of the video ad product (perhaps similar to GOOG’s Trueview ads,

where users are forced to watch 5 seconds before they can skip the ad). This also

gives FB a way to remove some of the “fake news” content that has become a risk

for the company long-term. While investors will likely have to wait until earnings on

Jan. 31 for a formal update, we would use weakness as a buying opportunity as this

“event” shows us how powerful and important a platform FB has become for users.

We are still willing the play the long-term monetization upside.",jvphish,wallstreetbets,2.0

Yes- I know this is an extreme example, but it can and has happened before. This is why most brokerages don’t let just anyone sell option.

&gt; Liu Qiangdong, 45, is known as the winner of life. In addition to being the CEO of Jingdong Mall, he remarried and married the ""Cold Tea Sister"" Zhang Zetian in 2015, becoming a good story. The mainland's ""New Fortune"" magazine announced the ""2018 New Fortune 500 Rich List"" earlier. The two men's net worth jumped to more than 65 billion yuan. The wife's milk tea sister Zhang Zetian also pressed 30-year-old Wang Sicong to become the youngest richest man on the list. 

&gt; Liu Qiangdong’s ex-wife is Gong Xiaojing. However, in 2013, Liu Qiangdong met with the tea sister Zhang Zetian during his studies at Columbia University in the United States, and later fell in love. This pair of father-daughter love is not only a sensation, but also envied the outside world. The two married in Beijing in 2015 and the next daughter in Hong Kong. In 2009, Zhang Zetian was known as a tea sister because of a photo of holding a milk tea and being praised by netizens for being fresh and refined. She is also a graduate of Tsinghua University. She joined the Microsoft Bing Search Technology Center marketing team during her school days and went to the United States as an exchange student. She therefore knew Liu Qiangdong, who was studying at Columbia University.

&gt; Liu Qiangdong first went to CCTV Finance's program ""Meeting Big Coffee"" and talked about his wife Zhang Zetian. He said such a ""golden sentence"": ""I am blind, that is, I don't know who is beautiful and who is not beautiful. To be honest, I was with her not because she was beautiful..."" and caused a hot discussion. There is a jingle on the Internet, and the five kings of the world are bounded: ""Ordinary family Ma Huateng, I don't know the wife and beauty Liu Qiangdong, repent of Ali Jackma, no Wang Jianlin, Peking University is still Sabinin""

The dip was too coordinated to be result of many money managers, only possibility is Papa Bezos withdrawing some Blue Origin monies which he does every year, that is the only whale large enough to cause the sell off and that is unlikely. If you watched the Senate committee meeting you saw that **it went terribly**, however regulation would never occur because the technological challenges are far too complex to propose any regulation, **AND** this *should* only affect social media sites and the like, where their platform is free because **YOU are the product**, this is absolutely not the case with AMZN. Trade war won’t affect AMZN, it is China-proof. AMZN will never face regulation because the US antitrust laws are put into place to prevent monopolies from being able to unfairly hurt customers, AMZN is most customer focused retailer **ever**, absurd to realistically postulate AMZN tried in antitrust.

TLDR; 
Widespread coordinated tech selloff? Unlikely. 
Overreaction to fear of gov regulation? Very likely, yet very unwarranted.

As someone who works in this industry, I can tell you that almost alway the reason for shitty security is a PO telling the dev team “lets use this shit perl script with unencrypted connection to an unprotected data store for now, and we can fix this in next sprint” and informing the leadership “everything is on track as I promised. I will deliver this.” 

Product is pushed to production, PO takes his bonus and moves to a new project and the dev team is buried in operational nightmare of running the mess, the smart ones get frustrated and quit, the incompetent ones get fired and the dumb or desperate ones keep the status quo and keep the shit show running in the hope that it will get better. 

Security is something of an afterthought as it is not considered as core expectation from any product. Only when consumers demand this, it will change.

They doubled down on the luxury part and forgot they still needed mass appeal with (at least somewhat) competitive prices, else they can't sell enough to the masses in order to bank on their services.
