Realistically?  Covered calls with an amount of shares you're okay losing.  Lowers cost basis, and gives you some sick money depending on the calls you sell.

Even if you only did half of your shares on 20-25%% out of the money calls, you'd be able to sell 15 covered calls at 540 apiece (1-21 1050C)  8100 bucks.

Do that twice a month and you're set my dude.

So yeah, in the long run if someone keeps yoloing new IPOs, then they will fail eventually. But getting lucky a few times can accelerate compound interest greatly with larger starting capital. Dropping $5k in VTI is kinda worthless. But if you manage to yolo that into $10k, then you've just saved yourself many years of compounding gains.

0,2021-04-02,"It seems like there isn't a lot of risk, because there isn't. Especially when investing in a fund with a large net like VTI (it has 3,500+ stocks in it). Side note: you do not receive dividends from the companies in the fund's holdings, you just receive the dividend from the index fund itself (in VTI's case, 1.38% yield which comes out to about ~$0.70 per quarter, per share). VTI, like most dividend yielding stocks, distribute dividends four times per year at the end of each fiscal quarter, rather than monthly. Beware of stocks with high monthly dividend distributions, because that means they are prioritizing shareholder payments rather than reinvesting shareholder money into the company/fund to improve it. In the market, if it's too good to be true, it usually is. That said, even if you're holding an index fund, a market crash a la 2008, 2018, or 2020 will still affect you, there is no running from the market crashing. That is the inherent risk with putting money into ANYTHING in the stock market.

The reason to invest in a single company is if you have high conviction in the company. For example, a popular growth stock to put clients into is Apple, since they are a pure cash play and have an incredibly strong innovation track record. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google account for a full third of the stocks tracked in the entire NASDAQ, so Wall Street in general has a high conviction on these particular companies. Warren Buffett's largest holding in his Berkshire Hathaway portfolio is Apple. 

Many people find themselves in a position where they are largely invested in a single company when they work for said company and have company stock that is granted to employees (many companies will offer clients stock in the company as part of or instead of a pay raise). For example, one of the clients I've seen has $1.2 million dollars in AT&amp;T stock since he worked as an engineer for them since the 80s. AT&amp;T pays a great dividend, and his retirement is fully funded by AT&amp;T dividends that he reinvested into fixed-income bonds. He never has to work again a day in his life.",DoctorWalnut,wallstreetbets,0.0
1,2021-04-02,"Not financial advice, I literally poopoo and peepee onto my crayon drawings for the thrill of the sport. 

I will explain to you what I wish someone explained to me when I first started trading stocks. Don't throw your money into the market without going to a brokerage like TD Ameritrade or Fidelity, and download their trading software (Thinkorswim for TD, or Active Trader for Fidelity) and look up tutorials. These softwares usually have ""paper trading"", or the ability to make trades without real money for the sake of practice. The bottom line, is to learn your respective software (which one really doesn't matter), and read as much as you can about the different styles people have for interacting with the market. Using paper money for a few years is the best bet, as you'll get to know your own trading strategy and observe the market's behavior over a long period of time. You'll quickly find that a trading strategy might work in a certain market condition, but will completely fall flat in another condition. This is because no matter what you read on Reddit, or Motley Fool, or Seeking Alpha, or even Finviz, ZERO PEOPLE other than the market makers on Wall Street that have access to the real-time order flows have any idea whether or not a stock will go up or down. This is why it's so important to do what another user said and download a balance sheet for a random company, since these numbers are part of the ""fundamentals"" of a company and are pretty much all you're going to get in determining how well their stock price will do. Even then, it's flirting with divination. 

If you really want to help your family, consider investing in an index fund (look up tickers $VTI, $VOO, $QQQ). Index funds (and ETFs) are baskets of stocks that are bought by an investment bank that track a certain index. They allow you to invest in a highly diversified collection of stocks that track a certain part of the market or even a particular industry. $VTI, for example, is an index fund that tracks the total stock market, and moves up or down with the general trends of the market (the general trend historically, of which, is up). It even pays a dividend, which is basically a quarterly/monthly payment YOU receive for holding a stock. Index funds, since they are tracking a large, diversified basket of stocks, allow you to reap the benefits of diversification, without the need to learn how to be a star stock-picker or applied portfolio management. In fact, the returns you will get from investing in an index fund, over long periods of time, will almost always (by a large margin) beat stock-picking. Active managers simply do not make better returns over long periods of time than the overall index. That said, a few grand tossed into just $TSLA a few years ago would've made you a millionaire. It's a crap shoot, so if you don't have the money to lose, focus on saving and investing in safe bets as you build up your war chest. Being fiscally responsible and productive will help those around you more than picking the next $GME.",DoctorWalnut,wallstreetbets,1.0

My brother doesn’t have a degree and makes $200k per year (and we grew up poor as shit, no connections or anything). You sound like a really good and kind hearted person and you should have a place to live and some savings! A new job would definitely help make that happen.  I’ll add two pieces of advice: one, read some basic investing books, bogleheads (Google it) and shit like that. Go to the library and get the actual books! Two, don’t let this experience put you off of investing in the stock market. Figure out what an IRA is and open an account at fidelity or vanguard or something like that and put $100 or whatever you can into an index fund every month.  VTI or VOO or something like that (Google it). If you do that for the next ten to forty years, you will have a fucking life changing amount of money at the end. Losing all your money on a terminal option play fucking sux, but i legit believe that real long term investing is pretty much the only way out of wage slavery in this country, for the average person.

Don’t just buy things because you see people post about them on Reddit, if you don’t personally believe in and understand what drives a stock, you’ll buy the top and sell the bottom. Especially since you don’t like risk and probably won’t feel great seeing volatility. 

If you don’t think you have an emotional and/or informational advantage over others, just buy VTI and chill. Put money in consistently and put MORE money in when the market freaks out.

60% VTI

20% SCHD (or other dividend growth focused ETFs, but SCHD is a good one) 

10% strong individual companies (Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Netflix, LMT, PEP, KO, etc) 

5% riskier holdings that you see a future potential for 

5% WSB stupid shit, meme stocks, gambling etc",OG-Pine,wallstreetbets,2.0

4,2021-10-04,"Well you normally want to open up an account. I recommend Fidelity it's what I use and would not recommend robinhood. There's three type of accounts 401k, roth, and brokerage. 401k you get from employer and is normally what you want to max out first because often employers will match up to a percentage of what you put in. It maxes out at \~19.5k. Can't withdraw until retirement but there are some ways around this.  


Roth is a retirement account it has a limit of \~$6,000/yr. It is taxed advantaged, in short it essentially acts like your total income is minus whatever you put into it, dividends are also not taxed in these. There are penalties if you withdraw early before like 59.5 years old (up to 10%).  


Brokerage account is basically an account to buy and trade stocks. No tax advantages. Index funds are just a basket of securities (stonks) that match a market. Popular ones are VOO, VTI. I personally use FNILX. Currently the market is in a dip so it's the best time to buy is now. However no one knows how far down the market will dip or if it will even crash. So don't throw all your money in at once, average the amount you want in over a few weeks and when the market returns as it always does you'll get like +5%.   


The people here do stock options like calls or puts which are gambling that a stock will go up or down. They can x100 their money in a day, or literally lose everything. Also it's not a 1:1 if you win or lose with options, you are more likely to lose.  


Honestly if you live with your parents for like a few years with a real career job you can just throw money into the market and pay off debts. I plan on working for about 15 years with a career job and i'll have enough to retire. If you are interested in retiring early I recommend looking into a community called FIRE (financial independence retire early). And that's pretty much the full 101. Also don't panic sell.",UwUrthium,wallstreetbets,4.0

3,2021-11-03,"Options like this look so good but I will warn you that for every person who wins this big there’s 100s who lost, just scroll down you’ll see people who lost on a similar bet. This is due to the nature of options 
1) You need to pick the right strike price to bet on which is where you think the stock will be at or above/below depending on ur position
2) You need to pick the right direction 
3) You need to pick the right amount of movement in that direction 
4) You need to pick the right date. I’ve seen people buy options that expired one day and then the stock goes up next day and they woulda made 100k if they had bought 1 further day out.
5) EVEN IF you get all the 4 above right, you’ll learn about IV crush which is where the volatility crashes and everyone basically loses money except theta gang(don’t worry about them for now but they sell the options and it’s a safer play usually)

I also got into investing and burned through couple tens of thousands trying to make it big especially because options lead to greed. It’s not like stocks where u can hold forever, once it’s 4:00pm and market closes ur money is gone whether it be $10 or $100,000,000 it doesn’t matter if you miss your target.

All that being said, there are lots of videos on YouTube about options, i believe most people recommend tastytrade tutorials. I’ll drop the links below:

https://youtu.be/HCcF7XbXEWo

https://youtu.be/SJWscCeLJrY

I wish you all the best, if I can offer you some parting words to take heed of that I’ve had to learn the hard way so you don’t have to HOPEFULLY lose your money as well.

1) Go into your trades with a plan. If you are looking to make 50% profit sell at 50 and don’t look back because that’s how you get burned.
2) NEVER EVER EVER REVENGE TRADE. If you made a bad trade, close your app and call it a day and take some days off or weeks depending on your knowledge of yourself, if you keep trading you’ll dig a deeper hole 
3) If anyone mentions a stock here that’s already ran up, it’s best you avoid it or if at all go back to advice 1 and get in and out quickly. Don’t be a bag holder you’ll kick urself.
4) NO ONE HAS EVER DIED TAKING PROFITS. Sometimes you’ll cut out for $300 profit and the potential profit goes to $3000, you might kick yourself as we all do but just remember, that’s $300 you didn’t have the day before and you made clicking several buttons on your phone. That’s $300 closer to retirement and $300 less physical work or hours you have to clock. Learn to use consistent small gains rather than seeking one time big hits. 
5) FINALLY if you ever make it big enough and hit jackpot, TAKE SOME DAMN MONEY OUT and get into safer stocks like SPY or VTI some proper ETFs and stop risking your entire equity.

Best of luck in you trading career, hope this helps :)",ChampionM1,wallstreetbets,3.0

Do you think it will still be innovating and making lots of money? I do. How about HD? KO? I would look into some energy stocks too. Collect 8% with EPD and MMP. Look at SU. How about some real estate too? VICI and NRZ pay you fat dividends. Maybe a bit of sin? MO pays 8%. If your horizon is longer, buy VTI, IMW and SCHD. Hold for decades. Retire rich.

Apple and China are too tight and China is a problem. Goog of MSFT and VOO and VTI or boring stocks that are steady earners are buying possibilities if they are cheap enough or why not sell and pay off your mtg. I couldn’t sleep at night with everything on 1 stock the stock world  and life in general is just too unpredictable. You have a lucky streak. Hope it lasts if you hold,sjssjs1,wallstreetbets,1.0

3,2021-12-11,"Thanks for the informative posts! But haven't the low-cost market cap ""boomer ETFs"" been basically outperforming any of the fancy ""smart beta"" funds?

I remember reading about RAFI's fundamental indexing and being impressed, but it appears that as the famous Yogi Berra quote goes ""In theory there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice there is"". I remember looking at the past performance, and it appears that due to the inherent value tilt, it got a larger drawdown when the market crash, and even though it *did* outperform the market in the recovery, it couldn't overcome the magnitude of the draw down. That's where I gave up on all of these fancy indexes.

I tried to see what I could with PV using VTI/VEA/VWO but I only managed to get to 85.15% CAGR in your period (using 1.58% margin rate). I wonder if this can be achieved using a much smaller amount of ETFs because 11 seems way too much to manage. Plus, how do you even decide on the % allocations between them?",Caleb666,wallstreetbets,3.0

2,2021-12-12,You are completely wrong as others have said.  The rule of thumb internal IRS people have hinted at is that 80% similar by weight or above is considered fair game for wash.  There are websites where you can compare etfs by weight.  The most common pairing is VOO/VTI which is about 84% similar by weight so that’s already in a grey area.,YSoB_ImIn,wallstreetbets,2.0
