Its not hard to tell. The deal calls for TMUS to basically buy out S at a price that as you said is well above market price. While hopes of the deal have faded, S has tanked while TMUS has trended up.

What you almost always see here is the company being bought jumps to at or near the announced price while the acquiring company takes a hit, since they are seen as having overpaid for the acquisition (cuz duh - they usually have to shell out a premium to acquire). This is unless the acquisition is seen as a total game changer like GOOG buying AMD or some shit

I’m thinking both QQQ and MSFT could take a few days to consolidate before climbing again. Also thinking the overall climate is bullish but we have a few risk factors for short term setbacks in play so I don’t want to run weeklies right now.

I bought $4.7k of AAPL calls today (4x 3/20 $320c) at an average of $11.89 when they were slightly ITM. I feel AAPL has some catching up to do vs. MSFT or QQQ and it tends to grow more consistently than GOOG/FB/AMZN/NFLX. Thought about TSM and tech ETFs but chose to just get more AAPL. It then went on sale after the news on regulatory scrutiny (reviewing all big tech mergers?) and the galaxy $1000 pricing announcement so I’m down ~$600. Anyone who wants to join in, this looks like an easy long play became even easier with the discount. I plan to carry this call until it’s about a week from expiry and see what Tim brings me.

I also took ~$1k of positions each in SPCE and PCG. 3x 3/20 SPCE 20c @$3.60 and 10x 3/20 PCG 20c @$1.03. I’m currently flat on those taken together, up a bit on SPCE and down a bit on PCG. 

SPCE is an interesting meme stock with a lot of chatter on here. Because the space tourism business is one of a kind on public markets and Sir Branson is going to not only be the president but also a client, a lot of long term and LEAPS buyers are getting in so it’s not as pump-and-dump as for instance DEAC. To the moon!

PCG is a California utility company that is on track to escape bankruptcy so share prices have been increasing steadily. Their ATH was $71.57 in 2017, and they dropped to ~$45 through October 2018 when they were engrossed in a huge wildfire settlement that ultimately looked likely to drive them to bankruptcy. The all time low was $3.55 just back in October 2019 when bankruptcy looked imminent. There were a lot of swings as the government decided whether to burn them to the ground or not. They now have reached a final settlement on the wildfires that leaves them solvent, and the stock has been strongly appreciating since then. There have been quite a few quality DD posts on PCG here over the last few months and the general sentiment is bullish.",johntaylor37,wallstreetbets,2.0

1) You are not factoring in that if the mega techs drop as much as you predict, the whole market would be way below 1800 S&amp;P. Everyone would be scrambling into mega tech and out of everything else. Mega tech is defensive stocks and will drop less than then market. 

2) 5G rollout has been delayed but not canceled. Aapl and all cloud plays will get a supercycle. Slower to rollout cuz of 🍺 🦠 but consumers and enterprises will still upgrade in 2021-2025

3) Aapl could buy DIS if it continues to drop. MSFT could buy Zoom. The point is, the titans will always have the better hand in a downturn. And will come out stronger in the other side. 

4) Don’t underestimate the bounce from the Announcement of a discover of a real vaccine. It will be late 2021 or 2022 But it will happen. And when it does, the recovery will be historic

GOOG says it could lose over $40B in ad revenue... good news there.

5,2020-05-03,"I used one metric as this is WSB and I don't want to cause any aneurysms. But please, show me what metric could possible justify the share price?

The P/E is currently around 1800! I can't believe I'm bothering to answer this, I'm partially assuming your trolling.

Lets be extremely optimistic and assume that ALL of zooms sales (revenue) gets converted entirely into profit - ie giving them a ridiculously high and unwarranted profit margin. It still gives a P/E of 40! + This is still much higher than FB,GOOG and MSFT?

Are you seriously suggesting that ZM is a company that justifies a earning multiple higher than these juggernauts? 

Back to the real world, the latest march 10K gives a net profit margin of 4% (net income/revenue as a pecentage). That is NOWHERE near what it needs to be.

The companies that maybe investment worthy at a P/S ratio of 40 are only so because, at some stage in the future, (see your MSFT's or FB's in the very early days) they are fully expected to be able to produce significant profits on their revenue. ZM has near zero chance of doing this well. It's priced as if its the next FB, or Google and clearly its not.

You say that this company has a moat and speak of the network effect, word of mouth and so on that will be positive for zoom. Do you not realize that bigger players have entire business platform solutions that are already well established subscription models? MSFT has Teams, Office 365 and OneNote for schoools ( not that zm will make any real money out of schools anyway - even though it's likely near 100m of their daily free student users will be using their infrastructure at a cost) . Google has Gsuite and so many others. Not only that, several competitors to zoom own the cloud infrastructure that ZM relies on, and use their own cloud systems to host the videoconferencing software on the cheap! How do those margins look now?

How about the network effect of businesses already using MSFT platforms or google solutions that are free? What about Adobe promoting gotomeetings through it's well known brand? Sure, in the very short term and especially when the user isn't paying anything yet Zoom will get it's name out there but as soon as they try to ask users to pay for something which is basically a commodity ( videoconferencing service/platform) they will see massive churn to the other players. This is why these other services are being offered for free by google/msft and so on; they are of no real value except as add-on to their existing business platforms/subscription models. Many-participant videoconferencing  has been around for at least 15 years, at minimum. 

Do yourself a favor and add up the entire profit all of those companies no one except you has ever heard of before, 8x8, Vonage, RingCentral . By my quick estimate you get less than $300m (some are losing money), as a comparison ZM made 22m last year. Now imagine a world where coronavirus is treatable and a vaccine is developed and there is no more hype around the virus and zoom. Now go back and take a look at the market cap of these companies that no one will ever hear of and compare it to ZM's market cap, (after!) the recent fall, of say $39 billion. Can you still tell me with a straight face that zm is worth anywhere near $135 a share?

&amp;#x200B;

If you can find a more obvious short ( in the med-long term, I'm not talking meme rallies, normies averaging down or dead cat bounces) than  Zoom please let everyone know!

3,2020-05-09,"Oddly enough, I'm now wondering if the Rona will lead to the final boom and bust of the tech stocks as we head towards re-opening the economy.  Here's my retarded thesis that is probably very flawed somehow:

Boom - Some tech companies have acquired new costumers due to the Rona.  Think forced hyper-migration into using them out of necessity.  E-commerce sites like Amazon and Etsy are getting black-friday levels of shopping traffic (or something like that) because retail stores are closed or scary to go to.  Traditional brick &amp; mortar small businesses are attempting to go e-commerce with Shopify.  Paypal reported record transactions on May 1.  All that chatty stuff is being used (Zoom, Snapchat, Facebook) because in-person contact is riskier.  Netflix and Activision Blizzard are there for home entertainment.  And I'm too retarded to understand how cloud businesses like Microsoft, Twilio, Okta, and ServiceNow are benefiting from it, but I guess that's a thing too.

Bust - Here I think is the other side of the coin with all those companies I mentioned above.  Their entire bull run is predicated on growth growth growth (especially the ones that aren't profitable right now).  You see, the stay-at-homey economy has forced a handful of tech-averse holdouts to sign up for and use their services, essentially fast-forwarding their growth (the big boom).  Now with their growth fast-forwarded, they'll hit their total addressable market quicker, and there will be a flattening of their growth curve sooner as they have no new customers left to acquire.  See, COVID-19 forced the most old-fashioned get-off-my-lawn type of people to finally succumb to using their tech products and solutions - and those customers are the end of the line... the final hold-outs... the last remaining untapped market... there are no new customers left to acquire after them and nowhere left to grow bigly.  Added to that, when the economy re-opens, some of those old-fashioned customers may ditch the tech companies' services after essentially being ""forced"" to try them out and failing miserably with them (whether for business or personal use).

And with ""peak growth"" now hit (pussy-ass tiny growth doesn't count), Wall Street will realize that with not much growth left, they will actually have to value tech companies based on (GASP!) PROFITS now, and judge them as very over-valued on that basis.  And so they will turn on the tech stonks, the cloud stonks, and FAGMAN (FB, AMZN, GOOG, MSFT, AAPL, NFLX) since for them it's ""show good growth or GTFO"".  And since FAGMAN is a major market driver, it'll drag the market down with it.

TL;DR - Stonks only go up until FAGMAN and other cloud and tech hit a growth wall (which happens sooner rather than later due to Rona).  Then the music stops.  Also, I'm really fucking stupid, so don't listen to me.",VotedOut,wallstreetbets,3.0

We've collectively deluded ourselves into believing things are going for a V or swoosh recovery because prices were effectively forced upward. I mean christ futures ended green 10 sessions in a row. Bankrupt companies are doubling daily, Pennystocks are going up 100% in a day, bad earnings are bought to the moon, unemployment is bullish, riots are bullish, nothing can stop ""Stocks Only Go Up"".

It's like putting your best hoe out there every day and shootin her full of coke so she can keep going. But after 2 weeks without eating or sleeping, her fuckin' teeth are falling out and skin is sagging. Gotta let her fuckin' rest. Markets don't go straight up, this shit is full of baloney and has been for at least a month, IMO longer. There is no logical reason companies should be trading at 6000 to 10000 P/E, or really for any of this shit. Red markets right now are a shot of reality before stimulus, FOMO, and market manipulation can come in and prop that shit up.

COVID is just the straw that broke the bitch's back, we were waaaay overbought and overpriced before any of this shit happened. Yield curve inverted months before COVID was even a thing. All bull runs come to an end eventually, and putting strings on this shit like its Weekend at Bernie's does nothing but shield our eyes from the fact that these are zombie companies that have no business being as valuable as they are. Tech is also part of the problem, but at least there is some logical reason if you're looking 30 years in the future for why AMZN, AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, FB, etc. are trading where they are.

0,2020-07-06,"Fair enough. I think you underestimate WMT's logistics a bit, but even if I'm right, you're still not wrong. To properly take on AMZN, WMT+SHOP still needs a tech partner like GOOG or MSFT, and probably FDX or UPS as well. And all of them will have profit motives that would undermine the team, which gives AMZN a massive advantage.     
       
That said, the SHOP+WMT team up isn't just PR. They're essentially trying to do what everyone thought AMZN would do with Whole Foods -- turn it into a physical location for it's ""Best Selling"" items. WMT's facilities could also become warehouses for SHOP's products, and SHOP could sell that service to it's customers for extra revenue.      
     
Still, as I said, I'm with you. If AMZN wants to end the game, they could partner with TGT or COST and lease them their AMZN Go tech. WMT can't compete against that in a post COVID world. Also, once TGT, COST, or even HD, LOW, etc. agreed to license that tech, AMZN would have them by the short curlies.

FB is a tough one as well.  I don't think that the boycott represents conviction from these companies.  All those companies were already reducing AD spend but now they can claim social credit for it.  In a melt up market, FB does OK but I do not see it outperforming as companies reduce AD spend. Same applies for GOOG but GOOG is selling tons of cloud deals.

I don't have a view on any airlines.  LUV is the best from all the others but the environment looks to be tough for a couple years.

## Events Tomorrow

* MBA Mortgage Application Index (7am)
* EOA Crude Oil Inventories (10:30am)
* Consumer Credit (3pm)

## Notable Earnings Tomorrow

* Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY, after hours). A large retailer with a struggling presence even before covid. Look for the market to extrapolate the earnings to other retailers in similar positions. Any loss here will be shifted towards online giants (Amazon, Wayfair, Walmart, etc.).

## News Today (July 7th)

* Rumors of Walmart launching a service to compete with Amazon. $95 a year, free delivery, etc.
* U.S. begins formal withdrawal out of World Health Organization (WHO)
* Gold above $1,800, highest since 2011

# Bear Day Prediction

* Spy tilts towards 305. If deaths spike, and TX, FL, AZ, Las Vegas, or CA consider shutting down (to some extent), I believe we will see a similar sell off as today in travel sectors. I believe the inevitable realization that you have to slow down coronavirus is settling in. Coronavirus will not slow down on its own.
* I believe a reality and market check will happen by the end of the week. This means a bloody day (6/4, 6% drop).

Earnings will be a pivotal stretch for the market. Considering April and May were some of the highest saving months on record, money was not moving and when money isn't moving revenue is dropping across the economy. The aftermath could be a steady -3 to -5% per week as earnings continue. Final support is 250 (+/-25), no way we dip below March.

# Bull Day Prediction

* Spy pushes towards 318 behind tech and cloud firms (F, AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, AMZN, etc.). There may be a flight to quality heading to earnings season, which will bolster SPY, DAQ, etc. R2000 and others may suffer. I believe the global response to Covid will ensure a stronger rebound in the supply chain, which we so often hear about. I believe part of the bounce early this week was in part to supply chain (China rockets up 5%, we follow suit).
* I don't see spy escaping 320 this week. No one will be going out of their way to buy heavy before earnings. As mentioned above, earnings will be important. The market could realistically carry to 350 if earnings are not ""that bad."" If consumers shifted their demand to tech and away from entertainment, I believe we will just see a shift similar in the market (I believe we're already seeing it now. Fuck TSLA tho.)

4,2020-07-10,"In my experience, I.V. spike always offsets losses from theta. Plus, many stocks tend to run up in price before earnings as well which helps off set it.

I am up between 55-130% on OTM calls I bought 2 days ago on the tech companies reporting in 2-3 weeks (AAPL, AMD, AMZN, GOOG, PYPL) I always buy minimum two contracts, once I hit 100% I sell half my contracts so the rest is all house money. Usually I sell the day earnings earnings are going to be announced/day before if they are being announced premarket the next morning sometimes keeping one contract to ride through

And, I am not sure you understand what selling options is if you think a rise in I.V. is a good thing? When you sell options, you want to sell when I.V. is high, then, I.V. drops, and the puts/calls you sold can be closed out for a profit.

When I sell an option, I want the price of the contract to go DOWN. If I sell a put and collect $1.00 in premium ($100) I want that contract to go down in value at least 50%. Then, I buy it back, locking in my 50% profit.

This is why you sell options the day of earnings/day before if announced premarket. I sold NKE puts the day before earnings, NKE dropped over 4% because their earnings report was awful. I was still able to buy those puts back 65% cheaper due to I.V. crush

Yes. NVDA today is valued as it will make 50-70bn revenue annually, in the future. With 20% earnings growth, that's 10 years away without an increase in market cap.

- For RGR, the opposite. Let it keep running up to the $5 div (need to look up date). Buy puts on that day, expecting a big drop after. Gun stocks are not good long term investments historically, so it should dip pretty heavily.

2,2020-08-05,"You have got some great points. And I have also considered these points.

But, don't underestimate the capability of Tim Apple to make us buy a new iPhone.

Margin improvements would certainly help stonk. Plus, it may eat market share of Wintel.

Now, autonomous vehicle could also be considered a big factor to help them reach 5 trillion market cap.

Sure, it would greatly help MSFT, GOOG, AMZN or others to reach higher market cap, but then there’s Apple sheeps, who would gladly buy anything from the fruit company. And other companies may also get their fair share of growth due to this bonanza of autonomous cars, but this doesn’t stop from AAPL being valued higher.

TSLA is in a whole different league and is irrelevant regarding 5 trillion market cap discussion(for now).😅

About the Huawei issue, it would and it already have had negative effect on their sales. But that didn’t really stop them from growing there.
Though, more could come to pass.

see i thought about that, how can such a loss happen,. everyone keeps saying it, and a dude told me he thinks stock market will lose 80%..and he trades. 80% bro?

I dont think it can happen unless real estate shits like 2008. but it wont, much better safeguards and timeline on that is like a year ahead for it to happen.

all the businesses that are still working all around the world - ok so they lose sales. are they gonna close when they have billions in cash and property? no.

i mean the market can go down, but it wont go down 20% - the world is as it is, the stock market is a GLOBAL thing - and worldwide everything is pretty good. If corona pwned companies didnt drag the market down, we would be fucking FLYING. look at FB GOOG, etc, why would they go down? They are serving half the people in this world by now.

1) vaccine will be approved by end of 2020-- massive acceleration in timeline (donnie pump aint call it operation warp speed for nothing  


2) big tech valuations are justified:

a) longest lived assets in an insanely low yield environment-- literally unkillable companies that will dominate for the next couple of decades

b) even if the small tech companies valuations drop, big tech has massive cash pile to put to work and is in perfect place to scoop them up for cheap and load up for next bull market. these companies are perfect boltons for msft, goog, or amzn cloud business

3) comparison to dotcom bubble is silly-- 

a) cash/profitability: a lot of these tech companies are FCF positive (alteryx for example) and underlying profitability in terms of LTV:CAC are pristine for a lot of these SaaS companies which means they should

Someday when volatility drops back down and stocks stop moving like they have been earnings may become worth it again.

Some random ideas Ive had knocking around:

People keep talking about sector rotation but we likely won't see a true one until after coronavirus is really handled either by faking the numbers or having a vaccine so be weary of these mini pumps that only end up dumping within a weeks.

Financials will likely be depressed until we get higher interest rates so they will probably be depressed forever.

PTON and CHWY are dumb as shit but once the sell off has stabilized it might be good to keep an eye out for upward movement on these as investors don't know where to put their money and the big tech names are already super inflated.

JD seems really undervalued and it seems worth it to play them into earnings and maybe hold a few contracts through earnings.

Half the time financial media reports on the reasons for a market movement they're wrong. Half the financial media reports on the reasons for a market movement they're lying. A tenth of the time they're half right while also simultaneously being half wrong or lying.

That being said the soft bank thing is real in the sense that call to put ratio has been wildly inflated the past few months and calls on individual stocks have been at an all time high meaning other actors such as hedge funds have likely been doing the same strat as soft bank leading to a huge gamma squeeze but it probably wasnt just soft bank alone.

In the current market environment the macro trend will usually trump the trend of a specific stock, you can be right about a stock in particular but market sentiment is heavily affected by current sentiment on AAPL, TSLA, MSFT, AMZN, FB, and GOOG. Im not sure this is what happened to CHWY and PTON but it might have something to do with it. If there's a shift in the sentiment on the big guys its probably worth it to reposition on other stocks as well. That being said I think we're gonna have a little bit of optimism at the beginning of the next week on the big tech guys but I heard big banks have to do book keeping Q1 and Q3 so we might see some selling through the end of the week next week. My current prediction is green AF Monday followed by selling through Friday.

After that I think big tech will start to settle into a range and go flatish for a while and we'll see upward momentum in CHWY, PTON type stocks as well as chinese tech like JD. Maybe even GLD and SLV as investors will be looking for where to park their $$. Some people think we're gonna see Feb March type crash again. No. That will never happen again, it was a once in a life time thing and when it happens again it will be during a time when no one sees it coming and everyone has forgotten such a crash was even possible. I am doing my part by forgetting that its possible right now but it will likely be years before everybody has forgotten that its possible and then maybe we'll see another crash like that again but not any time soon.

Lastly all of this is probably bullshit and will end up being wrong the number one thing about these big picture thesis stuff is that you're always looking for why you might be wrong and/or why you might be right but you're early because market sentiment isn't going to catch up fast enough to be worth the theta you're burning. The other post I made I think has good mantras that are generally relevant but this post is mostly random predictions Im making about the future and people are almost always wrong when they try to predict the future, including me.

Also ZM is stupid as fuck but I'm not shorting it, it has retard strength and schools are using it now. But it sucks and it has hella competitors in its niche.

Sorry for rambling if theres anything important Ive said it's to be patient. The biggest advantage you have over an institutional trader is that institutional traders have to be in a position all the time, they are constantly trading like it's their job. Don't try to beat them at their job.

Either this meant aapl was going down or msft fb goog were gunna go up to match p/e’s. Historical p/e average for faamg is ~20.

Your first filter should be ""The company has survived their own sector for 5-10 years"".

Palantir?! You  ought to ask yourself some hard questions about why that appealed you. It sure wasn't their financials. In addition to never coming close to making money, their growth is shit. Oh, and they have a small customer base, the details of which they didn't disclose. So what was it? Was it the ""mystery"" around them? The vaguely sinister vibe? What caused you to think it was worth risking money on?

4,2020-10-11,"I do want to see your DD. Independent of my cost basis, Buying calls on a stock that previously traded in the $3 range when there's an all cash offer on the table for 7.35 simply makes no goddamn sense to me. I want to see your reasoning.
Scenarios as I see it:

1) Google deal closes. Call buyers above asking price become worthless.
2) Google deal fails. Fitbit will return to it's pre offer levels... Maybe a little higher because of the value of their new products but certainly not $7.35 because if the shareholders thought it was worth that much, see NXP and QCOM, fit would be currently trading above 7.35 today. Its not.
3) any call you buy above $7.35 might regain its IV but the subsequent breakup price would put the call farther out of the money than it is today.. more than negating any iv gain.

So what are you betting on? 
someone else coming in and offering more money than GOOG? If so, why wait? 

 I'm betting on a close instead of taking profits now and selling calls for extra bucks. I disclosed my position. Let's talk yours.

Ps. You were the one who said selling calls at $8 has a potential for disaster. I want to understand why. If you had believed it would close with this kind of administration in power, even buying a month ago at 15% off Google's asking price is a fair bet. Selling calls out of the money is no more additional risk.",wjean,wallstreetbets,4.0

I've been casually looking for the answer for 7 years. In fact, the closest thing I found was an article around the time they changed their name to Alphabet that specifically stated that their data footprint couldn't be calculated because even their servers couldn't be estimated.  Too many under too many names.

TLDR I believe the only reason GOOG isn't valued at AAPL  or AMZN levels is because they're better at hiding. They dgaf about punitive fines because they know it's a a fraction of what they gain by breaking the law,  even compared to other businesses.

3,2020-11-09,"I interviewed with them last year for a software solutions architect role.  


1. HR interview, passed with great remarks
2. Panel interview 3-4 hours, also passed with great remarks

At this point, HR told me they'd give me another date to fly into Mountainview, CA for an on-site final interview. However, they ghosted me and I never heard back.

Here's what you do for an automatic shoe-in.  


1. Be female (helps if you did *not* major in computer science)
2. Be Indian (specifically, Brahmin/Priest Caste)
   1. No this isn't dungeons and dragons, Indians are discriminatory as fuck; even within their own ethnic group
3. Be a combination of minority/female
   1. Black/female is the strongest mixed class
4. Be on an H1B visa, so they can hold you as an indentured servant and pay you less than their US citizen counterparts.
5. Be a Democrat

It is best not to play victim if you're not accepted, but it is important to be aware that tech companies are not a meritocracy and the allure of working for such organizations fades as you get older.

The reason being you realize that you can work less hours and in some cases make more without having to deal with all the PC crap that goes on (to a greater degree than other places).

6,2020-12-03,"TLDR basically a consulting company, also their software is behind the times compared to cutting edge stuff from GOOG/FB/MSFT in the same fields.

They masquerade as a software company but really they are basically just a consultancy that happens to have some reusable software they sell on the side.

Their financials are stupidly misleading. Sales and marketing account for like 1/3rd their expenses (R&amp;D and administration making up the rest), HOWEVER they have neither sales people (well they are getting some, currently accounts for 3% of head count) and 0 marketing folk.

So you might ask the question, where is all that fucking money going? Well, that is how they pay the consultants. Usually referred to as Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs) they are accounted for under sales and marketing despite being compensated like SV engineers and not being counted in COGS (this is why their gross margin of 80% is also stupidly misleading).

Even if you put all of this aside and assume they have some killer product I have some bad news for you. First of all it's not some magic box you just drop in and it just ""works out where your data is"". That is what the consultants primarily do, write custom integrations for all the bullshit DB2 systems and crap that needs to be ingested.
Then if you assume hey, you need to do that for all competitors too, yes that is true except you can hire -anyone- to do that, you aren't beholden to your vendor + integrator in one (PLTR).

Additionally their competitors just have vastly superior products. GOOG in particular is -FAR- in the lead of everyone, by a literal fucking mile. BigQuery alone dumpsters all things like it (not to mention all things like it are actually copies of it based on the Google Dremel paper). That is without factoring Dataflow, AI Platform, etc. You could argue Data Studio is shit but GOOG doesn't lock you into that, you can go get Looker which is best in class and connect that to BigQuery.

They are a government contractor. If you wouldn't invest in a baby Raytheon or Lockheed then don't invest in PLTR.

Caveats: They could in theory change their product and business model into a more growth friendly package. Eliminate the need for their consultants, preferably make a cloud hosted option of their DB + frontend available, switch to a more traditional sales model that works outside of government etc.

However i am not banking on them doing any of that because if they could have they would have done it 10 years ago.",beefstake,wallstreetbets,6.0

0,2020-12-12,Agreed on GOOG sucking at almost everything outside the core business. Time well tell. The point was Google is just the first. Apple sees it too and you bet the monopolists will natively integrate(read: shove down users throats) more competition.,t33po,wallstreetbets,0.0

2,2020-12-12,Analyzing data the way PLTR does is not a scalable business in the same way that Goog or SNOW is. Every data set they are contracted to work with is different and will likely be requiring custom software to ingest it into their systems. It’s more similar to high powered consulting work from Mckinsey. i.e. not capable of rapid growth without significant head count which requires large salary costs.,lilolmilkjug,wallstreetbets,2.0
