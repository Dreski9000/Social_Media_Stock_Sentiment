0,2018-05-03,"Unlike COD and Overwatch, Fortnite is free to play witch means every kid ever will play it witch witch leads to a steady decline in sale for other games. Epic Games is also way better at making kids spend a bunch of money on in-game shit. They also have fewer employees and less maintenance costs for their games.

Meanwhile Activision have nu clue how to adapt to the market and been actively fucking up their well established brands for a pretty long time. The new World of Warcraft expansion being released this fall is basically guaranteed to print them money for a while though but I won’t be holding shit until then.",Dampbarn,wallstreetbets,0.0
