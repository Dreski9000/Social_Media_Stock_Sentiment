2,2021-01-10,"&gt; Bruh, that's not what you were saying... you were saying resolution and MP had no relation...

These are my exact quotes.

&gt; I also dislike their autonomous announcement, camera megapixels are irrelevant. (to autonomous driving)



&gt; It’s no longer true that the higher a camera’s megapixel count the better. (for resolution)

&gt;Resolution isn't tied to megapixels, you can have a 2MP camera that captures in 1080p

NIO having an 8MP to Teslas 2MP is incredibly irrelevant. Improving resolution does nothing past a certain point other than waste resources, the human eye can barely differentiate between 4k and 8k, a computer can deal with 360p easy.

There are Robotaxis in the world right now, Waymo is running their HD mapped Lidar system in geofenced areas. Tesla's FSD is really impressive and is likely orders of magnitude safer than a human. Having said that, the main benefit of FSD is public transport, Robotaxis seem dumb to me while that isn't implemented, how cheap could buses be without a driver? Tesla/Waymo/NIO don't seem to care about it, not even Comma.ai talk about it.

It will likely never be perfect but the demand is there already, people are spending $8k to have it included with their Teslas even though its illegal to use in most scenarios. NIO is trying to get revenue from an incomplete product that won't be ready for years. At least NIOs is recurring and can be cancelled unlike Tesla (again, great deal for the consumer, not for NIO)",ConCueta,wallstreetbets,2.0

7,2021-02-12,"I had offers from Open Door, Offer Pad and Zillow.

Offer Pad's inspector was NOT qualified to do inspections, she took pictures on an ipad and they concluded the inspection at the office. Came back with a bunch of bullshit, they wanted to replace the south facing front door because the paint was fading, they wanted to replace a bathroom sink because there was a small stain on it, they wanted to resurface the less than 10 year old pebble-tech pool because it had some fading, etc. I don't remember the exact figures, I can't find the documents, but they wanted something like $35K in repairs. And their offer was lower than Open Door to begin with. Zillow's offer was a non-starter, it was lower than Offer Pad's final price without even quoting me any repairs.

Open Door's inspector was an experienced home inspector and explained a number of things to me, he told me they have a buffer built into the offer price for repairs so small things he's noting I won't even hear about, and that was true. He told me I didn't have to leave the fridge behind, which I didn't realize because it came with the house, so now I have a garage fridge. They also sent out a roofing company to inspect the roof, and a pool company to inspect the pool

He told me that if he came in after I moved out and found ceiling fans missing, he'd just put a cap on the wires and call it a day, I wasn't a total asshole, I went to HD and bought the cheapest fans and replaced my fancy ones.

They finally requested $880 credit for repairs (pool pump, siding, paint for my office that had a non-neutral paint). And they allowed me to leave my storage pod in the driveway for a few days after the sale as we were still finalizing the next house. I went back to get the pod and the pressure washing guy was there, and then I went back a few times to get the mail that hasn't been forwarded properly yet, and sure enough the pool pump was fixed (raised off the ground, leaky pipe fixed, broken valves replaced), the siding was replaced, and from the listing pictures I see that they repainted the office and bathroom, and they patched nail holes in all the walls.

So final amount transferred to me was Offer price - 5% service charge - $880.00 repairs.

Mind you you don't have to deal with any realtors, so that 5% (6% even) service charge would have been spent on realtors going a traditional route anyway. I didn't have to worry about showings or bargaining with buyers, they sent a notary to my house with the paperwork that needed to be wet signed, everything else was signed electronically, and I had my money wired to my account the next day.

I don't plan to sell this house anytime soon, but if I do I will absolutely give them the opportunity to give me an offer before going anywhere else.",Zargawi,wallstreetbets,7.0

If you say waymo is ahead you do not understand how fundamentally different the two approaches are, neither of them is ahead because theyre trying to achieve different things - tesla wants autonomous vehicles at scale where the average consumer can be driven by your vehicle anywhere, waymo wants a niche taxi service ran by themselves in few specific locations, this is based on looking like 5 years into the future and waymo is already there, so in a way you can say waymo is ahead because their systems capabilities give them very little ambition. So yes, please do do some research, its not even that hard all you have to do is understand how lidar and HD maps work and you will instantly understand the insanity of scaling a method such as this to even the entirety of the US, this is what YOU want out of waymo but they have much different views because they understand their limitations.",Jmod_pls_respond,wallstreetbets,42.0

1,2021-07-12,I think we are going to see a big swing up through eod tomorrow. Possibly an end of day pullback or open down before Jpow. I Think the Fed is trapped into easy money so I am expecting a dovish tone. Spy should rebound any dip and shoot through 440. I believe bank earnings will be positive. TSMC earnings will pull AMD and MU back up. I see a lot of money flowing into AAPL and FB before earnings and wouldn't be surprised to see AAPL at 155 and FB at 390 at the end of July. I think we see SPY close July at 460.  Retailers should also have strong earnings and I'm thinking HD and LOW set new highs and TGT and SBUX also shine. Inflation should pull up oil stocks and I can see SPY reaching 470 end of aug.,holdingtankers,wallstreetbets,1.0

Do you think it will still be innovating and making lots of money? I do. How about HD? KO? I would look into some energy stocks too. Collect 8% with EPD and MMP. Look at SU. How about some real estate too? VICI and NRZ pay you fat dividends. Maybe a bit of sin? MO pays 8%. If your horizon is longer, buy VTI, IMW and SCHD. Hold for decades. Retire rich.

0,2021-12-06,"Slow and steady wins the race. One strategy that has worked for me:  buy well-covered dividend/distribution stocks, collect the money as you wait for growth. AGNC, DX, NRZ and PTY are REIT companies that pay fat dividends. EPD and MMP are natural gas infrastructure stocks that reliably pay 8% or better. Undervalued too. KO only pays 3% but is a slimmer, more focused behemoth than it was pre-Covid (when it hit $60). Buy at $53, collect $ and watch it go back to $60 and maybe more. HD is also a great company. And look at no-dividend stocks like AMZN. With its culture of innovation and cloud-based services (AWS), do you think they will be much more valuable 5 years from now? I do. Forget options on companies with silly valuations. Or ignore this sober (well, 4 beers) Sunday advice and post more loss porn. Folks here live for it.",livemusicisbest,wallstreetbets,0.0

0,2021-12-08,"I should've been a little bit more specific, sorry.

I started out with 40k savings, and bought almost all AAPL/MSFT/QQQ shares in 2016 and held until now. A lot of those stocks have gotten 400%+ gains over the 5 years. Then every paycheck I got throughout the years, I kept putting money into stocks into a mixed ratio of safe stocks vs high-risk stocks. I would always make sure that I was allocating most of my portfolio into safe stocks, and a small portion into riskier option plays. I would never risk more than 5-10% of my portfolio on option plays / earnings plays / meme stocks / what have you. I made some big mistakes on options, and made some gains on options. In the end I think I only profited a little bit, and I still have a ways to go when it comes to learning how to be a better options trader. However, my ""long term"" stocks have mostly always gone up, and by safe I mean I was periodically buying AMD, TSLA, NVDA, HD, FB through the years on top of the FAANG that I already had and \*never\* selling. I misspoke when I said I turned 40K into 400K. It was more like I started with 40K, and kept adding money in (from my paychecks) and buying brand-name stocks until my portfolio rose to 400K. In the end I think out of the 400K total amount, almost 100k of it was my own capital from the money I saved from my paychecks from 2016-now (which includes the 40K I started with). The rest were gains. I know this goes against the entire WSB mantra of YOLO-ing everything but at the end of the day, long term stocks are rewarding with patience. The YOLO part is all fun but \*extremely\* high risk and may not be the best idea if you can't handle big losses. Hope that makes sense",AshamedEstate1974,wallstreetbets,0.0

Also a case for great relative value. So far this year it has lagged way behind similar businesses like TGT COST HD LOW etc which have all done exceptionally well.

I started all the way back on the WEEKLY chart satisfying a little curiosity looking at long term performance vs TGT/COST/DG/HD/LOW etc (WMT really underperforming recently - looks like it could be lagging behind ready to catch up) and noticed pretty strong long term support along the 100 WEEK sma which it was right on then. Zoomed into the daily and saw the 135 support level which it’s been banging up against for a while, then into the inter-day to see 136 as the more granular recent support level, all the way to the intraday yesterday where I was able to grab it after it did a little dip and rip move right under 136 and then back up over vwap and eventually the open.

But even LOW vs HD, HD has 2.5x the market cap as LOW, but less than 2x the revenue, less than 2x the income, and HALF of the income growth rate YoY as LOW. COST is too high here too. Good luck OP!
