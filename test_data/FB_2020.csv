8,2020-02-12,"Semi-DD on new positions:
I’m thinking both QQQ and MSFT could take a few days to consolidate before climbing again. Also thinking the overall climate is bullish but we have a few risk factors for short term setbacks in play so I don’t want to run weeklies right now.

I bought $4.7k of AAPL calls today (4x 3/20 $320c) at an average of $11.89 when they were slightly ITM. I feel AAPL has some catching up to do vs. MSFT or QQQ and it tends to grow more consistently than GOOG/FB/AMZN/NFLX. Thought about TSM and tech ETFs but chose to just get more AAPL. It then went on sale after the news on regulatory scrutiny (reviewing all big tech mergers?) and the galaxy $1000 pricing announcement so I’m down ~$600. Anyone who wants to join in, this looks like an easy long play became even easier with the discount. I plan to carry this call until it’s about a week from expiry and see what Tim brings me.

I also took ~$1k of positions each in SPCE and PCG. 3x 3/20 SPCE 20c @$3.60 and 10x 3/20 PCG 20c @$1.03. I’m currently flat on those taken together, up a bit on SPCE and down a bit on PCG. 

SPCE is an interesting meme stock with a lot of chatter on here. Because the space tourism business is one of a kind on public markets and Sir Branson is going to not only be the president but also a client, a lot of long term and LEAPS buyers are getting in so it’s not as pump-and-dump as for instance DEAC. To the moon!

PCG is a California utility company that is on track to escape bankruptcy so share prices have been increasing steadily. Their ATH was $71.57 in 2017, and they dropped to ~$45 through October 2018 when they were engrossed in a huge wildfire settlement that ultimately looked likely to drive them to bankruptcy. The all time low was $3.55 just back in October 2019 when bankruptcy looked imminent. There were a lot of swings as the government decided whether to burn them to the ground or not. They now have reached a final settlement on the wildfires that leaves them solvent, and the stock has been strongly appreciating since then. There have been quite a few quality DD posts on PCG here over the last few months and the general sentiment is bullish.",johntaylor37,wallstreetbets,8.0

22,2020-02-11,"you can sell them whenever. they don't even need to hit the strike. For example, consider FB. It was trading at \~225 right before earnings(1/29). The probability of it reaching 230 then was really high. So the call expiring on 04/17 (yes April) was valued $8.38 (8.38\*100=838). Two weeks after earnings, we find FB trading at 208 as of today and the same option is valued at $2.01 (2.01\*100=201). Now if you think that FB has settled from post earnings up-downs and can potentially go up from this point, you can take an entry here with your 230 calls expiring on 4/17. Even if FB goes up to just 215 by end of Feb, your calls will be making money. You can sell the call by March 1st week and potentially take 25-50% profit if we continue with this bull run.

If a merger is small enough, you skip most of the red tape, as in nothing is reported.

Today the FTC announced that they are going to investigate all small mergers FAAAM (FB, Apple, AMZN, Alphabet, Microsoft) made since 2010.  They suspect that FAAAM has been abusing this to gut competition.  

I say the dip is fake because Microsoft is gunna quietly walk away from this squeaky clean  while attention is on FB, Amazon, and Google.  Apple will also get off without much trouble but they'll get a lot of attention.",KarmaKill23,wallstreetbets,57.0

MSFT: Nokia

Apple: Beats, Intel cell modem

Amazon: whole foods

FB: WhatsApp, Instagram

Google: YouTube, double click, Motorola, Waze

Seems like MSFT/Apple look pretty clean here, Amazon a bit less so but definitely more vertical purchase structure. However, FB and Google's are more horizontal - purchasing direct competitors to their products. Think that will be a focus.

UPDATE: FTC to investigate 'hundreds' of past acquisitions made by Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook

 

Agency seeks information on smaller deals that did not receive scrutiny at the time, chairman says that process could lead to 'unwinding' of some of the mergers

Antitrust regulators widened their investigatory net into the top of the technology industry Tuesday, including [Microsoft Corp](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=205778). for the first time.

The Federal Trade Commission announced ([https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/02/ftc-examine-past-acquisitions-large-technology-companies)it](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/02/ftc-examine-past-acquisitions-large-technology-companies)it) plans to examine past acquisitions from Microsoft (MSFT), Google parent company [Alphabet Inc](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=140864). (GOOGL)(GOOGL), [Apple Inc](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=36276). (AAPL), [Amazon.com Inc](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=45294). (AMZN), and [Facebook Inc](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&amp;issue=45563793). (FB) The agency wants information from the five companies, which have a market value of more than $5 trillion, on their corporate purchases dating back to the beginning of 2010 that did not undergo scrutiny from the federal government under the Hart-Scott-Rodino, or HSR, Act.

For more: Expect Big Tech antitrust talk to continue in 2020, but action is far from guaranteed ([http://www.marketwatch.com/story/regulating-big-tech-was-mostly-talk-in-2019-expect-the-same-in-2020-2019-12-27](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/regulating-big-tech-was-mostly-talk-in-2019-expect-the-same-in-2020-2019-12-27))

In a conference call with reporters, FTC Chairman Joseph Simons deemed the request a study not related to law enforcement actions but an attempt to better understand the flood of transactions that are not reportable under HSR. He said there is no financial threshold for the size of the horizontal and vertical deals it plans to look at. The request grew out of the FTC's hearing last year on transaction activity among tech companies, he added.

He said the FTC would focus on deals of companies that could have potentially developed into larger businesses, and moves by tech giants that increased their influence in adjacent markets. Simons said the number of deals under scrutiny is in the ""hundreds,"" and could lead to the ""unwinding"" of some of the mergers.

""It is important to keep tech markets open and competitive,"" Simons said on the conference call.

See also: Four reasons why antitrust actions will likely fail to break up Big Tech ([http://www.marketwatch.com/story/breaking-up-big-tech-is-a-big-task-2019-06-10](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/breaking-up-big-tech-is-a-big-task-2019-06-10))

""The orders will help the FTC deepen its understanding of large technology firms' acquisition activity, including how these firms report their transactions to the federal antitrust agencies, and whether large tech companies are making potentially anticompetitive acquisitions of nascent or potential competitors that fall below HSR filing thresholds and therefore do not need to be reported to the antitrust agencies,"" the agency said in its announcement of the investigation ([https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/02/ftc-examine-past-acquisitions-large-technology-companies](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/02/ftc-examine-past-acquisitions-large-technology-companies)).

The FTC's probe intensifies the heat on Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook, all of which have been under the piercing eyes of the federal government as well as European authorities for their competitive tactics, as they cement dominant market positions and delve into new areas of business. Microsoft, however, had escaped any scrutiny after surviving its own antitrust fight with the government in the days of the dot-com boom and bust ([http://www.marketwatch.com/story/big-tech-was-built-by-the-same-type-of-antitrust-actions-that-could-now-tear-it-down-2019-06-12](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/big-tech-was-built-by-the-same-type-of-antitrust-actions-that-could-now-tear-it-down-2019-06-12)).

The antitrust suspects: Facebook and Apple appear to be most at risk ([http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-antitrust-suspects-facebook-and-apple-appear-to-be-most-at-risk-2019-06-18](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-antitrust-suspects-facebook-and-apple-appear-to-be-most-at-risk-2019-06-18))

The companies' larger acquisitions are typically approved by the FTC before they close. Facebook's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, Google's purchases of YouTube and DoubleClick, and Amazon's merger with Whole Foods all received clearance from the FTC before closing.

However, Big Tech makes myriad smaller deals every year that are never announced and do not go through regulatory channels. For instance, Google closed on a $2.4 billion acquisition of software company Looker ([http://www.marketwatch.com/story/google-agrees-to-pay-big-money-for-big-data-startup-looker-2019-06-06](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/google-agrees-to-pay-big-money-for-big-data-startup-looker-2019-06-06)) in 2019 and agreed to purchase Fitbit for $2.1 billion ([http://www.marketwatch.com/story/google-to-purchase-fitbit-for-21-billion-as-it-beefs-up-its-health-capabilities-2019-11-01](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/google-to-purchase-fitbit-for-21-billion-as-it-beefs-up-its-health-capabilities-2019-11-01)) -- a deal that is still under review -- but also spent $1 billion to acquire other companies that the company does not name in its annual filing.

Apple largely avoids big-name acquisitions, but has spent more than $1.6 billion in the past three fiscal years on business acquisitions, according to its annual filing, and Chief Executive Tim Cook has said that Apple is buying a smaller company about every two to three weeks on average ([https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/06/apple-buys-a-company-every-few-weeks-says-ceo-tim-cook.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/06/apple-buys-a-company-every-few-weeks-says-ceo-tim-cook.html)).

""There are no adequate checks and balances on what these companies can do,"" Anamitra Deb, senior director of beneficial technology at the Omidyar Network, told MarketWatch in a phone interview. ""Years of being under-regulated made them less accountable. Mature tech companies at large scale need guardrails in the form of antitrust, more stringent privacy laws, and corporate governance.""

Big tech's dominance was the focus at a public workshop on venture capital and antitrust at Stanford University on Wednesday. ""Dynamic competition should drive markets. Investment should go to the best ideas. Disruption can create consumer value,"" Makan Delrahim, assistant attorney general, antitrust division of Department of Justice, said in opening remarks. ""These are the principles I've continually returned to.""

Shares in all five companies dipped in intraday trading immediately following the FTC's announcement. None of the five companies immediately responded to email messages seeking comment.

A Microsoft spokesman late Tuesday said. ""We look forward to working with the FTC to answer their questions.""

Amazon spokesman Jay Carney told CNBC on Wednesday that the Seattle-based company will cooperate with the FTC.",minigunman123,wallstreetbets,6.0

I have been using Degiro (Europe) as a platform (I mainly buy and hold stuff, never traded call &amp; puts), and today when trying to see what Leveraged Product they have, they list the following for FB:

FACEBOOK SL 227.8525 HB 10.03 FN 227.8525 R 10.00 Vontobel BEST Turbo Short

FACEBOOK SL 175.7193 HB 6.58 FN 175.7193 R 10.00 Vontobel BEST Turbo Long

(note there are many of these product with SL varying from 123 to 240$).

The problem is the the f35 is a jobs program like the sls program is, so the senators don't care if it takes 30 years to roll out a new replacement jet.

Also why should we be  stuck with one design, and fucking disregard any competive design?

Musk is right, we're past the era of purely manned dog fighters and the future is AI with a human moderator.

I didn’t trade again until January 2019. Put my account all in on a bunch of OTM FB calls right before a monstrous earnings report. Again around  300-400% trade.

Sat out of the market until I read about this covid news and then threw down on puts in stocks with high beta or whatever the fuck it’s called. Made great gains once again.

the Great Depression repeated again would punish the working class, in practical terms, far more than the rich. the rich might take bigger net worth losses in nominal terms, but think about who this matters more to: Chad, who's net worth dropped from $10M to $7.5M and he's still fucking your girl, or you, who's net worth was already just 1 free FB stock you got for referring a friend to Robinhood, and now you're unemployed because your company went under and you have no savings cushion.

There are (a) the actual corporations and partnership politicians that act as a single unit to transfer money from the Govt. to their private concerns (basically, the lobbiest/politician/shareholder circle of graft), and then (b) the other corporations, and the idea of a modern corporation. 

Nothing changes for (a), that's a legal/political thing that judging by the recent American political news will not be changing in our lifetime. (b) is really interesting, because when you look into corporations you realise they evolve to adapt to the times just as much as living organisms do. And if you look at marketing, this current evolution is to try and generate meaningful relationships to customers, cultivating openness, transparency, an actual moral stance that isn't corrupted for money. 

You can see this play out right now with Zoom and their FB IDE leak. People want to be able to trust a company. Look at Valve, they have a totally flat structure, amazing products, incredible fan base and also seem like a great place to work at. Having hierarchies reduces corporate accountability and makes horrible decisions easier to make, it's possible to say 'we were only following orders' (to maximise shareholder profits), even though that attitude at FB caused a mini genocide. Having a flat, open structure means you can't do bad things so easily. Also the awareness that scale-up is a meaningless metric, having a small, core team of around a hundred people is better than having divisions of people that don't know each other. 

Basically the exact opposite of (a) is the future of corporations, small, dynamic, accountable, personable, focused on single services and products, working tight knit.",kingpubcrisps,wallstreetbets,7.0

The mother of all was I grabbed 3 5/4 275p’s for SPY right at close thinking Monday is red with Asia and Europe reentering the scene (all but UK and HK were closed today), and most likely (hopefully) selling off Sunday night to play catch up on us today.

I just don't think well reach pre corona levels for awhile tbh, can't see the market moving too much in either direction tbh over the next month. But if you can play it right, when the market has a green dildo day, sell the calls. Don't worry about making a profit, it's a sunk cost. Worst thing you can do (which I did but got lucky) is not sell high thinking it might go higher, and then it tanks to potentially even lower than where it was before. Diamond hands are overrated, especially with options. if you are a believer in those companies and the options spike, sell them, and keep track of the options. i guarantee theyll drop again before long and you can buy them again, perhaps at a different strike/date.

19,2020-05-02,"This sort of discussion is why r/investing finds WSB a joke. But I still love my WSB memes.

\- It's clearly overvalued, even a fully retarded understanding of FA will show you that.Even after the recent drop it's valued at around 40x REVENUES (LOL), not EARNINGS. Other tech stocks have nowhere near these valuations. FB has a revenue multiple of around 8. Difference is FB and other stocks actually have a decent chunk of revenue converted ( and will continue to be converted to revenue) to EARNINGS. ZM has almost ZERO prospects of converting even a fraction of this revenue into earnings due to :

\- Bigger,better competition with massive amounts of capital to invest compared to ZOOM. Google, MSFT, FB, CISCO, ADOBE. Do you really think that if there was that much money to be made in the videoconferencing sector ZM will even have any significant market share a short time from now?  What kind of earnings or margin do you see be made on this small market share, if any? These companies have just cloned what worked for Zoom and offered it for free through their existing interlinked platforms. Offered a similar ( and eventually better) product for FREE, not a great investment thesis for ZM longer term. Video conferencing is NOT a high tech, heavily patented sector, it's essentially freeware longer term. The software development is basic and we wouldn't even be talking about Zoom if it wasn't for beer aids. 

\- Beer aids has peaked, at least fear of it has. People will start going back to offices around the world soon, no long term thesis for zoom's current price. One of the first things struggling businesses and companies cut during downturns is non-essential IT expenses, so like I said, even if you think a recession/possibly depression is likely (I do) you would cut zoom use across the company and move to a free platform.

\-ZM was clearly a meme stock bought buy poor , first time normies or mum and dad investors that was happily dumped on them shortly after the IPO. Fuck me, to get and idea of the average investor just remember that ZOOM ticker mooned because investors didn't even bother to check the right ticker for this pile of shit and bought the wrong company. ZOOM trading was even suspended lol. Being a med-long investor on ZM is like flying a booking a spaceflight where everyone on the vessel including the flight crew tell you BEFOREHAND that they are mongoloids but you still buy a ticket anyway. 

\- Security issues, zoombombing, shit load of existing tech companies exploiting the shit out of these stuff ups as they ramp up their own products. The power google,FB and others have using their advertising budget and other media platforms to promote their own product shouldn't be underestimated - just look at the propaganda that been put out by big tech the last few days.

\- Friday was just a tiny dead cat bounce with people taking profits and/or some market makers covering their spreads on expiration, the drop was anticipated but happened a bit quicker than many were expecting imo. That's my retards opinion on the open interest and the put/call ratio activity anyway. There where a shit load of calls on this and still are that are now way OTM and will expiry useless over the next couple of weeks and have already.

&amp;#x200B;

\- How many more reasons do you need? This is WSB, Elon bipolar rant over. Iv'e been short on this dumpster fire since the 7% below the top, mostly unbalanced butterflys and backspreads and I even gone full retard at points and just bought straight puts occasionally. They have been printing but to be honest I feel a bit sorry for the mum and dad investors who bought this cos they saw their kids using the app - they are not stupid, probably smarter than me most of them- but they have been handed this pile of shit by CNBC and analysts who work for the same banks that made fees on the IPO and selling on the spike.",sofarsogood84,wallstreetbets,19.0

I wouldn't have taken a bet on tsla or amd because that was way too uncertain. At that time Intel was doing great and amd was basically dumpster for both GPU and CPUs

I remember they had a good run again the pentium III with their Athlon 64 at the time but then Intel came back at them with their own multicore and outdid AMD. Nvidia was also pumping much better GFs than AMD, or at least their drivers were much better which in turn made the GFs great

In the case of TSLA it was really david vs goliath in that they were trying to enter a market with huge players with very little growth within the market itself. Of course within the EV space there was huge growth opportunities but why would TSLA be the one and not Toyota or VW or you name it huge conglomerate.

They were also burning cash for years. I mean when people were buying at 300 in 2017 they still had no prospect for future profits just yet

FB on the other hand only had to find a way to monetize their huge userbase. But i guess the uncertainty was that it could go bust like MySpace or smth.

In any case i wasn't into stonks back in 2011/2012 and if i were i wouldve not had the good mindset anyways.

35,2020-05-03,"I used one metric as this is WSB and I don't want to cause any aneurysms. But please, show me what metric could possible justify the share price?

The P/E is currently around 1800! I can't believe I'm bothering to answer this, I'm partially assuming your trolling.

Lets be extremely optimistic and assume that ALL of zooms sales (revenue) gets converted entirely into profit - ie giving them a ridiculously high and unwarranted profit margin. It still gives a P/E of 40! + This is still much higher than FB,GOOG and MSFT?

Are you seriously suggesting that ZM is a company that justifies a earning multiple higher than these juggernauts? 

Back to the real world, the latest march 10K gives a net profit margin of 4% (net income/revenue as a pecentage). That is NOWHERE near what it needs to be.

The companies that maybe investment worthy at a P/S ratio of 40 are only so because, at some stage in the future, (see your MSFT's or FB's in the very early days) they are fully expected to be able to produce significant profits on their revenue. ZM has near zero chance of doing this well. It's priced as if its the next FB, or Google and clearly its not.

You say that this company has a moat and speak of the network effect, word of mouth and so on that will be positive for zoom. Do you not realize that bigger players have entire business platform solutions that are already well established subscription models? MSFT has Teams, Office 365 and OneNote for schoools ( not that zm will make any real money out of schools anyway - even though it's likely near 100m of their daily free student users will be using their infrastructure at a cost) . Google has Gsuite and so many others. Not only that, several competitors to zoom own the cloud infrastructure that ZM relies on, and use their own cloud systems to host the videoconferencing software on the cheap! How do those margins look now?

How about the network effect of businesses already using MSFT platforms or google solutions that are free? What about Adobe promoting gotomeetings through it's well known brand? Sure, in the very short term and especially when the user isn't paying anything yet Zoom will get it's name out there but as soon as they try to ask users to pay for something which is basically a commodity ( videoconferencing service/platform) they will see massive churn to the other players. This is why these other services are being offered for free by google/msft and so on; they are of no real value except as add-on to their existing business platforms/subscription models. Many-participant videoconferencing  has been around for at least 15 years, at minimum. 

Do yourself a favor and add up the entire profit all of those companies no one except you has ever heard of before, 8x8, Vonage, RingCentral . By my quick estimate you get less than $300m (some are losing money), as a comparison ZM made 22m last year. Now imagine a world where coronavirus is treatable and a vaccine is developed and there is no more hype around the virus and zoom. Now go back and take a look at the market cap of these companies that no one will ever hear of and compare it to ZM's market cap, (after!) the recent fall, of say $39 billion. Can you still tell me with a straight face that zm is worth anywhere near $135 a share?

&amp;#x200B;

If you can find a more obvious short ( in the med-long term, I'm not talking meme rallies, normies averaging down or dead cat bounces) than  Zoom please let everyone know!

Tech? We've seen over and over how 1 guy in a garage can come along and completely destroy the dominant player in the field. Which is why FB, Google etc. snap up the new companies like crack, stop them taking the top spot. Which is expensive, the constant R&amp;D and asset purchases take a huge chunk of capital.

Compare that to Railroads for example. Think of what a company would have to do to unseat BNSF. Literally re-rail half of the country, and then they'd have to win against a company that didn't just spend a trillion dollars and has been gaining experience for 100+ years.

Sure there's some good info here and there posted now and again. But nothing like years prior. I've never had anyone ask about options for example over the years, last 12 months or so, I've had multiple friends asking.

14,2020-05-04,"50% patience, and 50% luck is a good estimation.

Patience is important because otherwise you will FOMO into a bad position. Patience is critical.

I almost FOMO'd into a FB call and would have lost HARD. I didn't buy in because I KNEW that they had already gained 6% in a day and it was overbought on the RSI chart.

So I had a feeling that they would drop, and waiver for a few days. That exactly happened, I just kept watching and when I thought they were done wavering, I bought in. Initially I was down a little and I was thinking of getting out and stop-lossing but I decided to trust my gut and it made an 8-9% gain in the next 2 days.

&amp;#x200B;

That single trade allowed me to be EVEN MORE patient (or try to). But days like today are really hard. I wanted to play ZOOM, ROKU, CloudFlare, and ETSY to earnings but I MISSED OUT today so I am now just sitting and waiting to see IF I have a buying opportunity.

If I don't I am not going to FOMO in and get theta crushed. I would rather miss out vs. putting myself in a bad position to lose money. I like predictability and don't have a high tolerance to loss though.",Investinwaffl3s,wallstreetbets,14.0

Analyst (piper sandler) came out with a 144$ estimate and neutral stance ( rofl ) today that's why we are seeing the dead cat bounce:

Original post:

 

This sort of discussion is why [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) finds WSB a joke. But I still love my WSB memes.

\-  It's clearly overvalued, even a fully retarded understanding of FA will  show you that.Even after the recent drop it's valued at around 40x  REVENUES (LOL), not EARNINGS. Other tech stocks have nowhere near these  valuations. FB has a revenue multiple of around 8. Difference is FB and  other stocks actually have a decent chunk of revenue converted ( and  will continue to be converted to revenue) to EARNINGS. ZM has almost  ZERO prospects of converting even a fraction of this revenue into  earnings due to :

\- Bigger,better  competition with massive amounts of capital to invest compared to ZOOM.  Google, MSFT, FB, CISCO, ADOBE. Do you really think that if there was  that much money to be made in the videoconferencing sector ZM will even  have any significant market share a short time from now?  What kind of  earnings or margin do you see be made on this small market share, if  any? These companies have just cloned what worked for Zoom and offered  it for free through their existing interlinked platforms. Offered a  similar ( and eventually better) product for FREE, not a great  investment thesis for ZM longer term. Video conferencing is NOT a high  tech, heavily patented sector, it's essentially freeware longer term.  The software development is basic and we wouldn't even be talking about  Zoom if it wasn't for beer aids.

\-  Beer aids has peaked, at least fear of it has. People will start going  back to offices around the world soon, no long term thesis for zoom's  current price. One of the first things struggling businesses and  companies cut during downturns is non-essential IT expenses, so like I  said, even if you think a recession/possibly depression is likely (I do)  you would cut zoom use across the company and move to a free platform.

\-ZM  was clearly a meme stock bought buy poor , first time normies or mum  and dad investors that was happily dumped on them shortly after the IPO.  Fuck me, to get and idea of the average investor just remember that  ZOOM ticker mooned because investors didn't even bother to check the  right ticker for this pile of shit and bought the wrong company. ZOOM  trading was even suspended lol. Being a med-long investor on ZM is like  flying a booking a spaceflight where everyone on the vessel including  the flight crew tell you BEFOREHAND that they are mongoloids but you  still buy a ticket anyway.

\-  Security issues, zoombombing, shit load of existing tech companies  exploiting the shit out of these stuff ups as they ramp up their own  products. The power google,FB and others have using their advertising  budget and other media platforms to promote their own product shouldn't  be underestimated - just look at the propaganda that been put out by big  tech the last few days.

\- Friday  was just a tiny dead cat bounce with people taking profits and/or some  market makers covering their spreads on expiration, the drop was  anticipated but happened a bit quicker than many were expecting imo.  That's my retards opinion on the open interest and the put/call ratio  activity anyway. There where a shit load of calls on this and still are  that are now way OTM and will expiry useless over the next couple of  weeks and have already.

\-  How many more reasons do you need? This is WSB, Elon bipolar rant over.  Iv'e been short on this dumpster fire since the 7% below the top,  mostly unbalanced butterflys and backspreads and I even gone full retard  at points and just bought straight puts occasionally. They have been  printing but to be honest I feel a bit sorry for the mum and dad  investors who bought this cos they saw their kids using the app - they  are not stupid, probably smarter than me most of them- but they have  been handed this pile of shit by CNBC and analysts who work for the same  banks that made fees on the IPO and selling on the spike.",sofarsogood84,wallstreetbets,42.0

I was super-excited, had all of the right clothes to wear, and was definitely looking forward to flossing the new-and-improved me.  The first party was definitely cool, as I felt my way around, filled with nervousness and anticipation.  I laughed off the fact I didn't actually go home with a woman that first night, or even get a number, or even talk to a woman, but I had a nice buzz and was prepared for my next shot.   It was kind of like my bet on Dominoes this earning's season, in hindsight it didn't work out, but I had done the research and looked forward to the next round.

The next few parties in college, I began to resent how easy it seemed to be for everybody else to have a good time, and get apparently what I was looking for.  I was beginning to get less and less optimistic, and that initial sense of euphoria and confidence was slowly turning into self-loathing and the feeling of petulance of not belonging there.  As I bet AMZN and MSFT this earnings season, the same feeling became me.  Why didn't I just click on FB instead, why did I blow $1600 on an expiring weekend SPY Put.  None of it makes sense, to anybody.  

Eventually at the end of my freshman year, I realized that parties weren't for me, and maybe I'm just a weirdo.  Maybe earnings aren't for me either, but I could just be broke.  In either event, I have no business being there or here.",Singleguywithacat,wallstreetbets,16.0

22,2020-05-06,"Lately I've heard people describing it as a market in denial, which seems fairly accurate.  There is one important caveat though - the big tech cap stocks have held up and their percentage of the indexes has grown dramatically during this bear market while many sectors remain in bear market or at least correction territory.  


Likely this is a big factor because market participants have yet to price in the possibility of an earnings contraction in big tech - possibly because the surge in activity due to stay at home orders has caused a usage spike that makes them appear a beneficiary.    


This is where a major inefficiency lies.  Advertising budgets (GOOGL, FB), corporate spend (MSFT), and discretionary spending (AMZN, AAPL) will start to dry up in the next few quarters.

43,2020-05-07,"As insane as that sounds, I've actually considered ""never"" a real answer based on the last two months.  It's hypothetical that infinite QE and bailouts can keep everything else afloat, but tech can be where you store your money.
What could happen is the tech sector just keeps gaining more and more weight on the S&amp;P until the rest of the economy detaches.  It's been happening over the last 10 years anyways (look at the weight of the top 10 stocks and their weight):

Components of the S&amp;P 500
1	MSFT	5.797789%
2	AAPL	5.225232%
3	AMZN	4.058672%
4	FB	        2.095516%
5	GOOGL	1.6998%
6	GOOG	1.698007%
7	JNJ	        1.654638%
8	BRK.B	1.447993%
9	Visa        1.284256%
10	PG	        1.216921%

It's simple - all of these favored tech companies are helping the gov't to help control the people.  It's the only explanaymtion that makes any fucking sense.

Look when tech company values started to divorce from reality...it was right after the 3rd round of QE.

Bought the 50s for fun as they were $.04 a share. 25 contracts cost me $100. 

I hear exactly what you’re saying and I’m sure you’re right, but I will offer this in response to play devil’s advocate:

This is not a normal time for tech stocks. I know CSCO is not a growth name like FB and GOOG and UBER. BUT, they are a tech company that has products that should be in increased demand right now like VPN and security and WebEx and telepresence. 

This rally has been driven by large caps and they haven’t really participated to a large degree. They are the only large cap tech name reporting next week which will attract a lot of attention and theoretically, capital.

6,2020-05-09,"I'd probably sell both for whatever I could get in return at open on Monday morning. You went too far OTM on those for sure, what's your break-even price?

It's a pretty simple proposition really; $SPY opened the week at $280.46 and closed at $292.44 for +$11.98 (4.27%) on the week. In that time $MSFT climbed from $174.50 to $184.68 (+$10.18) and $FB from $199.87 to $212.35 (+$12.48). Even if the market continues at the same rate next week (optimistic) your calls will still be worthless.

8,2020-05-09,"Oddly enough, I'm now wondering if the Rona will lead to the final boom and bust of the tech stocks as we head towards re-opening the economy.  Here's my retarded thesis that is probably very flawed somehow:

Boom - Some tech companies have acquired new costumers due to the Rona.  Think forced hyper-migration into using them out of necessity.  E-commerce sites like Amazon and Etsy are getting black-friday levels of shopping traffic (or something like that) because retail stores are closed or scary to go to.  Traditional brick &amp; mortar small businesses are attempting to go e-commerce with Shopify.  Paypal reported record transactions on May 1.  All that chatty stuff is being used (Zoom, Snapchat, Facebook) because in-person contact is riskier.  Netflix and Activision Blizzard are there for home entertainment.  And I'm too retarded to understand how cloud businesses like Microsoft, Twilio, Okta, and ServiceNow are benefiting from it, but I guess that's a thing too.

Bust - Here I think is the other side of the coin with all those companies I mentioned above.  Their entire bull run is predicated on growth growth growth (especially the ones that aren't profitable right now).  You see, the stay-at-homey economy has forced a handful of tech-averse holdouts to sign up for and use their services, essentially fast-forwarding their growth (the big boom).  Now with their growth fast-forwarded, they'll hit their total addressable market quicker, and there will be a flattening of their growth curve sooner as they have no new customers left to acquire.  See, COVID-19 forced the most old-fashioned get-off-my-lawn type of people to finally succumb to using their tech products and solutions - and those customers are the end of the line... the final hold-outs... the last remaining untapped market... there are no new customers left to acquire after them and nowhere left to grow bigly.  Added to that, when the economy re-opens, some of those old-fashioned customers may ditch the tech companies' services after essentially being ""forced"" to try them out and failing miserably with them (whether for business or personal use).

And with ""peak growth"" now hit (pussy-ass tiny growth doesn't count), Wall Street will realize that with not much growth left, they will actually have to value tech companies based on (GASP!) PROFITS now, and judge them as very over-valued on that basis.  And so they will turn on the tech stonks, the cloud stonks, and FAGMAN (FB, AMZN, GOOG, MSFT, AAPL, NFLX) since for them it's ""show good growth or GTFO"".  And since FAGMAN is a major market driver, it'll drag the market down with it.

TL;DR - Stonks only go up until FAGMAN and other cloud and tech hit a growth wall (which happens sooner rather than later due to Rona).  Then the music stops.  Also, I'm really fucking stupid, so don't listen to me.",VotedOut,wallstreetbets,8.0

Keep in mind at the time we had a 5,000 sqft warehouse for a different business that is semi seasonal. Well we would win units do our best to sort stuff to sell online vs. just random crap but every Saturday we would advertise as the largest garage sale. My friends mom happened to be in and she brought a turquoise bolo tie up to the table and was like you guys might want to look this up. So we did some searching and it was made out of silver and turquoise by some popular designer. We sold it on eBay for $600. If it wasn’t for friends mom someone would’ve asked the price and probably would’ve bought it for $5.

We did this for about 2 months before the building owners stopped us for insurance purposes and not being a retail space. We still buy storage units and just list stuff on FB market place.

Craziest thing we found was a loaded shot gun with the safety off inside a kids toy chest. Ran the numbers and it came back stolen so we contacted the police. They came by and looked at it and ran the numbers and turns out it was stolen from the ATF in a different county.

Then you worry you might have been wrong.

No worries, just buy stuff in the red and hope it goes green.

Then start worrying you were wrong.

Search through yahoo finance, they have a ton of great stuff. Also stocktwits on what salm10 and others have to say.

Also check the news for upcoming things and what insiders say.

Then start worrying that you were wrong.

1. Post a blog post on Reddit with buzzwords like ""provision"", ""technical"", ""processes"", etc. 
2. Say msft/amzn/aapl/fb will buy it out and it will be announced on a certain day this week.
3. Get in while you can!
4. End if with ""this is just my own DD, do your. Own Dunkin Donuts"" at the end so it doesn't look like Im fishing.

Then start worrying that might not work.

* Chart support and resistance.
* Check and note any patterns evident in recent days/weeks and note any future patterns that started or are close to fully developing.
* Note EMA, VWAP and any other things relevant on a chart
* Note important things like float, short float%, volume and RSI.
* Scan SEC for relevant info, note cash on hand, debt, Q and Y revenue, dilution, notes, etc
* Check for news, earnings, PR, online buzz
* Plan out your strategy for the trade according to whether its short, swing, long.

Now you know you were wrong. Try to understand why.

0,2020-05-13,"Apologies, I don't trade CFDs. If it were long shares, I could help. Markets are very unpredictable at the moment, if you can close your trade, I say close it right away. If you watch the prices move and try to time your trade, you're going to end up selling when fear is highest, as in when the price is closest to your stop order. Close all other positions and stay in cash. Go to yahoo finance and add an RSI indicator to SPY, set the number of periods to 14 and price type to close. Set the price interval to 1 week. If you followed these steps correctly, you will see RSI is currently 48. Check this chart at least once a day, if that RSI number ever falls below 30, buy SPY or check the price on some of the most popular stocks like FB, MSFT, AAPL, CRM, etc. and go long on the index or a few stocks if they're down at least 30% from Feb highs. Next, hold on to that investment, do not sell no matter what happens and eventually you will see 50%+ returns. DO NOT TRADE ON MARGIN! Because you can get a margin call and be forced to liquidate your positions if price drops further. Do not worry about prices going down--just hold until you have at least made your money back.

***8x8*** calls probably shit the bed, still got my fingers crossed on CYBR earnings beat for tomorrow AM (both were around $800 positions). Happy with their earnings beat tho

***CYBR*** riding through ER. Was up a little from this morning but went down hard at EOD. Holding, probably will liquidate tomorrow depending on ER (pre-market tomorrow)

***NET...*** I was able to make some fuckin money off today. Sold my NET baghold from earnings and actually made $500 toal on NET, up from -$6500 this morning. Got lucky and sold at the high.

***AAPL*** calls, I panic dumped them and saved a ton of money, only lost like $200 or so which was fucking clutch. Would have lost like $3k if I had held I think. Was up but glad I didn't lose much

***SDC***  caught the falling knife and opened calls at $.90 (EOD at $.75). Might double up tomorrow AM because they *should* run up to earnings

***TSLA***, I panic bought 20 shares at close today. Wanted options but pussied out. I think with Trumps tweet they will moon tomorrow but didn't want to gamble too much

***FB*** calls 6/19 EOD today. Hopefully not a fucking mistake. Will see in a few days.

***DDOG*** calls printed nicely!! 250% gain, sold at $69.69 for good luck

**Logi** shit the bed but I was able to recover most of my loss from the morning

***ZNGA*** calls into earnings finally went from .01 to .00 which was funny. Small position - not even worth my time to liquidate the position, just let it expire I guess

**Watchlist for tomorrow;**

TSLA, NVDA, Maybe try another AAPL/AMD scalp if it feels right

This is the driving factor about why future date is not specified. It is an estimation of how long the company will survive and its terminal value. So unless you can show how Facebook faces an existential crisis that will drop its terminal value. Its priced in.

This is why when a company seeks corporate bonds for liquidity reasons, the share price drops rapidly until it secures those bonds. The terminal value is in danger if it goes bankrupt.

I just want people to understand the quant models that are modelling pricing before they make a bet with short term logic. The way to think about FB is to model GDP forecasts for 2020 -&gt; 2025. Have you done this? because if you believe GDP is negative for 5 years, sir i have a bridge to sell you. This is why your puts are getting rekt.

I mean - the guy on bottom right cannot abstain from drifting too much into political opinion but he is one of four.  It was more the segment with so much time devoted to Kara Swisher providing no insight from an investing perspective - just vitriolic insulting of Zuckerberg and Trump because she obviously just doesn’t like them.  That’s totally fine - more power to you.  But you’re on an investment show (supposedly) amd you just want to insult Zuckerberg (he doesn’t know what 1st amendment is - he’s naive - wrong side of history) and Sandberg (where is she was wah).  

She wants to be self righteous and speak about them with such utter contempt for what - not censoring or monitoring potential false information or statements she doesn’t like - she worked for The NY Times for Christ sake - how many fuck ups do they have.  I don’t particularly li,e Zuckerberg but I wouldn’t go into that if the context was something called fast fucking money.  These fake and phony SJW just love a little spotlight to spew shit when given the chance - but I guarantee they close their eyes or turn their head in general as most companies have a ton of shit behind the scenes that you wouldn’t like and you actually probably know it - but hey - you’re not going to get on and talk about Nike because they’re so good at their social media message of positivity.

-80% to +40% lifetime swapping from mostly bear to mostly bull recently.

[https://imgur.com/a/Q3xvUK7](https://imgur.com/a/Q3xvUK7)

I joined both WSB and Robinhood a little over 3 months ago during the  whole SPCE TO THE MOON!!! period and made some modest gains (that teeny  tiny bump at the start) and proceeded to baghold too long and sell for a  loss. Then after a series of bad plays (again, holding too long) and  mistimed puts,  I started pouring more and more money in to try to  recoup the losses but kept losing. What started as a deposit of my \~$600  tax return to play around with became a $13k nightmare.

Anyway,  eventually I went full bull at the bottom, and was able to recover it  all much quicker than I lost it. At peak, I was down -80% all time and  from yesterday to today alone, I went from -38% to +40%. I'll be cashing  out my initial investment + a bit extra so it's all play money from  here.

Positions that won big:

RTX, SPY, FB, ACB, DKNG, NAT **calls**

Positions that lost big:

USO, NAT, AL, CHGG **calls**

SNAP, AAPL, GILD, CHGG, CRM, SPY **puts**

\- Don't chase dips you aren't VERY confident about

\- Usually but not always inverse WSB

\- Don't bet against America",theChad802,wallstreetbets,12.0

I don't think the economy will suffer from COVID as a whole, but it will definitely change. I still want to travel, but on vacation, not for work. I'll keep my car but use it as I want, not every day, burning gas. And I know a lot of people that aren't working in the bottom 30% of the economy feel the same way.

All are looking a bit extended beyond the 4 day so I mainly trimmed and took any/all profits today. They may digest tomorrow. I do a bit of scrapping when I have the time... For example, at one point I had bought puts on AMZN today and watched it fall 20pts and sold for a profit by watching RSI, VWAP, and when QQQs showed back strength. I then switched over to calls and rode it back up. Ive stayed away from most ETFs and usually just use them as references to look at sector trends (SPY, QQQ, IWM, XLF, XLE, JETS). BETZ is a new ETF that I’m long in once Sports gets back online. It can also use it as a reference for GAN and DKNG. 

For options remaining, I only have GLD and SLV...  I bought them two days ago expecting Powell to cause it to spike once he talks about zero-interest rates. Commodities are tricky so sold 80% at EOD.

12,2020-06-11,"My thoughts on it: They did price in that risk, and then greedy Boomers, millennials / gen Zers with stimulus checks threw it at the market, greedy MMs continued to prop it up, unlimited QE and nightly PPP forced upward movements overnight where 99% of the market does not participate in the action. We've collectively deluded ourselves into believing things are going for a V or swoosh recovery because prices were effectively forced upward. I mean christ futures ended green 10 sessions in a row. Bankrupt companies are doubling daily, Pennystocks are going up 100% in a day, bad earnings are bought to the moon, unemployment is bullish, riots are bullish, nothing can stop ""Stocks Only Go Up"".

It's like putting your best hoe out there every day and shootin her full of coke so she can keep going. But after 2 weeks without eating or sleeping, her fuckin' teeth are falling out and skin is sagging. Gotta let her fuckin' rest. Markets don't go straight up, this shit is full of baloney and has been for at least a month, IMO longer. There is no logical reason companies should be trading at 6000 to 10000 P/E, or really for any of this shit. Red markets right now are a shot of reality before stimulus, FOMO, and market manipulation can come in and prop that shit up.

COVID is just the straw that broke the bitch's back, we were waaaay overbought and overpriced before any of this shit happened. Yield curve inverted months before COVID was even a thing. All bull runs come to an end eventually, and putting strings on this shit like its Weekend at Bernie's does nothing but shield our eyes from the fact that these are zombie companies that have no business being as valuable as they are. Tech is also part of the problem, but at least there is some logical reason if you're looking 30 years in the future for why AMZN, AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, FB, etc. are trading where they are.

23,2020-06-11,"Well, if you think there'll be a REAL crash, like multiple days, etc., then hold onto the August expiry puts.  If you're happy with a 5% sell-off and your gains, then sell.

The closer to expiration you buy out of the money options, the more juice (higher delta) you'll get from moves in the underlying.  But you also have to worry about a move against you which could completely wipe you out.

I would do some more research before investing more into options.  Make sure you are using limit orders unless you're only playing monthly SPY options.  Bid-ask spread will eat you alive on the less liquid stuff.

Short-dated options are truly gambling.  But if it is gambling or day-trading that you want, those are your best bet.  If you are investing or making a longer-term bet on the market, then buy options out at least a month or two.

Make sure you check open interest to make sure there is enough liquidity in the option you want to trade.  If you stick to large caps like FB, DIS and SPY, you should be ok on liquidity.

I gonna miss every single one of you 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

I sold my 100 FB shares bought by 2x margin, and have bought mainly bought reopening stocks, diversified as follows -

Total Market Value approx 12k

Tech - FB * 5, MSFT * 5 = 2k

Airlines - BA * 5, RTX * 9, UAL * 15, JETS * 47 = 3k

Oil - Exxon * 23, Chevron * 11 = 2k

ETF - DIA * 5, SPY * 2, KBE * 13 = 2k

Housing - FNF * 33 = 1k

Hotel - MARR *  11, HLT * 13 = 2k

All these stocks have a straight growing graph for past 5 years,
No margin so no need to be scared of margin calls, I will keep investing small amounts every month as I get paid.

Again gonna miss all of you BYE , Stay Safe

Most companies raging spend only a few million on FB ads. Their biggest customer for ads is surprisingly Home Depot, who spends 170 million and they haven't pulled anything. Vast majority of companies spend sub 10 million.

All companies pausing or proposing a pause are doing so for 30 days only. 

Many companies are jumping on the bandwagon simply because stating their intentions to stop advertising *is* an advertisement and it saves money. What for-profit company wouldn't say this shit? Who is going to actually give a fuck if they don't stop, though? 

All companies are doing this in a dumbfuck knee jerk response because people need a scapegoat and a single, identifiable target because racism is a complex and deep-seated issue that is far too broad in scope to address in an ad. 

Shops is estimated to earn them 30 **b**illion.

1.) don’t buy options with less than 1 mth expiry date.  Don’t hold options beyond one month expiry date or you will lose $10-30 Everyday including weekends.  That’s a lot.

2.) the advantage of buying OTM is that you need lesser capital, and even if the price of the stock moves against you, you won’t lose a lot of money.  However if the price of the stock goes up you won’t reap much tendies.

The advantage of buying ATM is that if the stock price moves i will make significantly more from my calls.

if for example FB drops today but I am not sure if it will drop further tmr but I am sure it will go up in a week then I would buy OTM calls.  So if it drops the next day I will just buy in even more.  This is because FB always goes up.

If for example I am pretty confident that the stock price is not going to drop any further but instead going to go up soon then buy ATM to reap max tendies.

3.) buy at Low IV sell at high IV.  IV increases the price of options because people expect the price to move strongly either direction soon.

For example, the day before earnings IV will always be high.  So play the run up or sell options on that day, but the worst thing you can do is buy options.",joeltan15,wallstreetbets,389.0

PFE currently has the most promising covid treatment in their pipeline, yet is still trading 10% below their MAY share price.

The more active trading you do, the more likely you are to end up on the wrong side of examples like the above.",somanychins,wallstreetbets,10.0

Building the brand through social media. Especially with cosmetics, the cult following is strong. Influencer marketing, giving more than you take on customer service... ie; lost shipment? Refunded instantly (even though sometimes customers defraud you), damaged products (refund instantly).

The organic advertising from customers who received outstanding customer service can't be tracked BUT it works over time.

 Zuckerberg made the biggest mistake of his life by not changing the add policy and to top it off he said not only he doesn't care, but that the companies on the boycott list are coming back to the platform and they are just joining for publicity and nothing else. He basically just told Microsft and Starbucks that they are a bunch of fakes and he will prove it to the world when they come back and advertise on FB. Not many things I can guarantee you in life but I guarantee you that those big companies will not advertise on FB ever again unless he changes the add policy now that he said what he said.

If you think the stock is going to consistently gain, then the positive theta (you gain money as time goes on) and minimal required movement will be optimal for ATM/slightly OTM debits. I did a backtest and found it's 80-90% success rate for information technology stocks with an 80-100% return rate during a bull market/bull run. The risk/reward is amazing.

""Only beginners look at these charts""

No, they don't. They're usually very accurate, and only inaccurate because they don't consider all of the advanced greeks: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks_(finance). and, for the most part, volatility. You gain less because volatility goes down when the stock price goes up, devaluing your call slightly as the price rises. If anything, the chart is vouching for you by failing to calculate a decrease in volatility.

In terms of intrinsic value, these charts help. In terms of extrinsic value (volatility, second-level and third-level greeks, relation to bonds and the yield curve, market open and market close) there is no such calculation being performed. But I doubt most people care about that or even calculate it anyway.

In my experience this chart has been incredibly accurate anyway. It helps you calculate your exit point precisely.

If you're profiting off of the consistent gains of a reliable company like MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, DIS, FB, etc. then debit spreads are absolutely optimal. If you think FB is going to spike ~8% after an artifical drop, then FB calls are justified.",lnvisibleGhost,wallstreetbets,38.0

I'd you have a dissenting opinion you get ""filtered"" now on FB and Twitter. It's kinda insane. I'm sure there are many more ""pro-biden"" that will be voting Trump than your scenario.

 Back to the markets. Many people (read company execs) that I have heard interviews of and/or talked to personally have seen the benefits from remote work (lower costs, deadlines still getting filled, less buerocracy, more flexibility, etc.) I don't think the tech crash you are expecting will be nearly as hard as you seem to think even if it does come. There's plenty of services that people have had to pick up during corona that will stay with them after, whether corporate or private. Tech had a big boost forward from corona that has sped up a change that was going to happen regardless, just on a longer time frame than currently. Are these companies retardedly inflated right now? Hard yes. But is it possible this becomes the new norm? Potential yes.",yura37,wallstreetbets,58.0

Jul. 2, 2020 4:35 PMFacebook, Inc. (FB)By: Jason Aycock, SA News Editor
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg will meet on Tuesday with three groups behind a growing advertiser boycott of the social-media company.

The execs will meet Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt; Color of Change President Rashad Robinson; and NAACP CEO Derrick Johnson, Bloomberg reports.

The company had reached out to the groups earlier this week, and the civil rights groups had said they wanted Zuckerberg in attendance.

Everyone expected a big drop off in FB ad revenue however it will still be true and FB is highly overvalued. Ad revenue will only continue to fall, as advertising budgets are the first to be slashed in an economic downturn. Pair this with the cost of advertising dropping, due to the same economic downturn (people seeing ads aren't going to spend as much, so each ad is going to have a significantly decreased return= ads should reduce in price) so you have a multiplying effect on the decreasing value of ads, which FB is dependent on for their business.  


But DH, what about this COVID stay at home shit! People are going to just be on FB and SNAP and phones more than other ad serving platforms like TV!  


You don't have to be out of work to be under a spending squeeze. Just the threat of people's jobs on the line, plus the forecasted economic apocalypse has stunted consumer spending, as most consumers recall 2008. It doesn't matter where an ad is if it has no effect.  


On top of this, investors are pumping Tech during this bubble with a false notion that it is worth investing in. While true that some companies' products will be in demand, FB doesn't sell the consumer something while they use it. They rely on the consumer spending being high in order to turn revenue. The election year spend has already been modeled into their forecasts, and the skewed polls actually mean PACs are going to spend less overall, as many consider it a waste of money by end of Summer to focus on the Presidential election.

2) Biden said explicitly that non-working millionaires are going to get a bigger tax bill. I don’t think this is an empty campaign promise. I do not expect, however, that the US tax system would be simplified in any measurable degree. 

3) healthcare. hospitals and pharmaceuticals are not going to make as much money. Plain and simple. There may be some radical changes to healthcare but I don’t expect full-blown nationalization of the system. 

4) tech. I do not expect Amazon, FB, or twitter to become regulated like utilities in the next 4 years but at the the same time, I wouldn’t be altogether surprised - especially if Warren is appointed to a cabinet position. Tech might be in for a nasty surprise there. 

5) I do expect the trade spat with China to continue even in the event of a dem-controlled gov’t. The IP issue is something that everyone wants resolved and and there would be some major political points to score over GOP if dems can make measurable progress there. 

6) workers rights. I mention it only because I expect there will be significant changes in this area of legislation but the ramifications on tendies aren’t clear to me.

Oil price is down, therefore CPI is down (not true, but a simple comparison)  When you put S&amp;P over CPI you get an entirely different result, analygous to putting the Nasdaq over the S&amp;P and wondering why FB is doing so well despite the magic graph.

In retard terms:  Big Denominator make smaller numerator.  Big Oil make big CPI make big denominator, make smaller numerator.  Everything you think is retarded but inverse of what you think is closer to the true true.  Big Oil is Big Denominator, is (not really but sort of) big CPI (denominator,) is smaller S&amp;P (Numerator.)  So essentially, when you look at the graph you need to recognize that the CPI is below the fair value of the S&amp;P, and more importantly has no real relation to the S&amp;P, so IDK why this retarded OP decided to compare them.

Edit: SP500/CPI(today)*CPI(pre-Covid) is retarded and that's what I was responding to.  The rest of what you said (disregarding this weird random calculation) seems to be right... essentially OP is wrong and if you can understand why CPI and S&amp;P are not fully comparable you might survive.

FB is a tough one as well.  I don't think that the boycott represents conviction from these companies.  All those companies were already reducing AD spend but now they can claim social credit for it.  In a melt up market, FB does OK but I do not see it outperforming as companies reduce AD spend. Same applies for GOOG but GOOG is selling tons of cloud deals.

I don't have a view on any airlines.  LUV is the best from all the others but the environment looks to be tough for a couple years.  Airlines are loading up on debt so they might take time before they consolidate and move up. I have never invested in airlines so hard for me to form a constructive view.

282,2020-07-06,"##It May Be A Long Wait For The Next $1 Trillion Dollar Company

&gt;Alphabet closed the week with a market value just above $1 trillion, making it the fourth member of the trillion-dollar club, along with Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon.com.

&gt;The group is likely to remain exclusive for a while. There's no obvious fifth candidate. Among U.S. companies, Facebook (ticker: FB) is next in line, but the social giant has a long way to go to reach trillion-dollar status. Its market value is $665 billion. The social network is currently under fire for how it polices content, but it has a mammoth global user base -- 3 billion people use Facebook, Instagram, or WhatsApp on a monthly basis -- that no other company can match.

&gt;After Facebook, though, there's no other U.S. company with a market value between $500 billion and $1 trillion. (There are two foreign stocks in that range. Alibaba (BABA) and Tencent (0700.Hong Kong) are both valued around $600 billion.)

&gt;There are two companies in the $400 billion range -- Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) and Visa (V) -- and three with a 3-handle -- Mastercard (MA), Walmart (WMT), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ).

&gt;There are 13 U.S. companies with valuations between $200 billion and $300 billion -- Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), UnitedHealth (UNH), Home Depot (HD), Intel (INTC), Nvidia (NVDA), Verizon Communications (VZ), Netflix (NFLX), AT&amp;T (T), Adobe (ADBE), PayPal (PYPL), Tesla (TSLA) and Walt Disney (DIS).

&gt;So which company is most likely to reach $1 trillion next? There's no easy answer. Most of the companies above $200 billion in market value are mature slower-growing businesses. They seem unlikely to double, triple or quadruple in size.

&gt;Here's how Barron's would handicap the race for the next trillion-dollar stock:

&gt;Tesla (TSLA): Already the most valuable car maker, Elon Musk's company has fundamentally changed what had been a slow-moving industry. To get to $1 trillion, Tesla's market cap would need to quintuple. To bet on Tesla to get there, you have to believe that Musk can substantially grow volumes, and maybe move into some large adjacent businesses, perhaps autonomous car hailing or robotic package delivery.

&gt;Walt Disney (DIS): Disney currently has plenty of issues. Theme parks? Closed. Sports? Shutdown. Movie production? Suspended. Traditional TV? On the wane. And yet, this is a company that has vast intellectual property assets and a knack for juicing them for decades. People are still watching Snow White, which debuted in 1938. At some point themes parks will open, sports will resume, and we'll head back to the movies. Some day, when Covid 19 is history, Disney could move to the front of the trillion-dollar race.

&gt;Disney/Netflix: One way Disney could get bigger in a hurry would be to team up with Netflix, adding the world's largest subscription-based video service to the Disney family. Simply combining the two companies would mean a market value over $400 billion.

&gt;Amazon Web Services/YouTube/Instagram: It's not impossible that the next trillion-dollar company could be buried inside an existing trillion-dollar company. If there's a complete regime change in Washington this fall, with Democrats taking not just the White House but also both houses of Congress, pressure to break up megacap tech companies could increase and spur structural change. The most obvious candidates for spinoffs are Amazon Web Services, the largest provider of cloud computing services; Alphabet's YouTube, by far the dominant player in ad-supported online video content; and Instagram, Facebook's hipper little sibling.

&gt;JPMorgan Chase: The country's largest bank has a prominent CEO in Jamie Dimon and a history of innovation. Could a financial services company reach $1 trillion? It's possible, though it might require a little sprinkling of M&amp;A magic to make it happen. The other obvious candidates from the financial services realm are Mastercard and Visa.

&gt;Wild Card: Could a pharma company soar to trillion-dollar status with a cure for Covid-19 or cancer or aging? Maybe. Could we see a shift in energy markets that drive oil companies back into the mix? Doubtful, but not impossible. Could another social networking player get there? Potentially, but it feels like a long shot. The venture backed company with the highest current valuation is China-base ByteDance, parent of the social media phenom TikTok. But it's not clear TikTok can ever reach Facebook's scale -- others have tried. Snap is worth just $34 billion, and Twitter, $24 billion.

&gt;Long shot pick: How about SpaceX? Elon Musk's other startup is already doing things in space travel that no private company has ever done. Musk's long- established goal is to get people to Mars. Or what if Tesla, which previously bought Solar City, decides to buy SpaceX, creating a transportation giant that can take you to the grocery store -- or to the end of the universe.",BlakeRidley,wallstreetbets,282.0

30,2020-07-08,"It may seem counter intuitive, but breaking ATH is bullish. It's a lot better to ride a stock ready to break out then it is catching a falling knife when a stock is reaching its 52 week low.

My portfolio is diversified in many different types of tech sectors, but my biggest holdings are:

DOCU 8/21 210C, SQ 8/21 140C, and ZM 8/21 300c, and  eBay 7/31 55c

I'll day trade these because they are very volatile and I like scalping them for 2x sometimes 3x gains during intraday dips:

FSLY 7/31 100c, PYPL 7/31 200c.

Also anytime you see FB or MSFT on a dip, you better fucking buy. Remember, don't FOMO into these. They fucking moon and they also have violent pull backs. On think or swim you can view the price history of a specific strike/expiry so study that and find a good entry point. DON'T EVER FOMO or you will lose money.

1,2020-07-09,"I lost $140k in two days just a couple weeks ago when the market shit itself below SPY 300. It was really really hard. Do your best to be objective about the situation and understand what is the right thing to do right now. In that case, I held on to the positions I believed in and bought more of the positions I thought were unfairly battered, and I have since recovered.

I really try my best to evaluate my portfolio every day and ask myself if I would buy the positions I’m holding. If the answer is no, they should be sold, you have to ditch the sunk cost fallacy. It makes it easier to figure out when a losing position should be dropped.

The style of investing here is also very luck oriented, so don’t beat yourself up for being unlucky. AMZN completely shit itself after the last earnings. It’s gone up like 50% since then. People who went long options for AMZN through earnings lost a ton of money! That’s just unlucky. If you held FB last month you got rich. If you held TWTR you got poor. If you held TWTR this month you got rich. They’re in the same fucking industry.

I definitely wouldn’t go stupid long trying to chase losses right now. Personally, I’m in only shares and those are all with sold covered calls to de-risk as much as possible aside from a select few 2022 LEAPs. And I’m staying there until July earnings play out, maybe even selling off the few remaining LEAPs.

Then it buys rapidly on the way up. So now there is a swing. it is doing this for thousand of stocks and billions in value. Then there is rapid increase in price, way up. Then the algo sells off tons of stock slowly bringing it down to the target at the higher price. Billions in stocks from a market maker just got dumped preparing to start buying them again when it hits 300.

It's the same fucking pattern every time. The get 5 - 15 billion dollar repo interest free loans as the SPY approaches 300 to set up again.

69,2020-07-09,"Facebook is harmful for its users the way Philip Morris products are harmful for its users.  I see it going more the MO path than the MySpace one, but yes, I think due to a combination of regulation, user fatigue, advertiser skittishness and general increase in harm awareness it will eventually become a dead dinosaur.  For instance there are now Apple Watch apps that can detect you reaching for and lighting up a cig, and nag you about it.  There is already a generic iPhone app that will nag you about screen time.  I really do not think it will be long until all smartphones are always actively advocating for the benefit of the people who hold them in their pockets, and in that case, these phones will be telling their users not to use Facebook.

MySpace wasn’t atrocious, it just went to zero.  MO as a stock isn’t atrocious if you ignore the harm it produces - I watched my own father drown in blood, awake, as lung cancer took him , but let’s ignore that for a moment - but MO is a company whose revenues shrink every year, and they have to devote precious FCF to dividends and share buybacks to keep total shareholder return constant.

This is bored retail FOMO.... with institutions and algorithms literally forced to eat this shit sandwich and participate.  If you look at trading volumes they are historically low - meaning there is less liquidity and more opportunity for things to run away.  

We saw some flashes this week in TSLA.  That shit went down like 5% in about 30 minutes... some TSLA call holders saw their lives flash before their eyes.

5,2020-07-11,"I haven't picked specific positions yet, but basically calls on half the expected move up by just before earnings with strike dates just after earnings (with the intend to close before earnings). I just need to determine about how far I think they'll move up by their earnings.

Here's what I see are different tiers:

Tier 1:

PTON - Gyms are getting fucked left and right and PTON is building a community of avid paying subscribers, plus just recently talked about reduced price treadmills and such, so they clearly understand the key is to now expand their base. Could be a huge disruptor in the space. And investors don't seem to think LULU's acquisition of Mirror will matter to this as it bounced back after the initial dip after that.

TWLO - I wish I had realized they owned SendGrid before their last ER or I'd have possibly gotten on that. Between Twilio and SendGrid, they're pretty well positioned in the cloud space.

NET - IMO one of the more heard-of cloud companies in recent years. Not sure if they're that sound financially, but so many people use them that I feel like they'll keep going up. Also how do you not invest in a company with ticker NET for fuck's sake?

FB - Tiktok r fuk, and Insta is implementing TikTok-like features to capitalize on it, which I just found out today. It also seems like they shook off the boycott pretty easily, which doesn't surprise me as someone running ads on there for some clients. Shit's getting expensive on there but I don't really have a choice, so I imagine many others are in the same boat.

SQ - SHOP is getting all the glory, but if SQ's online stores gets any sort of traction, they'll be mini-SHOP + merchant account + CashApp and whatever else they dip their toes into. They're being run like a company that wants to be the next mega-tech company.

CHGG (which your post reminded me of) - The shift of school to at-home makes this a no-brainer, and interesting to see them expand to other areas.

Tier 2:

UPWK - Clearly they've been benefiting from the pandemic and should continue being a strong play. My only concern is that I find it more of a platform for outsourcing overseas than locally, so I'm not sure people have had success there.

FVRR - Ditto.

SNAP - Also benefiting from TikTok being dickslapped, but I think they're more in danger of being overvalued. FB is at least profitable and has a high upside anyways.

SPOT - Seems to be becoming the destination for podcasts in addition to radio.

ZM - Has run up so much already, but is a household name and like CHGG, is a school at home play, and is becoming a staple to use within many different industries. But it's so damn high already.

Tier 3:

PINS - Don't know what to make of Pinterest long term, but social's pretty strong right now other than TWTR.

DDOG - May belong in a higher tier, I just don't know enough about them other than it's had strong movement being on the cloud train.

RNG - TWLO-lite. Heard something about them being in online video which could put them as a ZM competitor, but skeptical of their recent movement showing they're not really a strong play now. May have higher upside though given that so who knows.

DKNG - One of the only tech-ish stocks that's also a recovery stock at this point, and feels like a good time to play them as there are lots of possibilities of good news propelling it up.

WMT - This may sound silly, but if their + will be looking to snipe subscribers for at least shipping but likely other things down the road from AMZN, this could be their ticket back into the upper echelons, and they've not gone up THAT much from it. This could be like going back in time and playing NFLX was when they just introduced streaming, and no, obviously they're not YET dabbling into that, but in general them getting subscribers for anything could have them pivot into whatever they want. It's only in tier 3 because it's still a retail stock at a time when most retail is getting hammered. Less upside than pure tech.",SunriseSurprise,wallstreetbets,5.0

When we were all older and graduating high school, and he was giving us a lesson on financial advice, he said the way he would pick what moves he was about to make was by hanging out with us like once a month and just listening to what we talk about or what the new thing we are into is. Whatever it was, he would dump money into it and it pretty much always netted him huge returns. If I remember correctly he got into AAPL in the early 2000s, NFLX at IPO, TSLA at IPO, SNAP at IPO, and FB for under $50.

However, most e-commerce websites don't provide nearly enough information to help consumers visualize the products, so Pinterest has become one of the go to destination to see how products fit together and browse for shopping ideas. 

This is literally a marketer's dream because users are basically begging you to show them ads disguised as content in order to inspire them to shop. A real life analogy would be an IKEA catalogue, which is really just a collection of ads but is designed to feel like a magazine in order to maximize engagement.

Because our economies are so closely linked that separating it is catastrophic. It’s also very anti capitalistic, and against everything Adam Smith’s way of thinking. What deglobalization proposes is that we should seek less efficient ways of production, that’s like saying we should abolish factory lines and go back to have one person make an entire table from cutting down the wood in a forest to polishing the wood, to carpentry. Simply won’t happen, global trade was the product of decades of trial and error, and has evolved so much. We can’t dismantle it even if we tried, too much private  and public interest.

45,2020-08-01,"Yes I agree with some of your points as well. The speculative growth of these companies are what’s driving their stock prices. So in theory if growth becomes stagnate, then their prices will fall or even crash. Look at Google’s earnings, they didn’t grow as much as expected and their stock fell. But the reason I say this time is different, is because we are past the point of no return. These companies have reached a size that no competition can ever topple their reign. You don’t think FB had something to do with the whole banning TikTok narrative? They definitely spent a lot of money lobbying politicians and spreaded rumours about data security. EVEN THOUGH FB is the single worse offender in history when it comes to privacy violation. There are literally concrete example backed by evidence that they misused their data. The only real evidence of TikTok is some retard on Reddit, which he provided no backup to any of his claims. That Reddit comment has since been quoted by news media as a credible source. Anyways, my point is FB has a lot of influence over our lives and our laws and policies. MySpace never had that. Google has no real competition in the US, because their moat is data. Amazon has access to the single largest and most cash rich consumers in the entire world, and they have allllllll the data points you can imagine on all of us. Other retailers can not compete. Think of it like a virus, once it breaks out, there is no stopping. So while we could technically go back to pre Amazon, we won’t, simply because Amazon won’t let us. The real moat of Amazon and FB isn’t just the idea of selling shit online or connecting retards with each other, it’s the fact that they have an monopoly on our habits.

46,2020-08-01,"On one hand I have to agree with you but on the other hand you're giving way too much credit to all of those things we currently use.

Yes, times have changed. But life existed before Facebook and it will exist after that. How did we communicate before social media existed? Well, phone calls and text messages. Nokia and Blackberry dominated the mobile phone market before smartphones emerged. If you told someone in 2003 that Nokia will become irrelevant in the mobile phone market they'd tell you that you're crazy. The entirety of Europe was all over Nokia.
And Nokia had the user base, the cash, the IP, influence, research, infrastructure...that's why they're still alive even after they got completely annihilated in the mobile phone market.

Amazon just makes it easy to receive everything you need but again, life existed before Amazon. Other players died out or adapted to the new situation. Here in Germany we still have other big retailers and while they're struggling they still exist. If Amazon for some mysterious reasons disappears tonight then I guess I need to use those other retailers more.

What I'm concerned about is the insane growth priced into those tech companies. Well, especially Amazon, Apple, Netflix and FB. Google seems to be lagging behind.

It is a bubble if the market is focussed on few mega corps no matter how good they look.

I don't think we will go back to dumb phones or whatever we used in 2005.  over the course of time the competitors will find a niche and overthrow the current kings to some extent. That's what happened with Nokia, BlackBerry and whoever got smashed by the rise of Apple.

78,2020-08-02,"wow thanks for the great input seriously

personally do not know much about the FB earnings and ad revenue stuff

but Visa did beat earnings but their overall eps and revenue is down quarter to quarter and year on year

furthermore might i add that visa is more or less used in most of the transactions online (afaik i am not living in the US) and Visa basically handles transaction for almost every size of company from big to small (and would hence signal that overall transactions are down) (larger businesses will have larger amount of transaction volume as well, shadowing the small business's demise)

while square has a way larger small business exposure

but your 150c might work out as many investors are really only focusing on the cashapp and its growth which i personally do feel kinda bullish on

Why? Because of omnicom/publicis earnings.

Omnicom and Publicis have reported massive reduction in ad revenue, also big players started boycotting Fb because of the whole hate speech thing.

Yet Fb smashed earnings? The only sense i can make of that is either cooked books or a massive uptick in the ""long tail"" of advertisers (mostly small business)

To me this signals small business is alive and well, but selling online.

Also Visa reported earnings beating expectations, meaning transactions overall ain't that bad.

59,2020-08-07,"So much hate.  No reason to have a chip on your shoulder. Let your returns speak for themselves. I decided to actively start managing my investments end of May. Prior to that I had all of my investments in a low cost S&amp;P 500 Index at Vanguard which is one of my three benchmarks plus Dow and Nasdaq. I am up about 27.5% in 9 weeks. 

 I am constantly refining my strategy and actively researching companies and current news.  It is all about the time investment. I had a good foundation of understanding financials from my day job and Undergrad/MBA. If you are unwilling to invest the time then Index Funds are a good alternative. No one is getting rich on the passive Index funds. The other big issue is risk.  How much are you willing to take for the rate of return you will get? Goal is max return with minimal risk. Many people don't have the discipline to invest/trade without it getting out of control.  Rational decision making is critical.

I am invested in AAPL, MSFT, FB, CRSP, AMZN, ADBE, NVDA, AMD as more long term bets.  I also have invested in TSLA, CWH, SONO, ROKU, PTON, NFLX etc. You have reevaluate your positions and periodically sell investments.  I have sold too early and stayed in too long multiple times.

That’s why Reels is integrated with Instagram. Which in my opinion is incredibly stupid in the long run because it dilutes both products. But FB knows otherwise it would have flunked immediately. Now they can say Instagram users are reels users as well. Even though reels feels incredibly rushed just to capitalize on Tiktok uncertainty which is gone now that Trump is actually going to force the sale essentially.

TL;DR: FB chasing trends is bad long term for the company and the stock, and MSFT is going to have a cash cow on their hands with TikTok.",96reltihleih,wallstreetbets,97.0

It’s also in the Instagram app. So they’re not stealing any marketshare from the millions and millions of users addicted to Tiktok. And it’s also diluted Instagram by convoluting it.

Kids now a days think FB is lame and Instagram is not as popular with the main age group that loves Tiktok.

I think max gains on the 0days on the way up was maybe 1300-1500% and then probably on the way down another 1300-1500%. Despite the massive day yesterday, the premiums on the FB options were still pretty low!",SunriseSurprise,wallstreetbets,6.0

1. Keep track of 1-3 tickers that have high volume and are liquid af. I'm in tech and this past week the main stocks I traded are Microsoft, Docusign, and Zooom
2. Know your support levels. This is crucial for getting a good entry so you're not the dumbass buying at the top. For me, Msft is 200, Docu is 200, Zoom is 250. Resistance eventually becomes support, so be flexible.
3. Once the stock hits support level, scale into your positions. Don't be a retard and go all in immediately. Buy 2, then 4, etc etc. Get 10-20% OTM calls expiring in 4-6 weeks. If you're looking for a lotto ticket, get one that expires in 2-3 weeks.

Fastly is down because there is anticipation they will lose business from Tiktok.

Microsoft is up because there is anticipation they will buy Tiktok.

Facebook is up because they are releasing an app/feature with capabilities similar to Tiktok.


If Microsoft buys tiktok, I doubt they would immediately transition away from Fastly.  So these two moving in opposite directions is odd. Don't companies usually drop in price when they buy expensive hot garbage?

If microsoft is anticipated to buy Tiktok, who gives a shit about a Facebook competitor? Is the user base expected to remain with tiktok and also use Facebooks platform for the same thing?

For your first example, I disagree with the analogy. The Chinese athlete would be competing on steroids in the US, which is still illegal. What has tik tok done that is outright illegal? To use your analogy, tik tok would have to be caught on steroids. I think I'm pretty up to date on the story, and I haven't seen any criminal behavior. If there is that would be news to me.

&amp;#x200B;

And if you're familiar with Cambridge analytica and what they've done, the information FB has of all its users was more or less piped straight to the Russian government. Go ahead and ban tik tok, China will just buy the info from FB or just hack them or go to another data harvesting company. All mass surveillance is the true problem. Why don't we pass laws so nobody can indiscriminately collect vast amounts of data without our knowledge? Then tik tok can still compete in our market and everyone is actually happy? This solution is nonsense, barely a bandaid. That's my only point. It's not the easiest or best solution, and it is certainly not the solution that embodies free-market capitalism.

146,2020-08-07,"Sorry noob question:

But when you’re out of pattern day trades and you want to lock in profits for a call position for example I’ve read that you can just sell a call contact with a strike price one above your original position. And so for example if I have 4 $285c FB 8/21 contracts and I want to lock in profits I would sell 4 $290c FB 8/21 because that’s the contract with the strike price above the $285s.

And so if I do this is there a worst case scenario where I lose even more money? Or would I just stop making profits on my $285 because any further gains would be offset by the $290s that I sold and vice versa?

I wouldn’t be surprised if Tik Tok MSFT acquisition falls through. There’s a lot of suggestive content on Tik Tok sometimes referring to users promoting their OnlyFans and what not, MSFT could see that as a liability.

66,2020-08-08,"Hmmm. Fb made an attempt Back In 2018 or So And started its own app to compete against Tik Tok called Lasso. July 2nd 2020 Fb terminates Lasso And removed it from all app stores.

Antitrust laws attempt to stifle out actions that result In making competition impossible. Unless those actions further develop your product or is beneficial to the consumer.

Msft acquisition of tik tok was the biggest rumor because they have the capital to take over, and they don’t have any foothold in social media platforms. They’ve also been laying pretty low and weren’t invited to the antitrust hearing two weeks ago. Fb acquisition of Tik Tok could argue that a take over should be allowed to further develop their “Lasso” product. Furthermore the user data from Tik Tok can be integrated into Fb and Instagram to improve usability for the consumer. It’s a weird coincidence that Fb decided early July to shut down Lasso In July And not any time In between Tik Tok vans began to Surface. I think that shutting down Lasso And removing the application early July was done with the intent  to demonstrate that they were incompetent in video formatted social Media And that their product needed further development. This could then be argued that Fb acquisition of Tik Tok would not be to stifle out competition but to improve their failed project Lasso. Any thoughts?

I dont think it can happen unless real estate shits like 2008. but it wont, much better safeguards and timeline on that is like a year ahead for it to happen.

all the businesses that are still working all around the world - ok so they lose sales. are they gonna close when they have billions in cash and property? no.

i mean the market can go down, but it wont go down 20% - the world is as it is, the stock market is a GLOBAL thing - and worldwide everything is pretty good.

114,2020-08-11,"TA works but it doesn’t predict the news. News drives the market. 

TA tells you what to do with that news. For example- Tiktok banned is news. A smart investor would know any TikTok competitor in the USA is gonna pop from this news. In this case- Facebook. 

TA tells you the average amount a stock can move based on historical data. Then you take that number and add it on top. So let’s say positive news historically over the last 30-60 days would move FB $10 up. 

Then you factor in volume. Last news catalyst that popped FB stock $10 had, let’s say, 500k volume. 

You see FB popping. You missed out on the first pop. You see the volume is 50% more than the last pop. So the ATR of $10 is probably x 1.5. So wait for it to go up maybe $15. Then buy puts. 

The VWAP and RSI confirms that once FB went from $262 to $278 (difference of $16) it was way oversold. You know ahead of time due to volume and ATR that $15 is the ceiling. You buy puts. 

It goes up to $16, then dips down $12 from that point. 

Your put was cheap. Let’s say $.65. Even just one contract. Delta was .4 or whatever. Boom you just made like $500. 

Now if you bought puts before the news? You just lost all your money. The news drives the car. The TA just tells you how much gas is in the tank.",iyioi,wallstreetbets,114.0

The way I see it, much better idea to ignore all that and go into APPL, AMZN, FB, MSFT and GOOG.

42,2020-09-01,"You're correct. However, that does not mean it will be such a big chunk of their revenue in the future. Advertising has traditionally only been a significant portion of revenue because it is one of the only monetizable things that Facebook has to offer. Once you introduce FB shops, they can take a small service fee for transactions, once this commerce occurs in a virtual world, virtual real estate may be a thing. If this exists with a novel currency, that gives the wealth available to the owners of an entire monetary system to FB.

These are all big IFs, but it's the direction I see things going. It's comparable to what Elon is doing with his companies. Boring is digging tunnels in major cities, TSLA is creating electric autonomous vehicles, and SpaceX is working on commercializing space travel. If you believe the tunnels dug by Boring won't afford some level of functionality to Tesla vehicles that they don't to other vehicles, then you're not thinking like an entrepeneur. If you think that the advancements made by Tesla and Space X exist independent of one another, you arent thinking like an entrepreneur. 

Everyone wishes they could go back in time to ride the Tesla wave, but that can't be done. What can be done is to look at the big picture, do the math, and predict where things are going to ride the next big wave. That's what I'm trying to point out.

51,2020-09-01,"tl;dr  I would not factor VR into short-term holding assessment of Facebook until they announce some sort of linkage between their VR platforms and advertising insights/market analysis. 

  


I've worked in VR industries in both games &amp; enterprise for 6 years, including getting and exiting investment from HTC.   


If anything, there's a good chance for parallel value between enterprise and entertainment - but entertainment is wholly reliant on the social aspect and none of these goofy 'VR will replace' plays are going to pay off. We were at the start of the VR investment craze and the amount of dumb shit people pitched, including me, at the time was spectacular. Many engineers simply do not want to admit that people do not want to do anything remotely more effort than pressing 1 button to make the thing go. FB is not doing anything in enterprise since their new terms of service, so it's only entertainment and social.  


Oculus is going towards social, not because VR, but because of data. FB is hiring tons of VR engineers, FB scouts are low-key funding a shit load of games content, only rivaled by Sony, but they're after one single thing: people data. Those headsets with inside-out tracking, microphones and 6-dof hand-tracking are harvesting a whole new field of data on people, their spaces and limited bio-metrics. When Google Tango was first going up in prototypes, they were also mapping the rooms/buildings of every single Tango device and it was certainly some Batman level ethical grey-area. All of this is a front for data, so they'll keep throwing shit at the wall until something sticks well enough to get that data.  


Basically do your DD in services FB offers, including their APIs, and maybe google x-ray stackoverflow to find their engineers talking with people on Oculus machine-vision, then there might be a good indicator of what they're doing with it.",echocdelta,wallstreetbets,51.0

10,2020-09-03,"Posted this earlier but expanded on it + positions:

Tech bubble was caused by dumb companies that made no money (Pets.com famously sold merchandise 27% below cost)

2008 was caused by the housing crisis (evictions are now illegal).

2001 crash was caused by 9/11.

What could pop this bubble? (If it's even a bubble). I’m holding my calls because it keeps going up no matter what. When we have a red day or negative news I tell myself: ""Stonks go up"" and either by EOD or the next day, it goes green without fail.

But at the same time I’m starting to get worried about a bubble- but what will trigger it? 
Money is practically free, poor people who are getting devastated by the virus with no stimulus never invested in the market anyways. If anything the average person with spare change can now throw their money into the market easier than ever before with RH.

I understand the subprime crisis was undetected, so what could possibly be undetected now? 
What will pop this? Am I missing something? Give me a reason not to hold my tech calls.
Sometimes I feel like the market will pop is because doubling my money in months doesn't sound right, this isn't supposed to happen. But maybe we're just smarter than the rest and making as much as we can while the printer is on (this doesn't sound right either).

In the dot com bubble we saw rise in lots of companies that had no business being listed on the NYSE in the first place. But none of those companies had the market cap of any major tech companies today (MSFT, APPL, GOOGL, FB). Sure everyone is rushing to these ticker symbols because of their quick rise as of recently, but these companies are not going anywhere anytime soon.

But effectively, yes.",Unlucky-Prize,wallstreetbets,1.0

$118k AMZN calls - Luckily bought most of them near the very bottom, expiration about a month out

$126k LULU calls - I bought mostly near the bottom and am planning on selling Tuesday on the hopeful run up to earnings.

$100k ZM calls - Cuz shits gotta go back up after the sell off hysteria is over, right?

$40k PTON calls - Bought mid day for a decent price, also selling day of earnings

$32k ZS calls - Hoping there will be a run up to earnings on 9/9 because they usually blow past earnings estimates, planning to sell before announcement

23,2020-09-04,"fb was undervalued before at a 38p/e. considering other social stocks trade in the 50s. and fb has more going for it then just social things to its peers like tesla has a edge up on its peers, being far more then just one thing.

its traded mid 20s p/e last year when they had no new business models running. whenever an acquisition is made (instagram, whats app, etc) they can trade in the 50s putting them like 350$ a share now. normally they still outdo on the earnings big time with or without acquisitions, like its purposefully estimated low. with reels and the shops feature which is going to be a far more profitable engine for them then just advertising while increasing amount of advertising to users. i would say trading up to 50 is reasonable. i expect a blowout earnings. they killed it even with losing most of their big advertisers in boycotts. many came back silently for this coming quarter. on top of growth and lower cost to operate its going to be a 30% surprise. even then that's only modest money here in q4. 

the next time it moons it will have to severely blow out earnings. enough to make it speculative to gain investors momentum. i personally call for 400$ share priced base loosely on fundamentals with some momentum if it can hit 350 by december. 

i can only hope a split is announced to make that happen sooner. to the executives it may not matter tho if split. regardless im going to get a house off of fb this coming year. in deep. 

p.s. i do tesla, but i like fundamentals more. if you want something that dipped, and could run in a similar fashion to tesla based off solid numbers and earnings.....fb is so profitable. 27% net profit this past quarter. no risk pandemic or not. hop in you can build a house next to me",zolo-bard,wallstreetbets,23.0

46,2020-09-04,"Softbank isn't bagholding anything. Who do you think made all the money here? 

Softbank buys billions in OTM calls on a few specific tech stocks; apple, tesla, Nvidia, Facebook (the FB movement i found the most suspicious and out of character). This forces MMs to hedge massive amount of delta and buy 100s of billions in shares of those specific stocks (the MMs aren't going to say no to free money of course). This pumps the value of Softbank's shares and calls. 

This also gives Softbank control over an absolutely massive amount of shares; 100s of billions worth. This means they can dump the market whenever they want.

This also allowed them to sell billions in deep OTM calls past their strike prices because they knew they could prevent the market from ever reaching those strikes by exercising their calls and dumping the shares.

They picked a perfect time right after the splits and Nvidia gfx release to catch the wave of peak fomo then get out. They exercised tons of itm calls allowing them to dump notional share values of 100s of billions on the market. The made the difference between strike price and their sell price, crushed the value of the calls they sold, and massively reduced the cost basis of the shares the original bought as long term holds.

36,2020-09-06,"Nah it's not bearish at all, just slightly bullish. I usually sell .2 to .1 delta so fairly OTM. Sometimes they really go on a run and I get fucked by capping the gains but it is what it is.

It really depends on the strike and conditions at the time. Let's say CRWD ran from 120 to 150 just cuz of ZM and all these other cloud/rona plays getting pumped. I sell NTM or ITM shit and capitalize on 300% IV during ER week. Shit isn't going to last (and it didn't). 

But let's say if you're holding NVDA or FB, you'll want far enough out OTM to capture any further build up without limiting gains too much. If the premiums don't seem to be worth it even after hitting your potential assigned price, then you're better off not selling calls.

You can easily get stuck bagholding a shit position and locking up your capital too. One such example was my BA baghold from March until their recent ER. I sold puts and got my ass assigned. Avg was like 190. Sold calls during March crazies and reduced cost basis to 170.

Kept selling calls but got stuck when BA went on a run to $220+ and I had freaking 180c sold. I had no choice but to roll it out for credit. Eventually that rolled call expired worthless but I was stuck in limbo again. Anyways I eventually got out of that trade with ok gains given I sold calls thru the entire baghold and never got assigned but man that was wasted energy over 18-19k stuck in capital only to net like 2-3k after 6 months.",freehouse_throwaway,wallstreetbets,36.0

Second, Pinterest has the highest happy user feedback by a huge number when comparing to FB/Twitter. Not only that, there is no controversy on this site. Huge for ad spending. 

Third, Pinterest has beefed up a lot of cool technical features such as searching for product by image. 

As lame as it sounds, Pinterest is a buying catalog for the new world. People can pin what they like and be matched with products, and the Shopify partnership can take them to directly being able to buy that product. How is this not easy money?

Checked June 11th, July 13th &amp; 23rd. Vix was high then as well, and aapl still high on the RSI. So I was less worried about this particular play.

More confirmation bias is that Russia's Moscow Exchange is adding AAPL on the 8th, it added NVDA to it's exchange on Aug 24th and look what happened a intraday 10 point move. I think NVDA actually closed 10 points higher.

People keep talking about sector rotation but we likely won't see a true one until after coronavirus is really handled either by faking the numbers or having a vaccine so be weary of these mini pumps that only end up dumping within a weeks.

Financials will likely be depressed until we get higher interest rates so they will probably be depressed forever.

PTON and CHWY are dumb as shit but once the sell off has stabilized it might be good to keep an eye out for upward movement on these as investors don't know where to put their money and the big tech names are already super inflated.

JD seems really undervalued and it seems worth it to play them into earnings and maybe hold a few contracts through earnings.

Half the time financial media reports on the reasons for a market movement they're wrong. Half the financial media reports on the reasons for a market movement they're lying. A tenth of the time they're half right while also simultaneously being half wrong or lying.

That being said the soft bank thing is real in the sense that call to put ratio has been wildly inflated the past few months and calls on individual stocks have been at an all time high meaning other actors such as hedge funds have likely been doing the same strat as soft bank leading to a huge gamma squeeze but it probably wasnt just soft bank alone.

In the current market environment the macro trend will usually trump the trend of a specific stock, you can be right about a stock in particular but market sentiment is heavily affected by current sentiment on AAPL, TSLA, MSFT, AMZN, FB, and GOOG. Im not sure this is what happened to CHWY and PTON but it might have something to do with it. If there's a shift in the sentiment on the big guys its probably worth it to reposition on other stocks as well. That being said I think we're gonna have a little bit of optimism at the beginning of the next week on the big tech guys but I heard big banks have to do book keeping Q1 and Q3 so we might see some selling through the end of the week next week. My current prediction is green AF Monday followed by selling through Friday.

After that I think big tech will start to settle into a range and go flatish for a while and we'll see upward momentum in CHWY, PTON type stocks as well as chinese tech like JD. Maybe even GLD and SLV as investors will be looking for where to park their $$. Some people think we're gonna see Feb March type crash again. No. That will never happen again, it was a once in a life time thing and when it happens again it will be during a time when no one sees it coming and everyone has forgotten such a crash was even possible. I am doing my part by forgetting that its possible right now but it will likely be years before everybody has forgotten that its possible and then maybe we'll see another crash like that again but not any time soon.

Lastly all of this is probably bullshit and will end up being wrong the number one thing about these big picture thesis stuff is that you're always looking for why you might be wrong and/or why you might be right but you're early because market sentiment isn't going to catch up fast enough to be worth the theta you're burning. The other post I made I think has good mantras that are generally relevant but this post is mostly random predictions Im making about the future and people are almost always wrong when they try to predict the future, including me.

Also ZM is stupid as fuck but I'm not shorting it, it has retard strength and schools are using it now. But it sucks and it has hella competitors in its niche.

Sorry for rambling if theres anything important Ive said it's to be patient. The biggest advantage you have over an institutional trader is that institutional traders have to be in a position all the time, they are constantly trading like it's their job. Don't try to beat them at their job. Just be the guy that sits and waits for the really obvious trades to come along, gets in on those trades, and captures some gains on the way up so they dont get caught with the bag.",GenuineArdvark,wallstreetbets,4.0

14,2020-09-12,"Seeing people think aapl will go back up to 130 is fucking baffling to me. Sure fundamentals may not matter as much in this market, especially for small caps, but it still matters for large cap companies like FAAMG, especially aapl. I remember seeing aapl hit 130-135 post split and saw the P/E ratio was 40. Meanwhile msft fb goog were sitting at ~35 ish. Either this meant aapl was going down or msft fb goog were gunna go up to match p/e’s. Historical p/e average for faamg is ~20. The “fundamentals don’t matter” mentality is exactly the reason why we get nasty corrections every month. However, now that aapl is down at 112, it’s PE is more inline with others, and it seems msft might be the most overvalued now, probably due to the tiktok pump",RayCashIsTrashDalio,wallstreetbets,14.0

21,2020-09-12,"After Q2 earning was released, FB jumped up 8.17% the next day. And FB is already up 13.69% today since its Q2 earning released. So it’s most likely that “ads is coming back in Q3” is already heavily priced in for FB at this point.

On the other hand, Google dropped 3.28% the next day after its Q2 released. And Google is still down 1.47% today since its Q2 released. So when ads comes back in Q3, Google will soar up faster than FB because it is easier for Google to greatly exceed expectation when expectation for  Google is low.

Also, FB even admitted that the new iOS 14 will hurt its ads revenue because of stricter privacy rules.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Self-learning 8 months

\&gt; Most people don't have the discipline to teach themselves for 8 months and if they do, the chances are slim that they're actually learning the right stuff. Very low probability.

&amp;#x200B;

Well if the person doesn't have discipline then no point continuing this conversation. Of course discipline is required. There are many resources that can get you on the right track on what to study for, not hard to find.

\&gt; Job Search 2 months

\&gt; HUGE assumption and likely to not happen. Bootcamp grads either land something immediately thanks to their bootcamp or never find anything, or it takes them a LONG LONG time, especially in this market. I've seen it first hand. The timeline is way longer than 2 months.

&amp;#x200B;

This is just based on a few bootcamp people I know. Fine, increase this to 6 months, doesn't change my argument.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; -2nd year: Grind 1000 Algorithm questions after work

\&gt;  Again, I know what this takes and its unrealistic to expect someone to do this with a full time job. I worked full time as a Software Engineer, attended graduate school full time, and did leetcode with any ounce of free time I had. It takes really hard work and determination, you have to want it really badly, I did at the time. That attitude is definitely in the minority of people.

&amp;#x200B;

I know what it takes too. I did 700 Leetcode questions within 8 months while working full-time as a SWE. I started basically where a bootcamp grad would be: could not solve 2sum, 7 years post graduation, skipped all my algo classes, etc.I was able to breeze all LC style interviews except 1 round at Google. 1000 questions is put there to be ""conservative"".

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Get into large tech

\&gt; You're taking this for granted, maybe 1% of software engineers get into big tech. Forget getting in, most don't even get an interview. Its harder to get in to Google than it is to get into Harvard statistically. Is it possible? Yes. Is it likely? Absolutely not.

&amp;#x200B;

It's definitely easier than getting into Harvard, getting your resume looked at is a crapshoot, but I think you have a good shot at getting at least a few interviews from the top 25 tech companies. Once you get a phone screen, the amount of LC practice will make it a breeze.

In the worst case, going to a mid-tier tech company is fine too. Many people make the jump from senior eng from a mid-tier company or even startup to L5 at FANG.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Grind 4 years from L3-L5

\&gt; Assuming 4 years from L3-L5 (assuming you're using Google levels) is interesting, you need to land on high impact projects but fine lets just give you this one and say fair enough.

High impact projects could get you L3 to L5 in 3 years as a new grad. 4 years is pretty generous for someone with 2 YOE. At places like FB, if you can't see L5 after 4 years, you'll probably be pipped out anyways for not reaching terminal level.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Do another 300 Algorithm questions

\&gt; Arbitrary but ok? At this point interviews are more system design and leadership than algorithms but ok.

&amp;#x200B;

Ya it is arbitrary. Just a conservative estimate for someone to get back into interview shape. At L5 level, interviews will still be LC heavy. Google will be 1 sys design, 3 LC, 1 behavioral. FB will be 1 sys design, 2 LC, 1 behavioral, plus all phone screens will be LC.

Of course you will need to study system design, but that can be done similarly to how one can study LC. In the worst case, you dont do well in sys design and get downleveled to L4. Oh well, you make 300K instead of 400K. :shrug:

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; 400K annual compensation

\&gt; Ok but to get to this point \*\*\***AS A BOOTCAMP GRAD\*\*\*** you are probably in the 0.001% of bootcamp grads who had the grit and perseverance to make it that far and even then someone with a CS degree is looking past that trying to breach principal/partner level, which a bootcamp grad will almost certainly never reach.

Sure, even most CS grads wont make it past L5. At that point, the easiest path is likely Management rather than Staff Eng. But most people will be content with L5 FANG salary.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; So your path is do-able, but it is by no means conservative. Its so far in the minority that if a bootcamp tried to pitch this to me as a ""standard path"" I'd run as far as I could.

It is a conservative timeline for someone who is highly motivated and has reasonable intelligence. Didn't say people with low motivation and low intelligence can achieve this. Even if someone doesn't achieve all this, they can still carve out a nice career making 200K in a coastal city or 100K in a LCOL",neverwinxii,wallstreetbets,12.0

15,2020-10-07,"I don't think Google's ad matching is quite the same...   


Google: I do a few searches for engagement rings, Google serves me ads for engagement rings in the search results based on who paid the most to show me their rings and then shows me more ads in AdWords spots based on roughly the same criteria (the highest bidder.

Palantir: I provide a few examples of engagement rings my fiance likes, and Palantir finds me the exact engagement ring that my fiance wants at the price I can afford.

That might be super simplified, and I'm sure Google has some cutting edge AI stuff going on as well, but what I understand is that beyond that, Palantir can match incomplete data sets.

I don't quite understand the ethics argument - if people don't want the government to be hunting down and deporting illegal immigrants, then they should protest the government, or better yet, get involved with politics and make changes to the law itself so that the government reflects the will of the people.

As for mining publicly available information, which Facebook, Google, and nearly every other company capable doing so does; if you don't want information about you to be in the general public, don't share your whole life on FB, Insta, YouTube, etc.

Besides that, Palantir has repeatedly demonstrated that they are not looking to monetize, sell, or distribute the data they collect, though it would likely be highly profitable to do so... which is again, one of the reasons why they have maintained total control of the company with the F-shares.",hammondish,wallstreetbets,15.0

Their Amazon offered goods actually have data for competing with their third-party sellers.

The barrier to creating a social media site and getting venture capital is too low, when compared to companies like Amazon, for it to be a monopoly.   


If this antitrust was even close to being serious, they would be targeting companies like Amazon and monopolized media outlets.

There is a very large fb group dedicated to trying to recall Samsung refrigerators.  They generally have 2 issues - 


1.) If the ice maker is in the refrigerator (not the freezer) then it condensates and either freezes the fan, stops making ice, and/or dispels water under the fridge drawer.  It can also freeze &amp; burst the line- causing flooding.  



2.) It just stops cooling (that’s what mine did).  It says it’s at temp, but my melted ice cream and multiple thermometers said it was at 64°. Food above 42° is particularly unhealthy and many have gotten sick from them 😕

49,2020-11-02,"LHX. This is an amazing company, the 6th largest company in Aerospace/Defense, that is a better engineering innovator than Lockheed or Raytheon. Unlike those companies, it's generally on time, on budget and successful at delivering on contracts. Consistently makes money and beats earnings. As a growth stock in the sector, it even had good dividends (but not as good as Lockheed's) It was gaining on the top 3 companies in January just before coronavirus. 

It was a sure thing, when coronavirus hit. [Even up to Sept 30, it was on Goldman Sachs' conviction buy list.](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3162976&amp;headline=LHX-LHarris-downgraded-to-Buy-from-Conviction-Buy-at-Goldman-Sachs) But nothing. People are refusing to buy it. So eventually, by around mid-October, it's become officially a Sell, for no reason except no one would buy it. It's now sagging back to about March lows, even tho it's a better aerospace/defense company on fundamentals than Lockheed, Boeing, and Raytheon. I'm watching aerospace companies that have jack shit for potential in the near and long term get lots of speculative money, while L3 Harris just dies on the board every day.

As far as I can tell, it's all because of retail investor rejection and momentum trading following retail investor pop stocks. It's hard for an industry outsider to figure out what the company does (which includes designing and managing the country's entire air traffic control and navigation system and a lot of other civil aviation). Actually, this stock is what led me to recognize the damaging impact of retail investor bubbles on US industrial companies. Right now, capital investment is at the mercy of retail investors, mostly kids, who have no idea about the stocks they're buying and selling. It's turned the market into something like Instagram, where meme stocks are recognized and traded based on their meme capital and not on anything else, really, like value, importance, earnings and market fundamentals. L3 Harris is full of uncommunicative dorks, apparently, and it's hard to figure out what the company does from its shitty, cheap website (whereas the other top defense contractors have cool, dynamic websites designed to pull people who have played video games and distract from the fact that they specialize 100% in killing machines). 

At one point (before I realized that the investing now is dominated by millennials and their meme stocks) I had $80K in LHX, waiting for it to, at minimum, recover the 30-40% of value it should have. I lost about 10% before I realized that right now, the stock market is like social media, where kids have to like it for something to exist. 

Finally, I broke and in tears sold it all off. Now I'm waiting for the US meat economy to go onto its last legs and die, plunging us into a deep economic depression, as real companies starve of capital, shrivel up and die while most of the country's capital investment pours into NVDA, NFLX, AAPL, FB, TSLA and other memes recognizable by children. I cut all my other US industrial and infrastructure investments at the same time, and have watched them continue to go downhill while people frantically plow money into the bubble stocks trying to prop them up for no actual reason that makes any sense, since they can sell them and invest in companies that haven't legs left in their recovery instead of sitting in a bubble. So I'm sitting here, watching the retail investors destroy America's capital investment flows to real meat world industries to throw too much, and unneeded, capital investment at things they recognize without a lot of effort.

25,2020-11-03,"I can see this happening.

Let me paint the scenario for you:

It's Friday, and the votes are in. Chump, whom you voted for, has lost. There's a lot of talk about how the libtards rigged the election and memes all over FB showing how Burisma participated in a huge disinformation campaign against your buddy Chump, but that's just gotten you fired up.

You need to do something, you need to relieve some stress, you need to fucking scream.

It's a party then. DM's fire off to Alex, Chet, Brandon and Mary. You're getting together at Gerald's at 10, bring everyone, bring all the bottles, bring anything.

The white pickups with peeling tint congregate in numbers like your county hasn't seen in years, not since Judy's graduation smash in '15. People are parked on the other side of the neighbors, and Gerald's dad has 51 acres of fallow corn fields that he wrote off as a loss for tax rebates after harvesting for deer feed.

Impressive.

It's wild, party is off the chain and nobody can hear what anybody is saying. Becca showed up, so you naturally start grinding on her to the caterwauling of Luke Combs' ""Lovin' on You."" On the other side of the room is an orangutan someone kidnapped from the zoo during some protests in the city because shit wasn't locked up so why not? He's wearing a MAGA hat and seems to be getting himself quite inebriated. Everyone has decided that he's their personification of Chump and keeps walking by and smacking him on the back mid-swig.

Well it seems that orangutans aren't fond of choking on carbonated beverages, and Becca just happens to be ""in season"", as your jocular and definitely not hyper-masculine and never sexist pals on the varsity team would quip. OraungoDonnie can't get a fix on who is slapping him on the back. He spins one way and sees idiots gesticulating wildly, and he swings the other and sees a bunch of screaming kids around a beer pong table.

He zeroes in on you because he understands how to compete for a mate, and he can smell Becca from across the room. He knows how to handle this situation and he's ready for some blood.

The bellow goes out, you've been challenged and the room goes silent except for the blaring speakers. Next sound is the coffee table being flipped and OranguDonnie is charging. Instincts kick in and you're running after shoving Becca on top of her friends on the couch. There's a quick  loop through the kitchen, when you come back out you find everyone staring, but when OranguDonnie comes out everyone fucking books it.

Shit just got weird.

Forgetting the floor plan of Gerald's you accidentally end up in the laundry room. There's a tense few seconds of OranguDonnie trying to beat down the door and you realize it isn't going to hold, so you grab the ironing board off the wall, let it swing and lay the board on top of OranguDonnie to use as a plank, sliding your way to an escape.

The doors are packed with screaming rednecks when you come back into the living room and OranguDonnie didn't lose any time, he's just behind you. Upstairs is the only option. You take them 3 at a time and just manage to avoid tripping to find the hallway with doors of which you only know where one leads and it has no windows. Your smooth brain calculates the law of averages before you have time to and you instinctively head for the opposite door.

But not before OranguDonnie snakes out one of those creepily long orange arms and grabs your ankle in a death-grip. You go face first in the carpet and next thing you know he's crawling on top of you.

This is when you squealed. You know what type of squeal.

Nobody heard it, you think. Except OranguDonnie, he knows what that squeal means and he raises his hands high to give you a double open-handed ground pound that'd likely have put you out for the weekend if you hadn't somehow managed to worm - literally, do The Worm - and wiggle out from underneath him. He changes tactics to grab you again but only gets your pants, and they come off with minimal effort.

You're off to the door. You're through the door. The piss-flap on your boxers catches on the knob and they give way as you careen into the wall, knock over a chair and fall on the bed.

Into my room that I was renting from Gerald's dad after losing my ass on WSB and having to give up my bachelor pad in the 'burbs. I had been fucking around on my phone for 3 hours trying to pretend there wasn't about to be an orgy downstairs while flipping through Tinder only to find that everything under 40 in possession of a vagina was already at the party because there aren't exactly a lot of options on the ass-end of society and I was probably going to have to swallow a handful of xannies to get to sleep sometime this weekend.

And you land right the fuck on top of me, micropenis shriveled even further from the adrenaline rush of your life being in danger and heading in the wrong direction your balls end up smacking my chin before I get kicked in the head as you scramble for the window. OranguDonnie has ""A moment"" with the door which he doesn't appreciate just swinging any which way it pleases and that affords you the gap you need to get the window open and roll out on the shingle roof, then slide down to freedom.

Giving yourself some absolutely brutal road-rash, the scabs of which will be peeling for months.

19,2020-11-11,"Unless it's an isolated event (like say an isolated AAPL earnings or some good Amazon news), the index usually is the first component that factors into each individual stocks price. It's true it's a cause and effect and you can ask which comes first. But the reason the index matters more is notional amount traded on SPX/NDX and SPY/QQQ is huge and most passive funds are only trading the index or ETF. Thus on a day like today, where QQQ is down, most of the big tech names making it up are down (MSFT, FB, AMZN, TSLA, Apple actually did well but followed a similar intraday pattern to QQQ and somewhat SPY). 

It's not that algos/funds decided to sell each individual tech stock which then drives down QQQ but rather MM/algos/institutions/hedge funds/small amount of retail sold SPY/QQQ (or bought a lot of puts on these - causing options MM to delta hedge by selling shares) and then by doing that, ETF MM have to then also sell these tech names individually as a result to keep the portfolio balanced since there's a direct mathematical formula. Like if you were a fund and you wanted to sell tech, it's clearly much cheaper to just sell the index than go through name by name. 

But this breaks for individual names on a lot of days too with individual events. I'm not even saying Tesla is that correlated but it definitely has some correlation. A name like Microsoft would have an even stronger correlation.",infinitelimits00,wallstreetbets,19.0

36,2020-12-02,People don't take 3 seconds to realize that even GOOG went from $350-&gt;$140 in a year back in the day. Hell it went from $1500-&gt;$1000 this fucking year and is now at $1800. Lots of examples in tech. Unless you went way OTM in short term calls just hold on for a bit and you'll be able to recoup your tendies.

When COVID-19 hit... pretty much cashed out of everything and bought VIXY.  Account balance was somewhere around $50K.

VIXY did spectacularly as things shut down and mass chaos ensued.  

From there took some earnings to buy PDD, NIO, XPEV, LI, FB, AMD, etc etc.  

Then sold out.... bought back in.  Rinse and repeat for a little.

40,2020-12-03,"Holy shit, that’s essentially my take as well, but you have actual examples. I actually used Looker a lot and recommended it to a tard here who went all in on PLTR because he “works” with data, and joining tables together is apparently too hard for him lol, so he is convinced PLTR has some killer product that that just drag and drop, and it gives him not only the data he needs but also analysis, because “ai and shit”. I told him how hard it is to scale their product so it’s generic enough for any company to integrate easily, but he was not convinced. I actually know a FDE, sounds like a horrid job tbh, especially given how hard their interview is, and the things they actually end up doing. 

Maybe PLTR has some niche markets they can explore, but don’t they get their data mostly from FB, Google anyways? These companies spend more on research and dev more than PLTR’s entire revenue, so I honestly don’t see how they have the magic formula/tool. Thanks for the write up!",J_powell_ate_my_asss,wallstreetbets,40.0
41,2020-12-03,"TLDR basically a consulting company, also their software is behind the times compared to cutting edge stuff from GOOG/FB/MSFT in the same fields.

They masquerade as a software company but really they are basically just a consultancy that happens to have some reusable software they sell on the side.

Their financials are stupidly misleading. Sales and marketing account for like 1/3rd their expenses (R&amp;D and administration making up the rest), HOWEVER they have neither sales people (well they are getting some, currently accounts for 3% of head count) and 0 marketing folk.

So you might ask the question, where is all that fucking money going? Well, that is how they pay the consultants. Usually referred to as Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs) they are accounted for under sales and marketing despite being compensated like SV engineers and not being counted in COGS (this is why their gross margin of 80% is also stupidly misleading).

Even if you put all of this aside and assume they have some killer product I have some bad news for you. First of all it's not some magic box you just drop in and it just ""works out where your data is"". That is what the consultants primarily do, write custom integrations for all the bullshit DB2 systems and crap that needs to be ingested.
Then if you assume hey, you need to do that for all competitors too, yes that is true except you can hire -anyone- to do that, you aren't beholden to your vendor + integrator in one (PLTR).

Additionally their competitors just have vastly superior products. GOOG in particular is -FAR- in the lead of everyone, by a literal fucking mile. BigQuery alone dumpsters all things like it (not to mention all things like it are actually copies of it based on the Google Dremel paper). That is without factoring Dataflow, AI Platform, etc. You could argue Data Studio is shit but GOOG doesn't lock you into that, you can go get Looker which is best in class and connect that to BigQuery.

They are a government contractor. If you wouldn't invest in a baby Raytheon or Lockheed then don't invest in PLTR.

Caveats: They could in theory change their product and business model into a more growth friendly package. Eliminate the need for their consultants, preferably make a cloud hosted option of their DB + frontend available, switch to a more traditional sales model that works outside of government etc.

However i am not banking on them doing any of that because if they could have they would have done it 10 years ago.",beefstake,wallstreetbets,41.0

By the time I had my Holiday inventory, I didn't trust they would get it into their warehouses (they were always delayed when I did send them shit). 

And if it wasn't delayed, I was worried they would have to shut down ""non-essential"" shit again where they only accept TP and hand sanitizer into their warehouses again.

As a result, I did 90% Shopify 5% Amazon 5% Etsy this year vs last year maybe 70% shopify / 30% non-Shopify.

eBay did shitty last year and this year.

Used FB for ads that were super profitable, Shopify, and saw a huge bump in Etsy for Xmas.

1,2020-12-11,"I'll grant you that ABNB can suffer a regulatory disaster like Uber is undergoing and FB may undergo.  BUT (and this is a big but) ABNB has elected to work with regulators.  This cuts their margins by adding to expenses of course.  But imo it was a wise and perhaps the most prudent thing to do. 

Now it's entirely possible that their efforts to work with all regulators in all jurisdictions will not or only partially succeed.  However I'm on the side that their entire corporate DNA is to actually work with regulators unlike that bozo Kalanick at Uber (to pick an egregious example) who tried to show he's boss to the very people who can make his life and his organization's life miserable.

Having said all of this I bought a grand 30 shares just to mini YOLO.  If it tanks I stop out.  If I get enough profit to buy a nice dinner then great.  When this starts trading options my guess is it will have whopping IV as the WSB retard factor kicks in and people overpay for puts.

From my experience, any day where I made a substantial amount of money (mainly in April-June) has been from dumb luck. Like I happened to go all-in on AMZN the day before it gained like $100+, or in FB right before they announced Reels (and I never play FB, so that was reallyyyy lucky).

Overcharging has been their MO even when steve jobs was there, so not sure what you’re getting at with that.

If mining rare earth minerals is supposed to be the criteria for calling a company evil, even TSLA sucks then. Should APPL stop producing iphones . Fun fact, don’t all smartphone manufacturers depend on rare earth minerals for their batteries. why just apple?
Ok kids working in factories is certainly not good but I’m pretty sure that’s not something even they want but is an issue with who they contract to manufacture, either way they should fix it. agreed

I am not trying to claim Apple is god’s gift to mankind. Every capitalist company does bad shit to make some cash and governments should reign them in. I just want to point out that your reasoning for calling Apple an evil company are things easily applicable to any company and certainly not the same as what FB managed to do these past few years.

The word of the day for you fucking retards is GUIDANCE.  Chen needs to tell us what the revenue opportunity is with the Amazon partnership (aka IVY) HINT: IT IS HUUUUGE but also WHEN.  When will they make their first IVY dollar. If its in 2021, or even early 2022 watch your fucking butts boys rocket fuel for the quickest double this side of NIO.  

Meanwhile on top of IVY, BB also has 1. a very decent cybersecurity platform  that contracts with major banks and government entities 2. a licensing portfolio that bring in hundreds of mill a year and 3. pending infringement lawsuits against FB and SNAP that if successful will result in a multi billion dollar award.  Everyone also likes their new president of sales from Citrix who is apparently starting to pull in real wins.   

OP is correct, this stock should already be 30bill but boomers feel burnt and most people are still so fucking stupid they don't realize that BB exited the phone biz a few years ago (they license the phone to third parties).  Amazon is taking this partnership very seriously and it will soon be grabbing everyone's attention in a big way.  Open question is why Amazon or another company doesn't see the writing on the wall and buy BB for relatively cheap right now.  30B would get the job done.  Less than that and I don't think BB would do it.  I could go on but whatever, GLTA make money.",TheLooza,wallstreetbets,0.0
