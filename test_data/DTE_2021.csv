7,2021-02-03,"I'm gonna assume you're new to WSB/options and give you a somewhat real answer:

Simply put, options are a way to gamble on stocks. You pay a premium to take control of 100 shares without actually owning them (leverage) and you can pocket the the difference between the strike price and the price of the stock if your position is ITM (in the money). the closer the day till expiration (DTE), the more risky the gamble is.

You can make some insane money if you pick right, but if the underlying stays flat or goes down (if you have calls) or goes up (if you have puts) then you're gonna lose the premium you paid. For example, while a majority of influx users were bagholding their  losing GME stocks yesterday, a lot of other people were making money on a lot of tickers because how how green of a day it was yesterday.

If you're interested in learning more, I can shoot you a video that explains options and I can help you with any further questions you may have.

4,2021-02-10,"A number of reasons. If I've missed anything important someone feel free to add. 

When you've got massive % gains on an options play, lock it in before expiry. If the stock tanks in the last few days, you'll have lost all of that potential money just because you got greedy looking to squeeze a bit more out of it. If you really believe it will keep going up, sell your calls anyway and **buy new options with a later expiration.** So you still win when the underlying share price goes up the next day, but if it has a red day you can just wait it out and ride the recovery. 

With losses, just sell and reinvest in something else. There will not be a miracle spike on the last day. Theta is constantly pushing down the value of your option. But this sub loves seeing diamond hands to 0% so maybe do it anyway.

As for more technical reasons: 
A call gives you the right to buy 100 shares of an asset. If you don't have the cash in your account to buy 100 shares, your broker should automatically sell your call before market close. They don't give a shit about waiting for a good exit price, they'll market sell it as soon as the automated system tells it to. If you do have the cash, it'll execute and you get 100 shares. Now you can't sell until the next morning. Have fun watching after hours charts as your new shares drill down to hell.

Same thing with puts. You don't have 100 shares to sell, so you gotta sell that option before expiry or else they'll do it for you. Better to sell a few days early when you know what you're getting than wait for some freak price action on 0 DTE.

I won't get into multi-leg options. It gets even more complex and I believe in certain edge cases you can get royally screwed by the automatic actions at expiry.

Anyway I highly recommend that options calculator in the OP. You can get a good visual for how much options decay towards the end.",ItsOnlyJustAName,wallstreetbets,4.0

-3% premium per month soft cap for selling cash secured puts, whatever looks the best with a delta of 0.30 for covered calls

-starting with 30 DTE, no later, but maybe earlier depending on the perceived rate of decay between weeks

-aiming for strike prices I wouldn't mind getting exercised for, caring even less if it's a covered call

-have a limit order to buy the covered call or cash secured put back for half the premium (unless it's super illiquid or they don't have weekly options), adjusting it when half of the duration has ran out to leave open the potential to get 1.5% of the collateral in premiums in just a week or something

0,2021-04-07,"```
My Strategy Summarized:
1)  I never fight the trend. If its green, i buy calls. If its red, i buy puts. I will only buy puts on a green day if there is a overall change in market trend. Inversely, calls on a red day
2) Price action is my #1 indicator. I wait for it to confirm my thesis before i enter a trade
3) I only trade SPY Options
4) My baseline is to choose a call/put that has a DTE 6-7 days out, with a strike $2-$3 away. I adjust that to fit my current appetite for volatility. i virtually never play same day DTE's. 
5) I set a 10% stop, but usually exit at 8% before my stop triggers depending on current situation
6) I utilize about 10-20% of my Portfolio for one trade. Sometimes more. Rarely less. 
7) I never hold overnight in these market conditions.
8) I shoot for 10-20% for gains. Depending on market conditions.
9) The main indicators i use are the:
       a) RSI
       b) 8ema
       c) 50 sma
       d) 200 sma
       e) macd
10) I never force a trade. No trade is a good trade too if the entry just isn't there. 
11) Patience always pays off. A great set-up can form in minutes or seconds. I never regret being patient to enter. I nearly always regret rushing into a trade.

12,2021-04-07,"Sure. It isn't hard to imagine how LPs will make purchases in the US. Just look at Curaleaf's approach to the EU as a blueprint of what's coming for LPs entry into the US. 

First off, it would make no sense for most LPs to purchase a ""large"" MSO. Most ""large"" MSOs have built their books by operating vertically integrated markets, and have heavy retail burdens. Retail stores will have little to no value in a legal market. There will be tens of thousands of stores nationwide, so spending 60m+ (Trulieve) on 2 locations is retarded. Like 400%+ breakeven FD's with 0 DTE retarded. 

For comparison, 4Front spent 60m to being construction on their **OVER 500K SQFT** growing facility in Illinois. Their 60m investment will allow them to supply *nations* with Cannabis, in an open legal market. What is Trulieve's 60m purchase of 2 dispensaries going to look like in 2024-2025? It's gonna look like wasted money, that's what. 

Also, I bring up Cronos because they are most likely to make a large MSO purchase. Out of the ""large"" LPs, Cronos is the weakest. Cronos has also said they are focused on brand building. So If *any* LPs were to purchase a large MSO it would be them. It also helps they are sitting on about 1.2B of Altria's money for M&amp;A. 

However like I said before, it just doesn't make sense for LPs to purchase large footprint MSOs. They are already sitting on an excess of cannabis and grow space, they just need the markets MSOs operate in. Not the MSOs themselves",OverwatchNWeed,wallstreetbets,12.0

0,2021-05-06,"I'll help you out because I can tell you are new and I'm not petty.  You can thank me later.

1.  Look for stocks with high ivr.  IVR is a measure of the implied volatility of the underlying.  High implied volatility means that options are trading rich and you can sell the high premium.  The central thesis is that implied volatility is mean reverting and will eventually drop.  When iv drops options lose value.  This is what we are looking to profit from.
2. If you are wrong then you can roll out your position for  credit and wait it out.  Always trade small so you don't get knocked out of the game.  This strategy works more often than not and has positive expected value so as long as you don't risk everything in one trade you can keep playing the game and profit long run.
3. The setup:  If you want to sell naked then sell a call and a put both with 5 deltas.  If you want to sell defined risk with things like condors and spreads then try to collect 1/3 the width of the strike in premium.  If the market hits your short strike on the defined risk spread then roll it out a month when the market is near the same price as your short strike.  If you are selling strangles then roll up and out when your delta gets to around 25.  All positions should have 45 days to expiration.  Collect profits at 50% max profit or 21 dte.   Wait out the losers.
4. This isn't a ""retail"" tip.  It's what the options market makers do.  You can find more info here.

2,2021-05-11,"Hello,

Not sure what you are asking but will try.

A leap is a long dated option. You need a leap in order to have an effective pmcc. In my opinion having the long leg, option you are betting will increase, that is too short dated will not give you enough time to collect premium on the short leg, option you are getting that the stock price will not hit in that timeframe. 

The long leg should be at least... 9 months out to make effective use of the lower rate of Theta decay for longer dated options. This is a call that is purchased in the money to make it replicate the share price as much as possible. Depending on what source you are reading it should have a delta of around 70-85. 

The short leg, stock price no touchy, should expire much, much sooner. Say 7-45 dte. In my, HOLY SHIT THIS GUY IS WRONG AND EVIL NEEDS TO BE KILLED BECAUSE HE IS SUGGESTING SOMETHING THAT IS CONTRARY TO WHAT I READ ON INVESTOPEDIA, you need to have a 50+ difference in delta. Yes that makes it harder to get larger returns on the short leg. You are trying to compliment your returns on the leap with covered calls. It's poor man because the leap is cheaper then the shares.

Open up your robinhood options chain, make sure calls are selected. Scroll out a year and go in the money. Go down a couple lines and select the option. Will have some highlighted numbers in the middle left. Click those. Scroll down until you see the section called the greeks. Top right corner will have delta. If it's in between 70-85 write that number down. Subtract 50. This is your new target deltascroll back to the 30 day or so date range and find an out of the money option with that target delta.

You now have 2 options you need to buy and sell. Top left corner of the options list will have a buy/sell button. Click sell. Top right will have a button titled select. Click that. Select the short leg option you found in step 2. Scroll back to the option you found in step one. Top left corner of options chain select buy. Select option. Submit. You will have a net debit of the cost of your leap minus the Profit made from selling the short leg. Submit again.

Wait. 

Hopefully stock price has increased. 

Enter diagonal spread from main stock screen, or home page. Enter the short leg of the spread. Roll the short leg to whatever strike makes sense using the select  button to buy to close and sell to open the new short leg. 

Repeat. 

Close entire spread when delta of the long dated option reaches 90ish, or theta decay has start to make you feel uncomfortable or the underlying is tanking, or any number of reasons. This is done on the spread page before you select individual legs. 

Watch stock continue to rise.

Aquire fomo

Repeat process.

Watch underlying start to drop.

Roll short leg to mitigate. 

Stock either sharply rises obliterating your short leg, or tanks cutting your leap in half.

Right now with the volatilty IV is like 300% which is insane right now. Meaning you need constant price movements to keep the value up.

Basically their overpriced right now due to hype / buying pressure. Its like an auction for a chance to preorder the new Nikes , price is set by the amount of froth from buyers.

Also strike price and DTE are factors to consider in your risk model.

I.e how far away from the current price it could go and in what timeframe.

I think we are going into a bullish channel on a Quartly timeframe but I am more of a technical trader.

Trades are taken in relation the the amount of risk you are comfortable with.

You dont like a lot of risk go for 30-45 DTE ITM/ATM strikes, so a july or august 14/15 strike.

If you are insanly risky then you could bet on a 6/11 40c or that BB while be over $40 by this come Friday.

The probable likelyhood of either of those scenarios are vastly different and as such have a payout that reflects that.

You get more money if the riskier bet hits but has a less chance, hence why they are called lotto tickets.

This subs bread and butter.

The first play is more of a ""calculated trade"" the secound is a ""bet""

Its up to you to define your risk comfort levels.

1,2021-06-09,"BB won't Moon bc its near it fair valuation.  It's almost double or more than double where it was when it was first posted in Dec.  Its a great company and worth a long term investment, but it NEVER was a short squeeze play.

GME is probably way over vakued against its fundamentals and the remaining shorts have the liquidity to keep losing money on interest indefinitely.  Yes, it might keep going up, but probably not at the rate the others are going to at this point.  Yes, you missed the boat on GME... SHOCKING, but that was Jan/Feb and its now JUNE.

AMC has mooned twice and is in a similar position to GME.  However, it has fuck tons of outstanding shares and its valuation is probably half where the ticker is now.  Again, the shorts that dont have the liquidity have probably covered.  Not to mention that they keep printing more shares.  $50 a share for AMC is way more than anyone should ever pay for it.  

CLOV is just getting to where it valuation is, but still has tons of shorts that need to cover.  This is probably the only ticker of the 4 that should have any momentum left, but thats because it just started.   Everyone on WSB should be in this one now, and if you aren't, fuck you for being DUMB AS SHIT!

NOW FOR SOME VENTING ABOUT HOW RETARDED YOU ARE:

Apes need to learn when to rotate but cant bc they are fucking apes.  so they make posts like this suggesting that one stock is getting in the way of the other.  back in the way back when, before the GME squeeze, we didnt have whiney ass posts from some ape winging that his stock is getting getting screwed bc it wasnt going up 50% or more a day.  Those kind of gains arent sustainable and never will be.  rotate with the current meme or watch you gain stagnate or depreciate.  those of us that have been here since before GME understand that you should have A GOD DAMN EXIT STRATEGY.  Not having one not only makes you retarded, but garantees you wont ever book any actual god dman gains.  STOP BITCHING THAT YOUR STONK THATS UP 10K% isnt going up anymore.  FFS you ppl on GME and AMC should be happy you arent losing money at this point.  WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU.  You want to diamond hand the rip into a dip, into another rip, into another dip and then bitch about things need to GTFO.  Seriously, how can you be this god damn retarded!?!?  these stock have made once in a lifetime moves and you bitch that it isnt enough!?!?  learn how theres more than 4 god damn stock tickers in the world and stop being so fucking lazy and stupid you god damn apes!!!!

BTW if you bought $100 of options in GME in JAN, rolled it over into AMC a month ago, then rolled that over into CLOV last week, you'd be a god damn millionaire and then some.  WHAT MORE DO YOU FUCKING WANT?  WSB will pay out if you just put $100 into 6 month calls of half the damn ticker mentioned here.  YOU HAVE TO BE BEYOND RETARDED TO HAVE FAILED TO MAKE PILES OF MONEY AT THIS POINT!!!! IF you havent made piles of money so far, no amount of diamond hand or ape memes is going to help you.  You were clearly destined to be poor and should go give blowies behind you local Wendy's for $20 a piece.  AND if that s you, just LMK which Wendy's so i can give you 1/10000000 of the gains i've made off of AMC and CLOV this month to nut on your retarded af face.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER WSB.  ALL THE SHORTS IN ALL THESE COMPANIES ARE HEDGIES AND RETAIL GAY BEARS.  YOU ARE NOT ""STICKING IT TO THE HEDGIES"" MORE BY BEING IN ONE OF THESE VERSUS ANY OF THE OTHERS.  THERE ARE MORE GAY BEARS IN CLOV NOW THAN AMC AND GME COMBINED.  TWO WEEKS FROM NOW THE HEDGIES IN CLOV WILL HAVE HAD IT STUCK TO AND THERE WILL BE THE NEXT THING.  LEARN TO ROTATE YOU GOD DAMN RETARDED APES.  WSB ISNT ABOUT ONE STONK.  ITS ABOUT US GAMBLING AND MAKING MONEY AS A COMMUNITY (and if some hedgies and gay bears get hurt in the process, great!).  IF YOU ARE STUCK IN PLAYS FROM 6 MONTH AGO YOU DESERVE YOUR LOSES OR LACK OF GAINS BECAUSE YOU ARE DUMB AND LAZY AS SHIT!  STOP BEING THIS WAY OR LEARN TO LOVE WATCHING YOUR WIFE GET RAILED BY HER BOYFRIEND WHO PARLAYS GME INTO AMC INTO CLOV AND HAS A $100M WEBULL ACCOUNT NOW.  MAKE MOVES AND GET YOUR TENDIES LIKE ALL OF US AUTISTS AND RETARDS DID BEFORE YOU.   YOLO ON 0 DTE OTM CALLS BECAUSE THATS WHAT WE DO.  IF YOU WANT TO CRY ABOUT PEOPLE INVESTING IN A STOCK YOU DONT THINK IS RIGHT THEN HIRE A THERAPIST.  JUST KNOW THAT THAT THERAPIST WILL HAVE AN EXIT STRATEGY MAKE LOTS OF TENDIES AND STEAL YOU WIFE.  AS SHOULD BE BECAUSE YOU ARE A LAZY POS THAT DOESNT DESERVE TENDIES.

The credit received is a lot less then your max loss so people are usually too afraid to trade them but they're so consistently profitable you really don't have to worry. Basically just cut trades if the loss is ever equal to twice the credit received and this will work 9/10 times and the one time you lose can easily be made up in two more trades.

2,2021-07-02,"AMC is very lucrative right now due to high IV as you are already aware. Because of the high IV i find selling strikes 25-30% OTM (for example $70 strike based on current amc price) very safe, and if you do 15-20 DTE you can collect 6-9% premiums depending on IV levels.

So based on current amc prices i am selling $70-$75 strikes for 2-3 weeks expiration and i buy them back during the last week when they are down 80% because the remaining 20% takes way too long to melt away.

My fail safe tactic with amc is that if AMC reaches my strike price, I will instantly buy my contracts back (for higher price than i sold them for) and then I will simultaneously sell new calls sith strikes for $10-$15 higher ($80-$85 range) while adding 2 or 3 weeks of time on them so that i can essentially move my strike higher without losing money, and this way i can keep making money on my amc stack as price passes $70, rather than having my profits capped at $70 strike and having the stocks called away.

Hope that helps mate good luck!

Selling sub 30dte while theta is high means that it has already ate away at the premium you could have had if you had wrote it earlier.

If the Greeks and numbers show strength in weekly premiums, then sell weeklys.

One factor to remember though that affects your theory here. Options expire at close Friday, meaning you would have to wait until Monday to write again, so really you only have 5 days from write to expiration, which will also eat away at realized premiums.

2,2021-07-03,"No fuckwit, its a combination of both shares and calls. The problem isn't they're not buying shares. Its that they're stacking their calls vertically across strikes on near term dates so that as soon as theta starts ticking its driving their premiums into the ground. Premium decays, delta decays, shares that hedged the calls get sold, and a death spiral begins entirely based on simple market mechanics. Regardless if they bought shares or not, the downward pressure of their short term calls expiring would kill them either way.

The way they fix this is buying short term ATM calls, as well as a mix of strikes further out. For example, 12 DTE WISH 12c, then August 14c, then October 16c or 20c. Then they back the calls with some shares. The market makers will provide the fuel to lever the stock up buying shares. The value investors hold the shares, and as the calls approach 1 delta, cash out a percentage to cover the cost of the calls and exercise the rest. The exercise moves the shares from the market makers to value investors, and then you pump the stock again with more call buying at new short term ATM options.",BackgroundSearch30,wallstreetbets,2.0

10,2021-07-08,"I don't have any books to recommend. The way I go about this is to just read the docs. For VIX that means to read the formula and make sure you understand how it works and what the implications are. Then you can come up with good strategies.

Like I said in the first post, the VIX is just implied volatility. The prices of SPX options imply a certain move for SPX within the next 30 days with 1 standard deviation. Then annualize it and you get the VIX.

So for example when the VIX is at 30, option prices with around 30 DTE imply that there's a 68% chance that the average daily move of SPX will be less than 1.9% (30/sqrt(252)).

You might have noticed that most of the time VIX is around 15, so how can that be when we know that on average the markets only move 7% per year? Well, it just means that options are generally overpriced. Kind regards to theta gang.

Calling my shot now.",commitpushdrink,wallstreetbets,1.0
2,2021-09-02,"Just do it. Buy $100-200 in calls on something you think will go up for whatever reason, buy $100-200 in puts on something you think will go down for whatever reason.

Base the expiration date on when you think this movement might happen + some cushion.

If the options you chose go +20% or more in value, cash out, because as it approaches the date you chose, it will have to wildly swing in the direction you chose (up for calls, down for puts) to make the same +20%.

Example: stock is $100, you buy $120 calls (120c) expiring in 5 weeks. It immediately goes to $105, your calls are +20%. It hangs out at $105 for a week, your calls are +5%. It hangs out at $105 for 2 more weeks, your calls are -15%. It jumps to $112, your calls are +10%. It goes to $114 with 2 weeks left til expiration, +12%. It goes down to $109, -30%. It goes to $107 with a week to go, -48%. It hits $110 again, -62%. $111 -78%. $114 with 1 DTE -90%. On the last day, it's $116, the highest it's ever been, but your calls are nearly worthless.

Example2: stock is $100, you buy $80 puts (80p) that expire in 5 weeks. Stock goes to $110, your puts go -20% right off the bat. Stock goes back to $100, your puts are -5% (because you're closer to expiration). Stock plummets to $85, your puts are +40% but only for that one day. It rebounds to $92, your puts are now +12%.

So basically, big moves in the chosen direction far from expiration date are your best bet, that's ideal. As you approach expiration, moves in the chosen direction react far less, and your options behave according to what's called theta, it decays.

But the farther out you buy, the more expensive the options are. In the end, it's literally betting on the stock moving in the direction you think it will and the earlier it does that the better it is for you.

120c on a $100 stock is more expensive than 200c on $100 stock, and a 120c that expires in 4 months is more expensive than a 120c that expires in 4 days. But if the 4 monther has the stock go $100 -&gt; $120 on day 2, that sucker will print like a MF. The one that's now 2 DTE will print, just nowhere near as much as the 4 monther. But if you didn't cash out the 4mo during that and it stays $120 for several weeks, you'll see your gains slowly diminish.

It won't be massive $50k gains from a $500 investment but you can grow your account by $100-$250 every day or two if you do this consistently and remember not to get greedy.

16,2021-12-03,"So I felt the market is going to be bearish or sideways for the next few weeks. When my SP hit 2.8 I was red 10%. But instead of selling I wrote covered calls with 55 DTE, 10% OTM from my cost basis. Meaning the stock would need to move linearly 20% and hold above for me to incur any loss of opportunity cost (if it jumped to 6 dollars by tomorrow I‚Äôd lose out on $15,000 of gains). But instead I‚Äôm rewarded $800 in premium which is what I would occur in loss of the stock fell to 2.62.

I‚Äôm expecting a reversal in the mid term (next four-five months). Today we fell another 8% which is okay. My covered call hedged enough that out of that I only am losing 2% of my total position.

But, because im bullish mid term and the technicals on the daily feel ripe for reversal, I put away $2500 as collateral to write $5 puts for mid March

I don‚Äôt actually plan to hold the puts. But I intentionally dated them for twice as long as my covered call because, in the case that the stock moves to 3.5 before my call expires, my put will decay enough delta that I could essentially ‚Äúroll out‚Äù at break even, and then let the stock ride.

So I write a covered call at .18 bid (45 contracts) 3.5 strike. I collect $800 premium. If, say, we are trading at 3.5 a week into expiration, the theta decay would balance out delta. After the stock breaks 3.5 I‚Äôm expecting a breakout on the underlying.

However, my put, which has now lost three-four weeks of theta, and also has now lost a considerable amount of delta (about 30%), is now worth 60-70% below what I sold it for. Because I do not want to run the risk of buying expensive shares (and I want to free up my collateral to buy more shares at 3.5 instead of 5) I buy the put contract back.

So the strategy goes like this:

Stock closes below 3.5 on 1/21/22 I collect $800 from the covered call, and my cash secured put has about a $500-600 profit. I met $1200-1400 in gains from premium. 

Stock closes ABOVE 3.5 by 1/21. Instead it hits $5. My CSP is worthless and I sell it for pennies. Because of my cost basis and my premium collection, I collect $2300 in gains. But because of my covered call capping my gains, I lose out on $7335 in profit if I sold at $5.

Then the last case (which is sort of worst case) is the stock trades below $5 until 3/18. It goes so far red that my underlying causes me to lose another 10-20% and ontop of that I cannot get out of my CSP contract because it‚Äôs now exceeded so far in value that to buy the contract back (exit the position) would cost me 3-4x what I paid for it. I still collect the premium from the covered call and the CSP, but the hedge only works up for the price falling another 10%. I would also have to buy 500 shares of the stock at 5/share. Which is not a big deal if the stock closes at 3.5/4 a share, or hell even 4.99 share.

The idea of doing this for me at least is you cannot bet on one direction in the market, ever. But you can bet on time.",JGWol,wallstreetbets,16.0

8,2021-12-05,"Everyone has different approaches to DTE. I think it‚Äôs based around how much you don‚Äôt want to get assigned.

For example my covered call I have dated two months earlier than my CSP. My CC is 10% from my cost basis so I‚Äôll still earn money if it exercises. And if that happens, my CSP will lose enough delta that I could scalp. Turning what would be a $750 return from just stock at 3.5 to $2500 (including premium from the CSP and CC)

However, I wouldn‚Äôt do the inverse. I don‚Äôt want my ITM put exercising. Buying shares 2x the market price doesn‚Äôt sit with me even if I like the stock. But the premium is tantalizing. While I could make ‚Äúquicker money‚Äù doing an OTM put with less theta, I feel like if the charts point to a quick reversal, I would be losing out if I didn‚Äôt capitalize on the premiums.

Because that‚Äôs the thing about selling far out. People will say ‚Äúbut you don‚Äôt get the theta decay till 15-30DTE‚Äù.. well yes, but you‚Äôre also increasing your chances of getting assigned. And, people
Forget that in terms of scalping, delta works in your favor.

Take my ITM put. I bought it for 2.8/contract when the stock was at $2.5 for a $5 strike. That means I am being paid $2.8/share to take the risk of buying shares at 50% cost. And people say ‚Äúdelta is the probability a stock will hit a certain price. Go 0.3 delta for a 66% chance of not getting assigned‚Äù

Okay but the problem with that is, the premium collection is so low that it‚Äôs not actually hedging my underlying during sharp turns down or, creating decent scalping opportunities on sharp reversals. My Deep ITM CSP is gives me 13% premium. Meaning if the stock hit around 2.3/share I would be delta neutral.

But, say the stock goes up 2 delta in a month. My CC would already be expired worthless (where I collect $.18 premium per share) AND the delta loss plus theta decay would make my CSP go from 2.34 &gt; 0.8/contract. I would be able to scalp the contract for $340. But with a month left to expire I would feel comfortable holding and getting assigned because

I bought the put at 2.5 for 2.58 premium, so my break even on the shares is actually 2.42/share. So, assuming the stock stays above 2.42 in five months, I‚Äôm actually making a net gain even if I get exercised. Whereas the opposite would occur if I was doing short term, OTM puts and got assigned.",JGWol,wallstreetbets,8.0
