0,2018-01-02,"I don't think you realize the difference between design of ICs/chips versus fabricating the chips. Design engineers don't know how to fab chips and fab and process engineers don't know how to tape-out. 2) Not all fabs are the same. Apple is using this fab to test MEMS and other exotic chips that are not standard digital CMOS that TSMC/IBM don't have the tech to do, just like how Apple bought Finisar for VCSEL production (non standard digital).


Chipotle buying AMD is more likely than Apple or Google having its own advanced-node (10nm and below) fab. I would be will to bet everything on that. Keep in mind that you need A LOT OF manpower to get the yield to process standards and to do this you need many fabs to justify. Apple buying a fab company is more likely than getting its own single fab. No way (san) Jose.


EDIT: Google vacuuming design engineers = these engineers are ASIC engineers not process engineers. And the TPUs are taped-out in TSMC nodes (just like Nvidia's GPUs and Apple SoCs).",SeekingTheta,wallstreetbets,0.0
1,2018-01-02,"Apple is also working on its own fab because they caught on to how inefficient it is for their design engineers to pass through layers of legal red tape before communicating with the fabs process engineers in joint development ventures. Relying on an independent fab has a very negative impact on the productization time and AMD has been limping behind it's competitors for years because they can't qual their chips fast enough. It doesn't matter how groundbreaking their designs are, if the product engineers can't effectively coordinate with all of the other engineering teams to deal with yield issues the time to market will get fucked.

60,2018-01-02,"&gt; Design engineers don't know how to fab chips and fab and process engineers don't know how to tape-out

The design engineers are deeply involved in the manufacturing process. These chips go through multiple design iterations to deal with yield and performance issues before they ever reach a point where they can operate within spec. Design is involved all the way from tapeout to validation to qual. Having worked at a fabless IC designer I know how negative the impact of being fabless is on the product engineers' ability to do their bench work and lead taskforces that deal with yield issues. Our ability to coordinate design, test and process was constantly slowed down by the legal teams. Now AMD may have a better sympatico with their fabs than we did but having your RnD split between two corporate entities will always be less efficient than a unified process.

&gt;Apple buying a fab company is more likely than getting its own single fab

I believe this will happen sometime in the future. The tech giants have reached a certain point in maturity where split HW/SW strategies are not sustainable. Performance issues that a software engineer could solve at the cost of doubling their power requirements are now solved by tweaking the hardware design itself. 

Now that they've shifted into IC design the next logical step will be to own the manufacturing process as well. Because of anti-trust laws and being separate entities, design revisions that would normally take days to send to the fab take weeks of negotiations. To remain competitive and protect their own IP they will eventually decide that they need to have both their design and process under a single entity with a unified corporate culture.

As a result, **AMD CPUs will feel a performance hit as well**, though the bug only technically affects Intel CPUs and AMD recommends specifically not to enable the patch for Linux. How Microsoft specifically will address the issue with the Windows operating system remains unclear until the company's formal Patch Tuesday update is made known, hopefully soon.

23,2018-01-04,"My TL/DR: Read the excerpt I've pasted in, but here's my take: 1) They (Google Zero Day) have three different flavors of failure. Two of them are specific to Intel hardware (unless you enable the non-default AMD PRO flag for BPF JIT). So the truthiness seems to be that flavor one is widespread, and causes/allows processes to bypass their own bounds, and read their own stuff. This does not allow 'crossing privilege boundaries'. So a VM or an application with a Virtual Memory allocation can disobey rules to read it's own space.

2) In (at least Haswell Xeon, and AMD PRO only if you enable a non-default setting) some Intel hardware (and AMD see before) will allow exploits of a 4GiB range of the kernel virtual memory space. This may be out-of-process allocated space. Meaning, somebody else's VM / host machines keys etc.

3&amp;4) There are further exploits possible on at least Intel Xeon Haswell generation on an ""outdated"" version of Debian (and maybe sub-versioned distros?). It allows for very fast sampling of the of the compromised virtual page space, and even reading kernel memory.

TL;IaF:
This is a shit tsunami about to subsume the enterprise world.  Especially for the virtual machine farms (Fecesbook, Goolagle)

If by the end of the month AMD is at 12.50  I am stoked because I sold the option however since it was out the money I get to keep my shares.   If at the end of the month AMD is at 15 I am a little bummed because I am forced to sell at 13.50, however am I really bummed because I made a profit on the shares since I bought at 10.50 and sold a contract and made the $ for the option.

So yes the AMD covered calls do not expire yet.   I made the $$ off the premium.    I was hoping it would hold about 12.50 or so so in two weeks I could sell the covered calls again at 14.50 or so.   and continue this until either the shares get called away or I get enough $$ for your mother to come over and suck my fat dick.

From the register article (https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/01/02/intel_cpu_design_flaw/ ):

&gt; These KPTI patches move the kernel into a completely separate address space, so it's not just invisible to a running process, it's not even there at all. Really, this shouldn't be needed, but **clearly there is a flaw in Intel's silicon that allows kernel access protections to be bypassed in some way**.

Further:

&gt;It appears, from what AMD software engineer Tom Lendacky was suggesting above, **that Intel's CPUs speculatively execute code potentially without performing security checks**. It seems it may be possible to craft software in such a way that the processor starts executing an instruction that would normally be blocked – such as reading kernel memory from user mode – and completes that instruction before the privilege level check occurs.

Some folks found a critical hardware security issue in Intel x86 processors that essentially makes a large majority of the cloud computing model fundamentally insecure with those CPUs (virtual machines no longer securely isolated).  The fix for this in software is showing something like a 30% performance hit.  The hardware can never be fixed, and this covers all Intel x86 chips from all generations in the past 10 years or more.  Millions and millions of servers.

AMD chips are not subject to the flaw, and not to mention they essentially just got 30% faster.

We’ll see how it plays out, but this could very well be a Category 5 shit-show for Intel and their Enterprise/cloud customers.  Existing Intel x86 cloud infrastructure (a massive majority of the market) just depreciated by billions of dollars. 

The only thing keeping this from being the apocalypse for cloud businesses is that it is possible at all to work around the issue in software.  That is not a good situation.  They are fast-tracking the fix into the Linux Kernel faster than *anything* goes in, and at a *huge* performance cost.  Unheard of.  They are redacting comments from source code, and have Google/Amazon employees on CC with the team working on the fix in secret.  This isn’t unusual for embargoed zero-day bugs, but the whole thing reeks of panic.

Some people are trying to downplay the issue and other people are trying to sensationalize it. My best guess for when the dust settles is that normal server workloads wind up seeing a modest 3-10% performance penalty on average as a result of the ""fix,"" potentially a bit more for one off scenarios where something is harassing the kernel a lot for some reason (virtualized environments notably come to mind). That 30% number being thrown around was from a test designed to provoke the problem and is not really indicative of a typical workload. 

As an aside, it's important to note that not everyone is always using 100% cpu on their servers anyway, for a lot of use cases I'd go so far as to call anything close to 100% cpu utilization a serious issue that needs to be addressed immediately. I'd bet a lot of people have left themselves enough wiggle room for this not to cause a major headache.

the performance hit is dependent upon workload. current testing shows the effects to be 0-54% depending on workload, with an average worst-case hit between 5-31% depending on workload.

addressing meltdown: once appropriately patched + KPTI implemented the hit appears for most deployments to be sub 5%/negligible. and this is for server/virtualized performance.

for desktop users the effect is negligible.

spectre is a different story as there is currently no effect 'patch' against the attacks.

meltdown is heavily an intel issue, and will require a software patch to address.

spectre affects nearly all CPU design.

while this will hurt intel you will not likely see large DC's ripping and replacing intel for AMD. first, that would require a mobo change, second that requires a kernel rebuild/OS reinstallation in most cases... third, and this is the most important as others have touched on -- people build for a specific architecture, for testing, and for reliability. you MAY see amd be incorporated into the test bed at a higher rate, and small spin-ups of test builds... but, it wouldn't be instant, nor will be it a rip and replace.

in the long run i believe this will HELP intel. this will require a redesign of the hardware, and a rethink as to how speculative execution is handled; but, once addressed this will almost certainly mean that large providers will upgrade chips.

will this help AMD... probably. will this remove intel from the throne... unlikely.

intel will take a hit in the short term, intel will have to rethink their next-gen CPUs as will EVERY mfg (to address spectre, minimaly)... but, that's the value-add.

ps -- you really have no idea what you're talking about. and if you are saying you work in software engineering, and don't understand the complexity of switching CPU's... i wouldn't hire you. it has little to do with the software design, and everything to do with systems design, performance, and reliability.",zuggles,wallstreetbets,21.0

If you know what the words they pump out actually mean and how the whole response is psychologically made to have subtle hits to plausible industry wide fault instead of just them being the outlier - you’d see Intel as the greedy fucks they are. Not only in screwing their consumers when AMD was out of the picture since no competition - but also the clear inside trading by their CEO to maximize value and keep loss to a minimum depth. Why the NDA? Why the hesitation to admit AMD isn’t as affected as they are? 

Also - why is the market after news this massive barley denting Intel ( 8 billion loss is nothing to them but a speed bump ) and tanking AMD? I and many others probably know why - it’s not about the books at the moment because right now if you go on eBay currently an influx of US database servers are up for sale all relating in intel. They don’t even want patches. AMD has barley a scratch and Intel has the balls to tie them with their architectural fuck up unrelated to AMD’s. Also - with AMD Server hardware offering full performance and HALF the cost - what do you think database management will order? I know it’s all currently a shit show and how Intel should recover in market price - but I’m talking about the imprint it made with their revenue stream.

Who does this, and why?

AMD and Intel CPUs have the same instruction set architectures (ISA). Their CPUs may use different internal reduced (micro) instruction set, but externally they abide by x86 standards. This of course means they can differ in their performance characteristics. It's the job of the VM or compiler to optimize performance for various architectures, and most software engineers do not work on compilers or VMs. Almost no one hand-writes x86 assembly anymore because compilers and VMs tend to be really damn good at what they do.

In most cases switching from Intel to AMD (or vise-versa) CPUs is as hard as physically switching CPUs; the software ""just works"". Is it this simple in a datacenter environment? I highly doubt it, but it could be the least bad choice.",glbeaty,wallstreetbets,42.0

Stocks go up and down in price. Let's say you buy a stock. Let's go with a meme stock. AMD. You buy 1 AMD stock. It costs you $10.00. Let's say AMD announces a new super leet processor core and people want in on the profit of AMD. What happens is there are more people buying AMD than selling. So demand raises. AMD stock price rises with demand. After a while your stock might be worth $11.00. You decide to sell. You have just made $1.00.

On the other hand. Let's say everyone says ""I hate technology"". And they want to play with sticks and hoops again like the 1930's. Well more people will be selling than buying. So demand will decrease. Your stock might go down to $9.00. In which you can sell if you want. However, you still own the stock. So if you sold you would lose $1.00.

You can hold the stock for as long as you want. You decide when to sell.

Table 1:


First:

Table 2: 

Look at the column P&gt;!t!

Notice that the const row has a p greater than 0.05. Just completely ignore that row.

Now look at the X1 row in table 2, it's got a significant P value (It's less than 0.05). 

In this output each variable you add is called X1, X2, X3 etc. 

So if I had run the command as follows (AAPL, SPY, AMD, MU)
I would be looking at the impact of SPY, AMD, and MU on AAPL.
So table 2 would have the rows: Const, X1, X2, X3

Where X1 is SPY, X2 is AMD etc. 

The coef column tells you a change of 1 in SPY results in how much of a change in AAPL. 

So in this case, when the market goes up by 1, we would expect apple to go up by 1.17, and when the market goes down by 1 we would expect AAPL to go down by 1.17.

6,2018-05-01,"* I opened a Robinhood account  
Robinhood is a free App for Android and iOS that allows you to trade on the stock market for free.  Its pretty much a discount brokerage that allows for people to either buy stocks and ETFs responsibly and cheaply or lose their ass gambling when they have no business doing so... as you can probably guess, people on WSB are more towards the latter than the former.

* I even fucks wit margin sometimes  
Margin is a loan that a brokerage offers you on your account.  The loan is paid for monthly until you cancel.  By default Robinhood gives you an automatic loan for free when you sign up called Robinhood Instant.  Instant allows you to use cash immediately when you initiate a transfer from your bank instead of waiting for the money to clear.  There is also an additional loan that you can get based off of the total money in your account called Robinhood Gold.  Robinhood Gold is the margin referred to here.

* I wanted to tell you that I also got approved for options  
Options are contracts between a buyer and a seller that gives you the ""option"" to buy a stock at a set price.  So say a stock is worth $50 today.  You can pay the owner of the stock $1 and say ""I will buy this stock from you for $50 in a week, but during that time you cannot sell it to anyone else"".   The $1 is the price for reserving your right to buy that stock at $50.  Of course in a week the stock can either rise in price, $55 for example or go down in price, $45 for example.  Money is made and lost based on the movement in the stock price.

* I buy OTM calls right before earnings reports  
Buying ""Out of the Money"" calls is a term for options.  Calls are options where you assume the price will go up.  Puts are options where you assume the price will go down.  Going back to my $50 stock example from before, if $50 is the current price and the option costs $1 for a $50 call, that is an ATM or ""At the Money"" option.   Buying a $0.50 call with a $60 strike price would be an ""Out of the Money"" option.  Because the stock is at $50 buying a call for $60 is cheaper than buying a call for $50. since the stock has to move a significant amount to make up for the difference in price.  There is one other option called an ITM or ""In the Money"" option.  Where you would pay $6 for a $45 strike price.  Since the stock is a $50 a $45 strike is generally made up of the price difference between the current price and the strike price (50-45 = 5) + a premium.  In this case my premium is $1.  Which is why the ITM call costs $6 while the ATM call is $1 and the OTM call is $0.50.  OTM calls have the greatest movement in terms of price fluctuation so they have the greatest chance to make money, but they also have the greatest chance of going to zero meaning you lose all of your money.

* They asked if I wanted options. I did.  
Options are not available by default on any brokerage that I know of because the chance your money goes to zero is much greater.  For a stock to go to $0 the copmpany generally has to go out of business.  Options go to $0 on thier expiration date if their strike price is not meet.  Because of this you have to request options trading from your brokerage.  Most brokerages will require you to take a course and fill out a form stating why you want options.  Robinhood just allows you to click a button, so yeah... lots of people who have no idea what an option is got access to options.  

* been loading up on AMD faggies for like 2 weeks now   
Faggies or FD are a WSB term for options that expire in one week or less.  The longer it is that an option exists the more chance it has to make money.  However the shorter the timeframe the greater the price movement.  So while an option that expires next year has a good chance to make money, it may only make 10~15% while a weekly option has a chance to make 300%.  People on WSB ""bet"" on the weekly options to try and hit the jackpot or go broke. ""why make 10% when you can lose 100%"" or in the case of margin lose 200% and go into debt to the brokerage.

* Intel puts out my ass too  
I explained calls a bit above.  Puts are the other type of option.  You put stocks in the option holders account for a specific amount.  Going back to the $50 stock, a put for $60 would be ITM while a put for $40 out be OTM.  Because you put a stock in their account for $60 while the stock is worth $50, the $10 difference is your profit.  If the stock drops lower, your profit increases.  Again, just like with calls, the OTM puts have a much greater price movement and have a greater chance to go to zero.  

* On the part of the application where they asked how often you trade options  
Yeah, as mentioned before, Robinhood doesn't have much of an application process.  If you say ""I want options"" they'll give them to you.  However they are random as to when they will finally assign the options to your account.  Applications are for real brokers like Schwab and TDA, but for the meme it works either way as most traders understand that you have to ask to receive options.

* they asked me the question i said... every day  
Because options are so volatile you normally don't use them that frequently.  If you are trading options everday you are probably a degenerate gambler and not an investor.  Options were originally made to protect the stocks you owned.  Now people use them for betting on price movement without owning the stocks in question.

11,2018-05-01,"&gt; ""I opened a Robinhood account.""

Robinhood is a brokerage that doesn't charge any fees, even to make buys. Paying $5-10 a trade isn't a big deal when you're trading a bunch of money but if you're a broke bitch and therefore the idea of buying more than a few grand of stock is ""scary"" to you then you use Robinhood. 

&gt; ""I even fucks wit margin sometimes.""

Borrowing to buy stock. This isn't because you're broke - it's just extra risky. Why invest $10,000 when you can borrow $10,000 and double your exposure to The Gains? But if you lose your own money in the stock market then the money is gone - but at least you don't OWE anyone money. It's very easy to end up owing money to your broker when you trade on margin. 

&gt; ""I wanted to tell you I also got approved for options.""

Option calls give you the ""right"" to buy a stock at a set price. This is very different than a typical investment in the actual stock. When you own stock you typically ride the wave of earnings and news - little ticks up and down in relation to the news. With an option you can be ""out of the money"" - which means the right to buy the stock at the set price is worthless. This happens when the stock is worth less than the ""set price"" I outlined above. 

The value of having the right to buy a stock at a certain price is ZERO when the stock is below that price. 

This means it's a unique investment because you can invest relatively little to buy these rights, but they can be solid profit later (Buy the right for $1, and then the stock price is $1 above the ""set price"" means you just doubled your money) but they also easily become worthless. 

&gt; ""I buy OTM calls.""

Buying an option call that is currently worthless, basically. You're just hoping some news comes out that improves the company, so you can make money. An OTM call is typically very cheap for this reason - so you're hoping to make a lot on your investment....or you just more likely than not lose everything. 

&gt; ""Right before earnings reports..""

Basically saying ""There is minimal time for this investment to go well..."". Your OTM investment is likely sitting at near worthless so you're definitely saying YOLO with this investment. 

&gt; ""Been loading on AMD faggies for like 2 weeks now.""

AMD is a stock that people have been meme'ing about. I dunno wtf ""faggie"" 

&gt; ""Intel puts out my ass too.""

A put/call are different types of options. A call is what I said above, a put is the right to sell an stock at a set price. They're just opposites of each other. One you make money if the stock goes down, the other if it goes up. It doesn't matter. The point is that this person is buying a lot of options because fuck it. They're also betting AMD and Intel go opposite directions.

This is a way of doubling down on a certain bet. If your bet is ""AMD grows, which means Intel does poorly"" then you can not only buy AMD calls, but Intel puts, to bet on both sides of that line of thinking. If that turns out to be wrong then TWO of your investments are total fuck-ups. But if it's right, two of your investments are winners. 

&gt; ""On the part of the application where they ask you how often you trade options - they asked me the question - I said the answer is every day.""

The joke here is that some little kid is saying that, so he probably doesn't trade options everyday and probably barely knows what the fuck he's getting into. But he's gonna go ahead and lie about that because he obviously deserves to trade options everyday. He's just trying to get a yacht before he's an old man at the age of 23.

Robinhood is a financial services company for poor people that does not charge account management or per-trade fees like most other brokerages.

""I even fucks wit margin sometimes.""

""On margin"" refers to borrowing money from a broker to purchase stock or options, typically used for short-term investments for which you've done absolutley no due diligence research.

""Cole, that's very wrong.""

Buying on margin is like fucking your sister.  It's all fun and games until you get called, and she tells you she's pregnant.

""You're borderline retarded, you know that..""

Indeed.

""I wanted to tell you I also got approved for options.""

A stock option is a financial derivitive that gives the buyer the - option - to buy or sell a stock at a certain price within a certain time period.  There's a lot of math involved that you absolutely shouldn't bother with.  Just use your heart and penis (never your brain) to take a good guess as to when your favorite stock will go up or down, and click that buy button.

""I buy OTM calls.""

""Out of the money"" calls are options with a strike price above current market price.  Some people (metrosexual robots) say they have no intrinsic value.  The way, way further out of the money they are the richer you'll get, especially if they expire same-day.  There's very little chance of being fucked in the ass with a 36in purple, spiked dildo I like to call Buffett's Revenge.

""Right before earnings reports..""

The weeks and days leading up to a company's earnings report are usually a very volitile time for the stock as people begin to take positions both short and long based on whether they think the company will exceed or fall short of analyst expectations.  Buying an OTM call at this time is nothing short of genius.  Like Kanye or Trump.  This is where kings are made.  And paupers.  Lots and lots of dick-sucking paupers.

""Been loading on AMD faggies for like 2 weeks now.""

AMD is a stock you should definitely buy if you want to make money super fast.  Just grab some shares or options for a day or two and you'll have a yacht in no time.  There's absolutely no chance you'll end up holding and loving it 'til you're 70 like Ed Sheeran.

Faggies, or faggots delight, are those OTM calls we talked about earlier, queer.  (They'll fuck you in the ass.)

""Intel puts out my ass too.""

The opposite of a call.  Goddamn what do you people want from me?

""On the part of the application where they ask you how often you trade options - they asked me the question - I said the answer is every day.""

I've talked to some sell-side analysts about them as well and we actually see AMD having a better chance at picking up market share from Intel than they do Nvidia, especially when Intel is sort of fumbling 10nm so bad right now. I do like the idea of a hybrid mid range chip for gaming, I think that could be a good product for them. To me, just by the dips on Nvidia instead. ",LouisHillberry,wallstreetbets,43.0

1.  With options regardless of how much money you have, 1million bucks can just as easily go to $0 as $1,000; Like instantly.  Don't forget that.  It's not stock, don't treat it as such and thus keep positions small.

2.  Time is against you as they lose money each day and the tendency is for humans to pick OTM short term 1week, 1 month and 3 month options.  These are all tricks.

3.  Stay with deep in the money options.  Only allow OTM or ATM options if you have long time horizons like 9 months or 1 yr leaps.  And even then don't chase the cheapo lottos, they lose 99% of the time.

4.  Avoid options around earnings events.  The wallstreet MMs know this game and the options are already pricing in big moves so most of the time both the call and put buyers lose most or all their money EVEN WHEN THE STOCK MOVED strongly in their direction.

6,2018-05-12,"My point was that no one uses variance as a metric, because its expressed in units squared. You can't compare variances across stocks and expect to get meaningful results. That's why you take the square root of it to get standard deviation, which is the same units as the original inputs.

If I'm being 100% honest, I personally don't find any of this information useful. Then again, I'm probably not your target demographic.

This isn't intended to be condescending, just constructive criticism; which if you're looking to make some real fuckin' dollars, is all you need:

- It's not clear exactly what the strategy is here, other than providing a menu of dumpsters to burn your cash in. Cheap options does not automatically translate into good YOLO opportunities. Even making this kind of filter is really meaningless. I can buy or sell spreads with much better risk/reward ratios or much higher YOLO potential than single options.

-  Even if you realize it or not, you're sorting the filtered results by implied volatility. Lower % change to breakeven = lower implied vol, because that's literally the definition of it. So finding the cheapest options, both in dollar terms and implied vol terms, isn't a great strategy. They're cheap for a reason. Because you lose 99.999% of the time on them.

- If you truly want good YOLOs, filter out deltas above 0.6 and below -0.6. Buying deep ITM options is dumb. The reason those are cheap are because there's basically no money to be made anymore, other than the person on the opposite side of that trade watching your money vanish.

Good YOLOs come from picking severely mispriced stocks, then finding a good balance between the price of the option and the gamma you get to ride on the way up/down. I don't think your filter is capturing any of that. If you need an example, I'm currently laughing my ass off at the 2020 AMD $17 LEAP call option. I am almost 100% confident that none of these faggots have that kind of patience.

So yeah, make what you will about AMD's current fundamentals from a financial perspective \- but they've got a decent product this time around and partners backing it.

20,2018-06-01,"Management is super conservative with their guidance. It will also depend on Intel's competitiveness with their next generation of CPUs. But all indications point to severely delayed 10nm node for Intel. While AMD's 7nm node is on track from both TSMC and GlobalFundries (beginning of 2019).

Also this is the first time AMD is going to fab their CPUs on both TSMC and GlobalFundries (all current Ryzen CPUs are Global Foundries).

Now consider this. Zen2 is a first ever iteration on the very competitive Zen architectures, and the lead architect Mike Clark has already hinted at some obvious improvements they had to table in order to meet the Zen1 deadline. In other words architecturally and IPC speaking Zen2 should pack some serious uplift in terms of IPC.

If Zen is competitive today, with the inferior process (Global Foundries 14nm process Zen products are built on today is not as good as Intel's 14nm process). How competitive will Zen2 be with architectural improvements and a superior process?

And then finally a piece of news that came out recently:

When asked the CFO of GlobalFundries how he felt about AMD taping TSMC for the first time for their performance CPUs. GloFo's CFO had this to say:

&gt; [AMD] will have more demand than we have capacity, so I have no issues with that

Source: https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?_mc=RSS_EET_EDT&amp;doc_id=1333326&amp;page_number=2

So to recap:

- Zen2 should have a significant IPC uplift over current Zen.. which is already 98% of the way competitive to Intel. Due to low hanging fruit optimizations being that this is a brand new from scratch design. Whereas Intel has pretty much been squeezing all they can get out of their same architecture for a long time now. (in fact in light of some recent security issues on Intel chips which impact performance Intel is actually behind AMD).

- For the first time in the history, AMD will not only be on the same playing field, but potentially ahead of Intel, as far as the Fab process is concerned. This means leadership in perf/watt and leadership in performance.

- One of the fabs has pretty much confirmed that they think the volume will be insane. Not enough for one fab.

AMD already has superior server CPUs from Intel in terms of value per core and IO, and very similar performance in terms of perf/watt and IPC. Fast forward to 2019.. AMD should have superior server CPUs in every conceivable metric. Last time AMD was competitive they reached 45% consumer and 20% server market. Despite the fact that Intel used illegal rebates to keep AMD from OEMs (something they got convicted of both in US and EU). This time OEMs are jumping on board and this time AMD has a multigenerational roadmap designed to retain that marketshare. With a superior product 50% is very much achievable. 

Half of the server market alone is a $10B TAM and growing. The total TAM AMD can address for Servers, Laptops, Desktop and derivative products + GPUs is $70B.

Apple has dropped Intel from their future Macs as well.. there is an indication that their next CPU Kalamata might incorporate AMD via semi custom.

Intel has been caught sleeping. In semis it takes a long time to come up with an answer (took AMD 5 years). AMD has never been in a better position. The market hasn't even realized it yet.",whosbabo,wallstreetbets,20.0

I agree AMD was a bad investment.

At the moment however they are, again, improving margins and market share, whilst increasing revenue.

Reversing share dilution is a non-issue. I much prefer a non-bankrupt company to a bankrupt one. 

A pullback is possible but the opposite is also true. I doubt we have many shorts that entered above 14.20. Almost every short is atm losing money. And as you noted there are still probably 150 million shares short.

You are doing a bit of doublethink. You simultaneously claim AMD past performance is bad and that $43 million on $5 billion is bad. But compare that to one year before. You can't be blind to this increase. In your comment it seems there is nothing that can exonerate AMD from past mistakes. When looking at stock prices which are inherently about the expected future value of a company you seem a bit dug in. 

Anyways, best of luck to you. With a 50% run in a month a pull back might happen. But there are also some news that could send this stock soaring even higher.

I care about financials, and AMD has done a stunning turn around. Ramping products, re-entering old markets and returning to old. At the same time growing both revenue, margins, returning to profit.

The future products are the huge potential upside, but AMD is selling products right now, this quarter, last quarter and making a profit. Ignoring that trend to focus on the incredibly horrible time that was bulldozer (a failure that compounded with the wafer agreement) is just not wise.

$.60 eps is reachable this year, and that puts AMD at expensive but not fantasyfutureland expensive.

But yeah, AMD financials sucked major ass a long while and wafer agreement, bulldozer and subsequent debt almost sank them. But they pulled through, and their products are competitive and selling *right now*. 

An example, posted today by one of the most respectable tech sites anandtech. https://www.anandtech.com/show/12814/a-thought-on-silicon-design-intels-lcc-on-hedt-is-dead

""Based on our Ryzen 2000-series review, it was clear that Intel’s 8-core Skylake-X product is not up to task. The Core i7-7820X wins in memory bandwidth limited tests because of the fact that it is quad channel over the dual channel competition, but it falls behind in almost every other test and it costs almost double compared to the other chips in benchmarks where the results are equal. It also only has 28 PCIe lanes, rather than the 40 that this chip used to have two generations ago, or 60 that AMD puts on its HEDT Threadripper processors.""

That is the reality TODAY. Intels products are overpriced and objectively worse at many use cases. (I tried to find source for this) I thought I read intel warning for slightly lower datacenter margin in q1 Q&amp;A. 

Thing is, intel cant keep their 99.5% share and margin at the same time now that AMD is launching a competitive product again. What do you think they will choose, lower market share or margin?

On top of that something which isn't even priced in - the possibility of even further 10 nm production woes.

150,2018-06-06,"I commented in some of the other threads, but since you seem to be asking a serious question.  
  
AMD used the same architecture and increased both the cores &amp; threads in the Ryzen chip. That means you can keep the same motherboard, update your BIOS, and then potentially double your core/thread usage.  For some fucking reason the PC community has started referring to architecture as an ""ecosystem"", but that's beside the point.  
  
This is 100% a fantastic thing to do, except in typical AMD fashion, they are (in my opinion) late to the game.  The only people this will have a huge affect on are people that do homebrew/small batch graphics and rendering.  I say small batch because the big boys with big boy money to throw around will just simply purchase either larger processing centers or motherboards that utilize multiple CPUs.    
  
AMD showed a great comparison vs an Intel chip using Blender 3D software.  AMD definitely beat the competition, however, not that many professionals use Blender.  I'd be much more interested to see a comparison on multiple renders from multiple software platforms.  Same with CAD, I'd be really interested to see a comparison on mega CAD files from Autodesk.
  
Permit me a car analogy:  
  
In an attempt to increase market share, a manufacturer takes an established product line and drastically revamps the interior &amp; media interface.  They add turntables, a mobile mixing booth in the front passenger seat, wi-fi on the car for everyone to connect to, some gay top end sound system with 2 14"" subs, and flashing lights for the interior mood lighting.  The car still gets 20 MPG &amp; has a 150 HP engine.

My turnaround was when I yolo all my money on snap when it was 11.70 for a $12 call. Had a nice 50% return.

Personally I will only do *FD* type trades on QQQ or SPY unless I have reason to believe the stock I’m *betting* on is expected to have some sort of quick/large change.  For AMD people have been expecting a drop for weeks now just because it’s been on a run lately and a pullback of a few percent wouldn’t be out of the question, even if AMD is on its way to $20 in a few months which it very well might be.  That said if you really believe in something, buy some options a few months out that aren’t too expensive, that way a sizable drop in the interim won’t wreck you.

3,2018-06-09,"Just looked through both companies 10-Q

Intel revenue: 16.1B up from 14.8B

16.1B is broken down into 4 business groups:
1. Consumer grade 8.2B up from 8B (50%) of rev
2. Data center 5.2B up from 4.2B 
3. Internet of things 0.8B up from 0.7B
4. Memory 1B up from 0.9B
5. Programmable solutions 0.5B up from 0.4B

AMD revenue: 1.65B up from 1.18B

AMD revenue is only split into two groups:
1. Computing and graphics 1.12B up from 0.57B (from 50% to 68%)
2. Enterprise 0.53B down from 605B

I really wish AMD would report their cpu and gpu revenues separately, if anyone has those figures this autist would be very appreciative.

Key takeaways for me:
8.2 from 8.0 yoy over same period is basically no growth at all for intel consumer grade, meanwhile AMD jumped 50%.

AMD sucks at enterprise, we’ll have to wait and see how much of this epyc adoption actually takes place.

Intel has more business units and is more diversified. Intel also has 10x revenue of AMD.

In the current cycle of product development, AMD has caught intel with its pants down. Whether consumers notice it or not is anyone’s guess. But I think ultimately the superior product wins (like Apple vs Microsoft in the vista era), but this change in paradigm be a long term shift (over several years) and takes the assumption Intel continues their status quo behavior and does not innovate.

I think there is enough room in the market for both companies to grow (especially in the non-consumer area), although AMD has more potential if they get their execution right.

Edit: people seem to think I believe AMD stock can go to 40 by next year. The way I wrote that wasn’t very clear.

25% of Americans dont have access to broadband - https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/01/a-quarter-of-urban-americans-dont-have-broadband-access-here-s-why/

So amazon netflix booking.com Shopify etc etc anything with online retail will have a lot of room for growth at a glance.

But would you buy into these stocks?

I bought into Amazon in the 800’s and some folks not here but other places were saying it’s overpriced. Maybe it was. Maybe it is. But it’s what 1600+ in a year or so. Incredible.

So are they overvalued. Maybe. Have they got room to grow. Yes.

I sold my Netflix i think at 250 and bought in I think 180. For me it starts to feel overpriced now because it’s hemorrhaging money. They spend billions on content and who knows when they will profit.  in a recession subscription services are first to go. That $15 a month. Gone. 

AMD makes GPUS AND CPU so it’s like nvidia and intel combined by is AMDS market cap in the toilet when Nvidias is so high. I have no idea but I knew it was underpriced so when it ran under 10 I scooped it up and honestly I think this will run and run soon enough. The world is going to need more CPU’s and GPUS.

The world is gonna need more ram more batteries more OLED screens when VR kicks in. 

Apple are 1000000% going to launch some sort of glasses. Perhaps oct 2019. So I’m going to get back on that train when their stock possibly dips due to slowing phone sales.

So you will be stuck getting exercised at $30 and you make 56% instead of 100% or 500% like the person who buys your calls will make. I.E. you cucked yourself

27,2018-06-09,"I am in the same boat. I’ll be 30 in a few years and I am a full time employee and a full time student. The best thing to do is save up a few hundred dollars and try out a few options at a time to get a feel for the market. You will 98% chance loose it all if you are doing it correctly. This may sound weird but it’s good to loose at first in order to learn the valuable lessons necessary to prevent yourself from going bankrupt. After doing this for 2 months, you should have a decent grasp over the language of this sub and how to better understand the tips that the people in this sub give. Once you feel confident in your abilities (after loosing a few hundred dollars) add 500$ from your credit card into you debit card and then place that in your RH account. Wait for a popular stock like Tesla or Netflix to take a minor dip and then buy into the dip giving yourself between 7-14 days out for your call option to fulfill. If you buy into the dip you may be able to afford 2 contracts but most likely you will only afford one. (It will be about 350$). Be sure to buy it slightly OTM like within 5-10 dollars of the current stock price during the dip. Take the other cash and throw it at AMD or iQ or MU or whatever the theme of this sub is at the time. Don’t loon at your phone until 9:25 the next morning (5 min before market opens) and sell for your first tendies. Once you sell you can either use your profit and pay off your cc debt or find a stock you like and study the shit out of it before Yolo-ing it. 

People who make the most money don’t gamble with pennies and are prepared to loose it all. 

If you want a small steady income then bet small amounts per week and take your tendies as they come. Be sure to keep a day trader slot open for those stocks who go south quickly because you may need to dump them rather quickly and just take the loss up front.

Chances are their new architecture even resolves the bit of the chip flaws they were exposed to, while Intel's delay is no doubt because they have to completely redesign their architecture from the ground up to get around spectre+meltdown.  To top it off, they just pulled some PR stunt with a 5GHz 28-core CPU as a demo pretending it was the next in line for release, but it was one of their lower quality chips overclocked to shit with a 1 HP industrial water cooler strapped on the thing to keep it from catching fire.

39,2018-06-11,"1. Fundamentals

Without going into too much detail, Applied Materials is just a solid company. In the notoriously cyclical semiconductor industry, Applied has posted steady increases in revenue and EPS over the last five years, just about every quarter. The only times that revenue and EPS were flat (Q2\-Q3 2013, Q2\-Q3 2014, Q1 2017), it rebounded with strong growth immediately. The last five quarters (since Q1 2017), the growth has been especially strong. It has the most diverse offering of the semiconductor supply companies, making it more resilient to individual trends. And its customer service business is growing steadily, making up for the intermittent declines in equipment demand. It consistently beats its own guidance. In fact, it has met or exceeded its guidance in each of the last 22 quarters for adjusted EPS. I didn’t even stop at 22 because it didn’t meet expectations before that; I just stopped researching. This company has grown in all business climates. It has good cash flow, low debt, and shows no signs of stopping.

2.  Tech = Good

We all know tech is here to stay. We know this is just the beginning. When Intel’s CEO talked about data being the new oil, and when Applied’s CEO talked about the technological revolution being fueled by semiconductors in the same way the industrial revolution was fueled by oil, they know what they are talking about. It’s not hype. And while MU, AMD, INTC, NVDA, and all the other chip producers and tech suppliers are innovating, they need new equipment and fabs. They need more, faster. And their demand will fuel AMAT. The sky is the limit in tech, and Applied is definitely along for the ride.

3.  AMAT’s leadership and institutional investors believe in the company.

Before MU made it cool, AMAT was buying back shares at a blistering pace. In the last 3 years, AMAT has bought back 230 million shares. As in, close to 25&amp;#37; of its current share total. It still has billions of dollars left on its share repurchase authorization and they are jumping on this opportunity to buy shares cheaply. Since its last earnings report, AMAT has bought back 40 million shares, or about $2 billion worth. Oh, and on top of that, it just doubled its dividend in February. No big deal. And institutions own over 80&amp;#37; of AMAT’s stock. That’s on the high end (AMZN: 58&amp;#37;, NVDA: 66&amp;#37;, APPL: 61&amp;#37;, FB: 74&amp;#37;, MU: 79&amp;#37;). There is lots of faith among the people who know what they are doing.

4.  MU earnings as catalyst.

We all love MU here, and I don’t think it’s a bad idea to stay in MU. But if you want to play MU earnings without suffering the sell\-off and IV crush, AMAT is your play. Twice out of the last four earnings reports, MU has literally stopped an AMAT drop and sent it flying. Just look at the AMAT 1\-year chart and note 6/29/17 and 9/26/17. Before 6/29, AMAT dropped about 8&amp;#37;. Then, after MU reported earnings, AMAT went up 14&amp;#37; over the next few weeks. Before 9/26, AMAT dropped about 5&amp;#37;. Then, after MU reported earnings, AMAT went up 22&amp;#37; in less than a month. This is because as MU succeeds, it raises its capital expenditures. And that it good news for its equipment suppliers. And bigger than that, MU has an off\-cycle earnings date, so it’s our first look at the industry heading into Q3 (AVGO has a very different business model). So if you’re bullish on MU, consider hopping aboard.

5.  We don’t know when the trade war will resolve.

Admittedly, AMAT is sensitive to trade war tensions with China. We don’t know what’s going to happen with that. It might take years. It might take months. Maybe they’ll figure it out soon. I don’t know. What I do know is that when they do figure it out, and come to some deal, all the pressure that pushed AMAT down 10&amp;#37; will lift and it will immediately jump. I want to be there for that. And in the meantime, I’ll take the minor swings of bad news and good news.

26,2018-06-12,"&gt; I disagree. First, DIY and the laptop market in general is a dying animal and is not why Intel stock has rallied in the last year. It’s all about the data center and there I think name brand matters a lot. 

I work in this industry. Datacenter doesn't care about the brand in the least. Particularly hyperscale Super 8 cloud providers. Perhaps you aren't going to convince an enterprise customer to switch to AMD.. but enterprise customers almost don't even matter to AMD. Hyper-scale cloud it's where it's at, because that's where the major expansion is happening. AMD can offer 2-3 times more IO, and similar performance for half the price. Zen2 on 7nm will offer all that, plus more performance and about 30% better perf/watt.. which is the #1 thing datacenter cares about.

The original Opteron captured 25% of the market, and it was a flash in the pan type product, before cloud even existed. Zen has a multi-generational roadmap. 

&gt; As one piece of evidence, the market barely reacted when Apple reported they were moving away from Intel starting 2019.

Apple's entire contract is worth about $1.5B in revenue to Intel. It's a nice chunk but not a game changer.

&gt; How do you sell cloud servers to enterprise customers? 

You are not selling them servers. You are selling them cloud services or virtualized instances.. the customer doesn't get access to the bare metal. That's the whole thing with cloud. The customer doesn't want to even think about bare metal. When you as an enterprise customer go to Microsoft Azure for a Hadoop cluster, you are not told what hardware it runs on, because it's not your job to care about those SLAs, it's Microsoft's job. That's the selling point. And Azure has already started adopting Epyc in their datacenters.

Reddit for instance runs on Amazon's AWS. Reddit wouldn't even know when Amazon migrates their instances to Epyc. What do they care? as long as the service is up?

Also even if they do care, these people are informed. They know that Epyc is based on Zen, which is arguably the best CPU architecture on the market. And AMD has already announcement engagement with all the major cloud providers. So this is already old news.",whosbabo,wallstreetbets,26.0

I can’t get max pain historical data, I’m assuming I could if I wanted to pay, but for the stocks I have tracked it, for limited time (AMD, AAPL) I don’t think it’s right even 50% of the time.  For instance max pain for AMD this Friday is $12.

Max pain for MU last Friday was $54, and yet it ended at $61.

Part of the flaw in the logic is that people selling puts and calls aren’t exactly losing money if they get assigned.  Sure it might not be their preference, but having to lose 100 shares in the case of a covered call isn’t awful as long as you had some gain in the underlying, and getting 100 shares from a sold put isn’t awful assuming the shares don’t then plummet to zero, and no matter what they already got their premium either way.",Gahvynn,wallstreetbets,76.0

This is going to be hugely important in the mobile space where Qualcomm and AMD have gone back to tmsc for there more reliable 7nm production which I'm going to say is ahead of the competition. Even high-end MediaTek chips are going 7nm with TSMC and it looks like Apple will be going with them as well. This post was targeting the general cpu market not just desktop and I think that makes the chip size a valid point to buy TSM",bandwagonnetsfan,wallstreetbets,22.0
23,2018-07-09,"The question is really just whether or not the market share that AMD takes will effect Intel's bottom line. You may be right about TSMC, and they're not really the direct competitor to Intel anyway since TSMC is just a foundry. I do think TSMC has a lot of tailwinds going for them right now, but my argument was mainly that people use node-naming as an argument for semi-conductor superiority (which is mostly nonsense) and then use that to formulate an argument for company success or failure (which doesn't have everything to do with chip performance), and that it's ultimately not very good DD for the reasons explained above.

TSM will go up because they're a foundry with a lot of big customers, and the demand for product from those customers is increasing, because the demand for silicon is increasing globally. That's really the only DD that is needed for a company like TSM.

INTC will go up for similar reasons, but it will also be effected be much more effected by whether or not it's rapid shift from PC-centric to Data-centric will play out and they'll be able to gain new customers in markets they have yet to tap. That's the growth opportunity that, IMO, everyone is missing with Intel. The 10nm vs 7nm vs 5nm arguments are all red-herrings. ",straightCrimpin,wallstreetbets,23.0

Basically their semi-custom business (making xbox ones and PS4s) was keeping them solvent while their compute division floundered on Bulldozer Mk LCXIV and R9 300 cards which were rebadged R9 200 cards which were rebadged HD 7000 cards... 

In 4 short years she righted the ship, largely by having AMD advance their technology. I don't know all the details but 2 years later Polaris launched and they reclaimed the mid-tier GPU market. The next year Zen launched and for the first time in...oh 10 year an all AMD computer is a competitive powerhouse build instead of being a joke.

AMD has always been a technology leader...more than their more profitable peers. Hell they introduced:

* multicore CPUs 
* 64 bit processors
* GDDR5 
* HBM
* Multi-die CPUs

The first three happened before 2010. The last 2 happened under Su Bae. She turned AMD back into what it was when they were trading blows with Intel and Su's Uncle Jensen at Nvidia at the same time: an innovation powerhouse.

Now we have Threadripper 2 promising 32c/64t on the desktop and Intel ***fucking panicking*** as they canabalize $10k server CPUs to compete...if your willing to use an industrial water chiller.

Evaluate the company and if you have a strong conviction that it's a good buy determine what price per share you're willing to pay for it. Put a notification in place for when it hits that price point and enter into the position. Don't go all in as you will want to have cash available if the stock goes lower so you can lower your cost basis and increase the size of your position. I determined that I liked AMD at any price below 12 and over the course of the year built up my position. You have to pay attention to the company to make sure that the underlying investment thesis doesn't change significantly. If you give yourself a long enough time this will prove to be an effective way to build up a position in a company. Sometimes the market doesn't agree with you but that's okay. I've built up a position in LRCX over the year as I see anything below 200 as a good buy. It's currently trading within a percent of my cost basis however I still feel strongly about the company and I have the confidence to see the investment play out without panicking about what it's doing day to day.

What's happening is the Zuckening is spliting tech into social media and real tech. Mixing the two was simply stupid. Now its time to fix this because autist milenials think what Zuck does is the 'same' as what Intel, MS, and AMD do. NO ITS NOT. Stealing data from idiots and writing garbage php code is not real tech. This is like saying dating sites and banks are tech because they have apps.

Social media is a separate industry. Now the market will remind you of this reality the only way it knows how.

Need I remind you that this is: 
The same Intel that had to use an industrial cooler at [Computex](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-28-core-cpu-5ghz,37244.html) to prevent being completely outdone by AMD.

The same Intel responsible for a new i9 that runs so hot it [throttles within minutes](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-2018-macbook-pro-has-a-problem-with-overheating/).

The same Intel that is [struggling to get their 10nm](https://www.semiaccurate.com/2018/08/02/intel-guts-10nm-to-get-it-out-the-door/) product out the door in 2019 while AMD is sampling 7nm.

27,2018-08-08,"&gt; Those cluster all have to use the same CPU Manufacturer. You can't mix and match AMD and Intel. 

You should tell Dell about this immediately. VMware seems to work just fine (possibly give or take vmotion)  Windows guys are cute.

Since the introduction of the Generation 10 servers in 2007 Dell has adopted a standardized method for naming their servers; the name of each server is now represented by a letter followed by 3 digits. The letter indicates the type of server: R (for Rack-mountable) indicates a 19"" rack-mountable server, M (for Modular) indicates a blade server, whilst T (for Tower) indicates a stand-alone server.

This letter is then followed by 3 digits.

The first digit refers to the number of sockets in the system: 1 to 3 for one socket, 4 to 7 for two sockets, and 8 or 9 for four sockets.
The middle digit refers to the generation: 0 for Generation 10, 1 for Generation 11, and so on.
The third digit indicates the make of the CPU: 0 for Intel or 5 for AMD.

For example: The Dell PowerEdge M610 is a two-socket server of the 11th generation using an Intel CPU whilst the R605 is a two-socket AMD-based rack-server",StockDealer,wallstreetbets,27.0
28,2018-08-08,"AMD is not going to chew into Intel's share of the Datacenter.

Datacenters are all virtualized. A bunch of physical servers make up a Cluster where virtual machines live. 

Those cluster all have to use the same CPU Manufacturer. You can't mix and match AMD and Intel. So to replace a physical host with AMD, you have to replace all the hosts in that cluster. Meaning a huge fork-lift upgrade of that cluster. IE: Not happening anytime soon because of the cost associated with it along with the manpower and work involved.

Typical refresh cycles in Cloud Datacenters involve replacing a handful of hosts here and there instead of doing all at once. With the addition of hyper converged storage (As in your Storage solution lives on those hosts) this furthers the gradual replacement of servers as opposed to fork-lift upgrades because you can add\replace storage without ever taking it down.

43,2018-08-09,"AMDs chips can have enormously high core counts because they glue together smaller chips on an interposer. This allows for more chips per wafer, less defected chips per wafer but causes a bit more latency between the cores. This makes it extremely cheap to make high core count chips which are needed for datacenters. Once AMD switches over to 7nm, the chips will be more power efficiënt, causing less heat and allows the chips to run at higher clock speeds. New nodes like the 7nm node always have a high defect rate compared to older more refined ones. AMD is able to make the 7nm chips with profit because they can glue the chips together. 

Intel keeps fucking up their 10nm node and is completely beaten by AMD. Its over for intel once AMD releases their 7nm chips.

Y'all gave me great advice last time such as ""take it out and pay it off before you regret it,"" ""sell your AMD it's gonna crash,"" ""Starbucks is a bad short"" and other goodies. Well, good for me I didn't listen to you. In fact, I made almost all of this explicitly ignoring WSB consensus (except for getting burned for a few k on MU earnings).

*All of these are positions are realized except for AMD and a bit of MTCH calls*

**Tree, should I go take out a loan and do this too?**

No, hell no. Please don't. I don't trust any of you. Taking out a loan won't magically make you a good trader. I had already practiced swing trading with success before taking out the loan, and still did not touch options until I had another full year of experience. Additionally, while the account was small, I was very careful with position sizing and hedging, as well as having backup cash in another account so *I was never at risk of a default*. In fact, before going on my run vertical, I was less than $1000 away from hitting the point where I planned to liquidate everything, pay off the loan, and take the loss. The stress ain't worth it. I got lucky. This ain't in the spirit of WSB but I'd rather see this sub filled with more +$400k guys and less -99% guys.

**Are you gonna pay off the rest of loan right now?**

No.

**What are my next plays?**

I don't have any ready and waiting in the wings. I'm probably gonna sell a lot and take a chill pill until something shows itself.

Competitor AMD might have good near term outlook, but after  7 nm release if they don't have portfolio diversification they won't have as good of future outlook due to the difficulty in going to 5nm. After 7 nm all that matters is innovation and securing spots in different markets. Since AMD is so behind in this regard I think Intel will win. AMD could grab up to 20% market share, but after that the aforementioned reasons like intel having custom solutions and already having such great ties with big players will be the reasons that Intel wins out.

48,2018-08-10,"You need it 2020, but not right now.  Intel will continue to sell like hotcakes. Lets remember Zen/Ryzen have been out for an entire year, which is an eternity in tech, and don't exactly have 50% of Intel's marketshare. Not to mention Zen/Ryzen is 14nm. AMD isn't selling 7nm right now and the market clearly doesn't give a shit about nm as much as price/performance/wattage. Sure 7 and 10nm will change that a bit, but not a lot, and not anytime soon. Datacenter orders from this year and last are still dominated by Intel, who also offers custom sillicon and enhancements to its big customers while AMD's more modest ""one size fits all"" isn't as appealing outside of the budget market.",Smallmammal,wallstreetbets,48.0
49,2018-08-10,"We will not see anything past 7 nm in probably a very long time, or at least we will not see it within the Moore dictated time frame. The next step is 5nm, and 5 nm cannot be accomplished without some sort of new technology due to the fact that once the transistors are that close the electrons carrying the current will experience quantum tunneling. These chips won't work properly because of this. A race to the smallest nm is no use because of this. This is why Intel's diversification in the market, hands on engineering that produces custom solutions that can't be easily replaced without large costs, and their already deep ties to big players will increase their valuation imo.  

\&amp;nbsp;  

edit; In addition to this, AMD has been chasing intel for the last 14 years. In all of that time they have always produced hotter and less energy efficient chips. Technically 7 nm should allow less heat output and more efficient energy use, but I will believe it when I see it. Intel has always been better when it comes to this, and in terms of data center market this is the most important. Slightly faster speeds will not be worth the investment if it costs you more in energy and cooling. ",Wisdoms_Son,wallstreetbets,49.0

51,2018-08-10,"Intel had their investor conference two days ago. They talked about so much diversification in their portfolio and how 10nm wasn’t a big worry because of everything they are doing. In addition to this they harped on how they do in person engineering with their clients to build semi custom and now fully custom architectures that best fit their needs. They said that their customers have seen 30% revenue increase because of this. Because they have custom solutions and Intel has their claws so deep into big players with AWS, Azure, Tencent, etc, I’m hard pressed to believe that 10nm should be the biggest focus. ESPECIALLY the day after a different analyst increased PT to 60.   
Also, when semis got hit hard yesterday(amd,MU,etc) Intel was green. This was due imo to the fact that investors had better confidence in their portfolio diversity. That’s my two cents anyway.

Second:

Third:

Thanks for pointing this out. I was trying to dispel the general myth that Spectre/Meltdown don't apply to AMD moreso than being as exhaustive as possible.   

&gt; It is possible to exploit execution of say a JavaScript engine in a browser (or some other plugin) to read protected memory on your [single tenant] machine remotely.  

Extremely interesting. Can you provide a source to more information on this? I recall reading, for example, [NetSpectre] (https://thehackernews.com/2018/07/netspectre-remote-spectre-attack.html) but the exfil rate was something like 4bytes per 8 hours or some other absurdly low number. NOT useless by any means, but not exactly an attack that a consumer needs to be wary of.

Sounds like you have a lot more experience than me. I know a good amount of x86 and am relatively familiar with Spectre/Meltdown, but not so much that I've actually gone off and tested PoC's or dove deep.  

Looking back, what kicked up your x86/reversing skills to ""the next level""? I'm talking the level beyond ""Guy who is pretty good and generally does alright in CTFs.""

Intel makes radios for iphones. AMD does not. 

&amp;#x200B;

AMD will get more market share. Intel's stock will continue to go down. But keep those in mind when setting price targets.

You needed to have way otm puts and way otm calls going for 3 months..   then you play the FD's in between, and try to also sell calls past the original otm calls i mentioned earlier.. and sell puts past the original otm puts I mentioned earlier.

Like this:

AMD:

buy $22 puts 2-3 months out.

buy $35 calls 3-4 months out.

sell/write  $38 calls need probably 3 months out

sell/write $18 puts need probably 3 months out.

then play atm straddle if you can - $25 Call/put Straddle.

then play Faggy D's while waiting the 1-3 months.. 

Also if you want, buy as many shares as you can and close them daily day trading the 20 cent - $1 jumps it does..

75,2018-09-04,"You can't sell CPUs, GPUs and Cloud without memory huh... Well for starters, the DRAM market is basically Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron at 46%, 29%, and 21% respectively and Micron is somewhat known to make sht DRAM (I mean they're okay but not as good as Samsung's).

Nvidia is exclusively using Samsungs GDDR6 for the Quadro RTX Cards (but the regular RTX line market is anyone's game).Amd uses Samsung HMB2 memory for their flagship Vega Cards and possibly SK Hynix HMB2 but I'm not quite sure after SK's whole HMB2 Fiasco before launch. Micron does not make HMB2 so they're out of the game here.

Amd CPU's are known to favor high clocked low latency RAM, and nothing beats good Samsung B-Die DDR4 (except maybe SK's B-Die). This is the consumer side; for the server side and Intel CPU's, I'm no expert. A quick check on Micron's website shows they don't even make 1600MHz DDR4 under CL22 which means you definitely won't be seeing Micron on the ""high-end"" stuff, however.As for Intel, you do realize that Intel is in the NAND Flash game as well right? Intel and Micron used to work together but broke up early Q1 this year... but they got back together and tbh idk whats with their relationship - it's complicated. Intel has been on top of things with their QLC, MLC, TLC, and XPoint (of which I'm sure Micron played a part in) and especially their Ruler series for datacenters. I'm not sure how involved Micron is with this, but seeing they're not in the news for any of this, either they're keeping their EDSFF solutions in tight wraps and media just isn't covering enough of it, or they're behind.

On the consumer side, Crucial storage isn't doing too bad, so Micron has that going for them. That being said, there's Seagate, WD/Sandisk, Toshiba, as well as Samsung, Intel, and SK to worry about here, and news flash: Crucial isn't the best.

For Microsoft, they announced their Project Denali industry standard in OCP early this year. [Do you see Micron in their partners slide?](https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/mediahandler/acomblog/media/Default/blog/4062da79-feb9-4b9e-b159-47f7c38a99cb.png)   


Yes, I'm missing a lot of info on many other companies (LiteOn and Elpida for example), but if this post's title is really your only reason for going in for MU, I think you'd be happier investing in some of the bigger names in Memory. P.S. I believe the only other time Apple hasn't used Samsung or SK for their ram in their modern phones was that one time Elpida showed up in the iPhone 6. As for storage, Toshiba, SK, and Sandisk for most of their devices including the macbooks.

&gt; we believe AMD will earn $1.06 (incl. SBC) in 2020 (up from our prior estimate of $0.89). In a more bullish scenario (implying higher share gains), we see AMD earning between $1.72 and $2.46

&gt;Our updated 12-month price target of $21 (from $13.25 prior) is based on 20x our normalized EPS estimate of $1.05

Hari has been pretty accurate with his eps estimate so far. I don't like buying AMD at this price and this far out from 7nm release. I like MU better at these prices.

The institutional folks don’t care what the price is, they just want to make maximum money on selling calls.

Others have said

The institutional folks want more shares, so they kick off panic selling, then retail investors that have weak hands and sell off at the slightest hint of bad news while the institutes accumulate.  Once they’re “happy” with the shares they have they will “let” prices adjust according to whatever the business case warrants.

The same argument was used for why AMD was so low earlier this year, with around 70% institutional ownership at the time.

I have no idea what’s true, but I could see hints of both, plus the simplest explanation that investors in general  aren’t convinced it’ll be different this time.

Their next big thing, their 10 nm process, keeps getting delayed. AMD is currently getting ready to start production with TSMC on a 7 nm production. Intel was completely blindsided by AMD, they did not see Ryzen being as big of a competitor as it actually was and you can tell by their initial response to the problem. Make a slightly better sku, take some Xeon features and slap it on a core series, ala the core i9. A completely impractical CPU for it's targeted market. Meanwhile, AMD is actually innovating. Their threadripper CPUs are bringing core counts to their heights, something extremely beneficial for workstations and actual productivity machines. While Intel has had a complete domination over the server marker, AMDs focus on core counts here is also making dents and as their epyc CPUs continue to gain prominence in servers. I will concede that all the takes for AMD is one major slip up to fall back in their distinct second place position while Intel can take a few hits, the future looks extremely bright for AMD.

Except AMD which you're ignoring.

One has risen to and maintained status as a blue chip company in an insanely competitive industry that gets turned upside down by innovation all the time. The other hits peaks every few years then slips back to being the product that poor people buy when on clearance. I see no reason why that will change this time around and no one is providing any.

They haven't been motivated for the last few years. No reason to rush when you have like 90% of the market and the closest thing you have to a competitor is a struggling AMD who had been making shitty chips that even their fanboys couldn't justify buying. Then AMD comes out with something good at a good price. Then Intel wakes up and after a while comes out with something better at 50% more money and most people buy it. Then AMD has to sell at rock bottom prices and struggles for a while. Then Intel loses all motivation and gets complacent because they're almost a monopoly. 

Then the cycle continues.

If memory is to even slightly decline, as rationally expected, mu will still maintain these levels of profits. The demand imo will increase with data center continued boom and av coming ever closer. Barring any terrible collapse, we can expect mu to at worst case, produce fcf of 10~b/yr. They will be able to buyback half of their shares in a few years. If mu is to at worst case scenario have no intrinsic growth and remain a 55~ bil company, the share value should increase 50% in 2 years.  

How insane is that...that this kind of company can have such a dog shit sentient by the market during such a strong bullish run. Regardless though, their share price will appreciate and I, along with many others, don't think memory is going to collapse. People expect peak margins and peak profits with strong decline from here, but that simply will not happen. Micron has improved their process saving billions. The market is different and samsung/sk are behaving differently, recently announcing holding off expansions. 

If the sentiment is to shift even slightly from dogshit to shit, they should come close to doubling in ~2 years. 

I almost want a recession to occur to bring mu down another 40%. It would be funny to see it trading at ~1-2 forward. Bullshit ass mf pressuring the stock, same shit happened with amd for almost a year.

129,2018-09-06,"The several times you laid out where AMD had the best product were in the same time span. The athlon 64 was the first to come out with the x64 instruction set, and is still known as amd64. AMD released the first consumer dual core in the athlon 64 x2. Those several times you laid out were in the same time span where AMD was on top. And like I said, a series of poor business decisions on AMD's part led them to go into decline. You're saying there's some sort of history with this, when in reality it was a singular event. The exact same thing could happen to Intel (I doubt it will, but it is far from out of the realm of possibility).

I don't think you understand just how much AMD has innovated in the CPU market now. Ryzen was not just AMD matching Intel, but surpassing in many aspects. They are primed to target the server with their Epyc CPUs with far better multicore performance than Intel. Epyc was only introduced in 2017 and hasn't had time to mature into the server market as Xeon's have had, but it will likely grow due to having overall better specs and, in most cases, better price to performance.

AMD is also currently killing it in workstations, another key market. Threadripper right now is one of the best CPU's, with 32 cores and 64 threads it absolutely dominates multithreaded workloads.

No, it hasn't been every few years a competitor gets the lead. Since the release of bulldozer CPUs back in like 2011, Intel has been the de facto leader in the CPU market. Even before then, AMD was not innovating as they had with their famous Athlon processors. Intel has had such an upper edge over AMD the past decade that they have began to stagnate. Their previous tick tock style, where every two years they would massively improve has dwindled to every now and then you'll see a worth while performance increase, whereas Ryzen 2 has shown significant increases in performance. Every single metric right now points to AMD becoming the major competitor it once was. 

Finally, I never claimed AMD was going to overthrow Intel and become top dog. I don't think AMD can do that in such a short time frame. However, they are most definitely showing they are no longer the third rate CPU manufacturer for everyone's first PC build with a good ole FX-6300, where everyone then moves up to some i5 or something. Intel will either have to pull something amazing out of their hat or truly work over multiple years to create something groundbreaking. The zen architecture took years to create, and is paying of for AMD. Intel can't continue to iterate over years, where you will finally see worthwhile performance increases after a few years in you CPU when AMD is showing significant performance improvements year after year. Intel is on the back foot, while AMD has the initiative. There is a reason AMD stock has been increasing so rapidly, while Intel is in a slow decline.",braden26,wallstreetbets,129.0

Consumer CPUs are only a fraction of the market and that's where AMD lives. AMD has been trying get into data centers forever. Remember Opteron? Those were awesome. Where did that get them? They got all the way up to like 25% of server market share... Briefly.  They would love to get that back, and maybe they will. But I don't see a scenario where they get 50%+ anytime soon. They have the best chance at holding that market share in the consumer market long term and they're stupid if they fuck it up again. 

Let me put this another way:  Every few years one of the companies gets a technology lead. Then they other company comes back with something better. Intel usually holds the lead much longer than AMD can. I don't understand why you all think that that cycle is going to break this time and the smaller weaker company is going to be the one to pull off some amazing dominance for the long term.

&gt; A price target is the projected price level of a financial security stated by an investment analyst or adviser and includes **assumptions of future activity**. It represents a security's price that, if achieved, results in a trader recognizing the best possible outcome for his investment. 

And that $30 price target, that's not the consenus.  That's the outlier.  Look here for more analyst's ratings:  [https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/amd/analyst-research](https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/amd/analyst-research)

See, that's the thing.  Intel gets complacent when AMD goes years without a competitive product.  Why bother spending all that time and effort when you can just sit back and make money off of your old shit when you have no competition?  It's a strategic decision.

We've seen all this before.  AMD was the first to 1GHz because Intel cornered the market and got lazy.  AMD was the first to 64-bit x86 chips because Intel thought they could get away with switching the whole world over to Itanium.  If I remember right, AMD was the first to dual-core CPUs too.  AMD has a history of really making great stuff with a tiny fraction of Intel's budget and manpower... but they are never able to keep it for long.

In every case, Intel got caught totally by surprise.  Then they came back and eventually destroyed AMD with both superior products, massive marketing, and illegal anti-trust stuff.  Intel is careful not to force them completely out of business because then they'd be a monopoly, otherwise we wouldn't even be having this conversation.

People keep talking about the fabrication process that is going to be the game-changer for AMD this time around.  Does the retarded guy in the trailer next to you care about that when shopping for a porn box?  I've been a disappointed AMD fanboy for years and jumped on the first wave every time they make some cool ground breaking advancement, then I'd bang my head against the wall as everyone still just buys whatever stuff Intel is making and paying more money for it.

Maybe people are finally savvy enough about this stuff now that they'll actually start sticking to AMD stuff once Intel comes back with whatever their answer is going to be.  I'm not so sure.",Tr47gRKl5,wallstreetbets,250.0

8,2018-09-11,"Well IBM has done some interesting things to get down to 3nm, but it's not likely to be commercially viable (it uses the same EUV tech Intel is struggling with at 10nm). 

The other route is quantum computing, which uses a trinary approach to computing (on, off, and indeterminate...think Schrodinger's Bit). The problem is there are very few use cases where quantum computing has an advantage over really fast binary computing. 

Right now, we're seeing things change in the tech space in ways as fundamental as when the semiconductor was introduced. Moore's Law is on the life support of increasing core count. Before you know it the average laptop will have 16 cores and enthusiast platforms make Phi chips look like pikers. Then it will truly die as it runs up on Amadahls Law. Once that happens, we will be at a standstill until something revolutionizes how we do computing. 

I'm long AMD because they have the better engineering model to thrive in a Moore meets Amadahl world. In terms of growth after that...it's going to get interesting. We need fundamental breakthroughs to keep advancing. ",tdavis25,wallstreetbets,8.0

The craziest thing about AMD being given this opportunity to steal so much market share from intel is that they have a a CEO that knows how to run a company well and isn't just a bean counter or just an engineer. More importantly intel will inevitably be able to come back from this in a few years but the total market will just continue to grow.

We don't have pricing information yet but I predict what we'll see is similar to the existing structure, where most user scenarios will see maximum performance on intel but at a significant price premium to the AMD chip, and heavily threaded applications performing better on more cores.

115,2018-09-11,"they are going to announce that they bought back at least 3-4 billion worth of shares, with hopefully good numbers. Market sentiment dwarfs all so we'll see what happens, but this is getting ridiculous. 

50 bil company with 12~+ bil in profits/yr. A buyback of 10 bil and possibly higher with how much this is dropping. 

We're going to be looking at a 3.8~ p/e after this q's buyback and a forward and roughly the same amount. 

Arguments were made that instead of an eps of ~11, we could be seeing in a few years, or in the nearer future, because of memory pricing collapse, eps of 7~ or 6. 

Now, I think it's pretty clear to a rational person that the environment is much different, although there are a few other issues like trade war, but most importantly china ramp of memory that will eventually happen many years from now. But these worries are also offset by emergence of memory in av that will come. The ecosystem will be different, but regardless of its outcome, the rational worst case is something like 6 eps considering the 10 bil buyback among more that will come, imo. 

Now, even at a potential 6 eps, at the worst case, we're looking at a a pe of 7.5...This is too far low for any company, especially if the worst is to occur. 7.5 is pricing in the worst, that has yet to come. This is clearly wrong and the clearest of buying opportunity. Something closer to 12~ is more reasonable, if not still a bit too low. 72~ brings out that 12 pe. and this is again, imo, if the worst case occurs, it should result in 72. This has gone beyond ridiculous. A company that is pumping mother fucking 14~ billion with a fucking b PROFITS. There's no rational behind the idea that it'll collapse so fast that it will be making only 4 billion in profits. This in insanity to me. I feel bad for those like marty who've been losing a lot because of this bs. Same shit happened with amd, same thing will happen with mu.

&gt; Advanced Micro Device (AMD) is a great example of a semiconductor stock that went up quickly, like what we are hoping Micron will do. On April 2nd, 2018, about six months ago, the stock was trading at $9.53 cents. Since then, it has gone up over $20 dollars to trade at $29.89...
&gt; That is a 3x increase in the past six months, on expectations that earnings will rise in the future, since it's forward P/E ration is now at 60! Micron's earnings have already increased substantially, so let's hope the market gives Micron the same love it has given AMD lately.

208,2018-09-12,"Bubbles primarily occur when momentum is carrying something beyond what the fundamentals justify. Frankly I only put 30% of my account in AMD and the position has grown to beyond 50%. Its just screaming so much faster than the rest of the market.

But on fundamentals: the thing to understand here is were seeing a secular shift in the processor space. For the first time AMD has leads in basically every area but IPC. Density, efficiency, price...all are better on AMD than Intel. AMD is also about to leapfrog Intel on process node and Intel, with their delayed 10nm, wont catch up until late 2019. With that we very well may see an IPC win for AMD as well. 

Look, AMD is saying they hope to hit double-digit penetration (so 10%) of the datacenter market by 2h 2019. Intel hopes they can ***contain*** AMD at 20%. Taking the middle of that road you have AMD doubling their revenue with 60% margin product while Intel looses a big chunk of their biggest margin area and are forced to start competing on price.

And here is the all-time kicker: AMD's design approach is much much much more efficient from a manufacturing perspective. I cant do nearly as good of a job of explaining it as Jim at AdoredTV (www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucMQermB9wQ). Bottom line, AMD is going to be better positioned because of the design of Ryzen/Epyc to compete on cost than Intel with their monolithic core designs. They will also be able to be financially profitable at lower process nodes than Intel can possibly manage at the same core counts.

Intel needs a massive change in how it approaches CPU design or they will start falling way behind AMD. They already are behind on all the key metrics for datacenter, and AMD is about to release their 2nd generation of that product which will be even better.

With AMD fundamentally outpacing Intel they will take market share by the truckload, and have all of the revenue and profitability benefits that come with that.",tdavis25,wallstreetbets,208.0

I don't know how they relate- I haven't studied this particular phenomenon yet, in regards to investor feelings.

However as an IT engineer, I would propose the negativity is in response to the fact that the 7nm architecture has not been attainable, even INTC pulled back to 10nm, and AMD currently uses 12nm. The leak indicates ""constant crashing"" right now, so it could be that they're investing into something that others deem is a failing investment path, as proven by other efforts by other groups.

I think it's tough to predict what will happen at AMD's next ER since, IMO, the action that got AMD over $20 has been things that will happen next year, so my guess is beat EPS and raise guidance and it should hold steady, but the last few days have shaken me of that belief; it may be a solid beat and only drops 5%, or not and drops 15%.",Gahvynn,wallstreetbets,285.0

All the while AMD reporting their roadmap was on track if not a bit accelerated.  So a behemoth saying it was going to have a tough time for a year or more and the only real competitor basically saying ‘we good’ and soaking up whatever Intel couldn’t supply is definitely a bit of difference from $9 to now.

All the Intel letter did was admit they are behind and are going to spend big in CapEx to try to catch up. That 1B is going to their books, margin, or product cost. They also admit to a 4Q timeframe to spin up supply. 

They have told us AMD has 4Q to steal market share and timelines tell us AMD will have the 7nm chip out before INTL can release a 10nm chip. 

I'm still confused how no one sees this problem that the giant INTL can't accurately keep up with demand, and cant keep pace with the little overpriced AMD on innovation.

The stock prices of Intel vs AMD in the last few days after just one tiny bit of halfway decent news in Intel's favor is likely a taste of what's coming.

I'm saying that you need to recognize that the risk involved with a long AMD strategy is related to the risk of Intel just staying where they are. There more to it than how awesome AMD's chips are right now and if they sell a bunch of stuff for a few quarters. Like it or not, the market sees it as Intel's game to lose and AMD stock ain't going to moon unless Intel takes a giant shit.

I think this makes sense anyways. Might be better ways as well, and you do lose some gains in this.

189,2018-10-03,"Intel is a POS company that fails to innovate and gimps consumers with overpriced and shitty products. Their 10nm bring pushed up doesn't mean anything because AMD already has their 7nm ready. AMD's 7nm chips were reportly leaked and had quite a performance gain, with 4ghz base and 4.5ghz boost. Overclocking it to 4.9-5ghz is definitely a possibility and not only that, they might introduce a 10 core / 20 thread Ryzen 7 processor as a top of the line mainstream CPU. What I'm hoping is for AMD to release it soon or before the holiday season.

I have a feeling they might release it soon since Intel is pretty much bringing another 14nm refresh 9000 series CPU. Su Bae won't let it happen. The market reaction to all of this is bullshit and we'll be back to $32 in a week or two. Long $AMD",cloudninexo,wallstreetbets,189.0

268,2018-10-03,You kind of just have to pay attention to what's going on.  I'm a big computer guy so when Ryzen initially launched in early 2017 I saw the benchmarks and saw for the first time in awhile AMD had created something that not only went head to head with Intel they had a produce that in many ways beat it. So I put some money into the AMD then at around $11 per share.  Since then AMD has continued on the success of Ryzen with the gen2 chips and the threadripper chips have build successful as well.  I'm still not off AMD yet.  If they successfully launch 7nm chips by years end I think they'll go up again.  Or you can invest in memes. ,JTR616,wallstreetbets,268.0

2,2018-10-06," Especially if you're a new investor and you're putting a significant portion of your portfolio into this, I would wait until after legalization. If it drops, it's going to fall like a rock. If it rises, it's only going to go up a couple % a day so you'll have time to jump in. Be patient with your entry point. Once you see some upwards momentum after legalization, jump in and set a stop loss somewhere close to your fill price for your buy order. If it keeps rising fast and you really don't want to take any chances, you can set your stop loss to your fill price once the market price is well above that. If you're in it for the long term I wouldn't set a limit price for your sell order, just a stop loss that's GTC (Good Til Cancelled). Worst case you hit your stop loss and you lose some money to commissions and the market order placement for your stop loss. Best case you wait it out until you're happy with the amount of profit you've made. Keep moving your stop loss up manually every week/ 2 weeks. You'll be losing some money to commission but it's worth the peace of mind and reduced risk. Every time you move it keep thinking of an exit point for the stock. Are earnings still good? Is there any long term bad news about CGC? Do you personally think the stock is going to keep going up? Every time you move your stop loss think about how much further you think the stock is going to go and start making plans to put a stop limit order in. As long as you're following the stock and moving your stop losses, there's little risk of losing money.  

Also to anyone reading this who knows about trailing limits and is going to laugh at me, I personally don't like them because stocks can have huge fluctuations and later huge corrections. Percentage losses don't mean nearly as much as breaking of a well established support level. The market can overreact to news and correct itself quickly, but if that news sends it fast a support level it can quickly spiral out of control. AMD breaking through 30 is a great example of this.",hapticdash,wallstreetbets,2.0
3,2018-10-06,"Dog sitting for my parents for the dog I got in college and my parents fell in love with, so I gifted him to them. So I’m at my favorite local bar from my younger days that changed hands since I’ve been here last. Waiting on wings and chicken and waffles drinking a good local beer by myself on the back porch on a cool early fall evening. It’s a nice trip down memory lane, and a good decompress from the week. 


Avoided most of the blood this week, basically broke even thanks to selling my GE puts accurately, but a couple of retarded SNAP and AMD FD’s brought me down the tendies my GE puts got me. 


So I’m just gonna enjoy the weekend and spend some time with myself and my old friend Odie. Might get a haircut and get some nice steak to grill tomorrow, maybe hit the old skatepark and shred some bowls for old times sake. It should be a nice weekend. 

Edit: update: wings are excellent still. 

Edit 2: chicken and waffles is literally a pile of extra crispy tendies over waffles. Super dank.

On top of this, the whole run up to 32 was completely hype driven, so after seeing some hard numbers people will start thinking that the hype may not have been justified. I just can't imagine them growing so much that it causes another bull run. People forget that INTC is still the bigger company. 7nm is great news for the future, but in the short term the numbers will remind people that AMD can't make a huge dent in Intel's profits just yet.

34,2018-10-07,"Sure..I dont remember all of the expirations though but heres what I learned. 1: Don't be a bitch and panic sell. The biggest loss on that chart were from AMD puts on the day it went to 34. I bought the previous day and decided to cut my losses.. Those woulda put me passed 20k if I held. Losses dont hurt as bad as missed gains which made me irrational. Don't do that
2: Don't put ur entire account on one trade.. 
3: Don't chase losses. After the AMD puts fell off I bought amzn 1950 calls. That next morning it went to 1930 after 3 consecutive red days, which brings me back to rule one. It makes sense to cut ur losses but in reality all of my losses came from panic selling and then chasing losses. 
4: After I stopped panic selling, last week happened. hedge ur positions. ",wassupobscurenetwork,wallstreetbets,34.0

I’m just salty I’m still down $6k for the month. Made a shitload off of MJ and CRON last month and lost a lot of it with CRM, AMD and AAPL. 

Also some fucker on here convinced me MSFT was gonna correct a couple weeks back so I sold 10 $111 calls (that were up 15% already) two days before it shot up to like $114. Missed out on 3k profit there. Not only did I sell the calls I bought 20 puts for $110 that expired worthless and lost me $2.5k. &lt;/rant&gt;

Feelsbad.

Eventually. But you can't even use it yet. I'm not saying that ray tracing sucks, but it was released way too soon. They should have spent time optimizing it and getting it to run better, while letting game developers prepare for the release more, so they could release an optimized product, that could be used when you bought it.

At the lofty price it's currently at, the majority of gamers will not be buying an rtx any time soon. Not to mention you can't even buy them right now, they are all out of stock due to supply complications.

31,2018-10-11,"I wouldn't be so sure about that. They are definitely the dominant GPU company, but their most recent release (RTX series) was a *hard* flop. Way too expensive, and the massive price hike was justified by a premium feature that was rushed to market, underperformed, and isn't even usable yet baring a few games. The only people that are buying it are people with a lot of money to blow who absolutely *have* to have the most recent card. And their 'cheap' version of the card (still more expensive than any other consumer card available baring the 1080ti) has been delayed multiple times, and still isn't available. 

Rumors are that AMD has multiple new GPUs up their sleeve (Polaris refresh coming sometime in Q4, and a new 7nm Navi architecture further out), and if they were going to strike the time would be now.

",DeginGambler,wallstreetbets,8.0
9,2018-11-03,"If you buy a call, you're betting that the price is gonna go up. So you can pick a call option that is either ITM (In the money) or OTM (Out of the money) right? 

a ITM call option would be say, AMD is trading at 15$ and you buy a call for 15$ amd. If it goes up at all, you'll make money. If it goes down at all, you'll lose your money. 

And the reverse it true for puts. 

ITM options are more expensive, since you're more guaranteed to make a profit, while OTM options are cheap, cause you have a tiny percentage at actually getting to the strike price of your calls / puts. 

However, for example, I've been buying otm snap puts and calls. I got lucky cause I bought a call right as SNAP started to rally because people thought maybe AMZN or someone would buy them out. So I made a few bucks there. Now I have a bunch of SNAP puts for 11/16 and 11/23 because I can only afford short term OTM option contracts. I'm hoping to sell these contracts at a profit later, hopefully if SNAP tanks like, 20-50 cents.

I was able to double my money with some cheap otm contracts anyways, but it's a huge gamble. There has to be people willing to buy those contracts in the first place etc. 

To expand on what OP did though, he bought a bunch of call contracts for a certain strike price (215$) and AAPL ended up getting close to that strike price. Because it was much closer to the strike price, the contracts he owned were worth way more (Because the chance that you can make money is increased). I'm sure he bought those contracts months away, and paid much less for them. So he sold them today for like, x% gains. Looks to be around 50% or so. 

Since it's definitely a gamble to do plays on earning reports, the mofo just decided to be safe and cash out his AAPL call contracts and shit before the earnings report came out, and it ended up being his saving grace cause if he held, he would be down 5-6 figures.

""Be ready to walk away from a deal."" The main points of the deal probably have been agreed to already. Today's call between the leaders was enough for the GEOTUS to hint at Xi's willingness to make a deal. The cabinet has been tasked to write up a rough draft agreement. Considering that Thanksgiving falls so close to the G-20 summit, the details will need to be hammered out by the 2nd week of November. Trump will have rallies every day till midterms. Listen for what he says off script about the trade negotiations. He'll all but tell you where they are. Consider the man and his needs. He's a winner, and needs to be seen as such. How great will he look at the summit if He and Xi stand together following a palatable agreement? That's the goal. Xi knows that his window to get some semblance of a good deal for China will slam shut if Trump goes to Argentina without an agreement. ""Negotiate from a place of strength.""   


Lefties will downvote the shit out of this. Go back to r/politics. There's a lot of money to be made here.

It's like calling stocks without investing: after you read a newspaper you make a small mental note like ""hmmm... amd will probably do great after this"" and if you are wrong, you wont remember it, but once you are right, you feel like you could have made an easy profit if you just called it for reals. Real portfolio has the problem it also reminds you of your bad calls.

This same affect happens with cheap gambling like lottery and slots - nobody remembers losing few dollars, but even when you are hundreds dollars cold that one 50 dollar spin feels like winning.

Humans are very stupid, as an overall rule. Write it down and do the math, brains lie to you constantly. Seriously you can track the most trivial aspect of your life that has some form of risk management, and just measure how wrong your intution is. It's fucking crazy, and we rely on it all the time.

We are so bad at estimsting things, that it's easier to predict our actions based on our biases and known fallancies, than figuring out what we can predict correctly. Sounds edgy as hell, but maybe it just shows how good our computers and scientific method is predicting - well everything, compared to our biological capabilities.",spysappenmyname,wallstreetbets,7.0

29,2018-11-05,"Whoa, you got all kinds of pissy there, didn't you? Panties got really twisted into a knot.  
And here you are, still lashing out at others for what you're failing to understand. Let's look at the terrible analogy. If I were to go back and tell the chefs ""Someone wants a sandwich"", they'd immediately imagine that there is a customer that has ordered a sandwich. If I were to go back and tell the chefs ""Someone is out here begging for food"", they probably wouldn't immediately associate that person with a customer, they probably wouldn't know what type of food was being requested, etc. In other words (because this was all apparently lost on you and needed to be spelled out neatly), context is king and meaning comes a lot from more than just words. With above, you said that I was begging for a safe space. Is it really all that outlandish to think that someone would hear that and immediately picture someone pleading with others to stop, with someone being overly aggressive and angry, and with someone trying to force others to not do or say something? Yet when we look at this back and forth, we see that I - repeatedly - have said people can do whatever they want and that people can make what jokes they want. That I'll still voice that I disagree with some points being made and that the ol' shtick of endlessly having ""Red = Bad"" shoved in my face at near any sub is getting old, but that people are still free to do it. Did I start out the gate insulting people? (No, but you certainly jumped at the opportunity to do that.) 

And truth be told, I don't agree with you that the banner is supposed to be a caricature of Trump. I never saw it that way, I never even figured that was some sort of inspiration. To me it looks like the cliche ""Wall Street"" type, flashy suit, slicked back hair, Ray Bans, cocky attitude, ""making it rain"", etc. I've seen endless talk here both bashing Trump for his policies and praising him for other policies, both attacking his supporters and saying that there were supporters here. I never saw it as unquestionably pro-Trump or unquestionably against Trump. I saw it reading him day to day and adjusting opinion accordingly. So long story short, no. You're wrong in that I never saw this place as a ""safe space for my ideologies"" because I only ever considered my ideologies on here when someone made a post/comment that directly focused on them. I didn't think of Trump when I was reading about AMD. I didn't think of the Republicans when I saw a meme about Musk. I didn't think about the Democrats when I was reading about Micron. You don't get to just spout out whatever talking point you want and think that it's gospel. 

So try looking back at which of us seemed to get more ""fee-fee"" about all of this. Read back on our little chit chat and see who seemed more emotionally invested. See if I ever said that people **couldn't** praise Democrats. See if I ever said that people weren't allowed to voice their opinion. I only said that this place was best when it didn't become a partisan megaphone, trying its best to suggest how people should vote. (And holy shit did that piss people like you off.)

137,2018-11-06,"Robinhood (FINRA), allows you 3 day trades within a 5 trading day period. I just stay within my limits there, which is nice because it keeps me from being too stupid and blowing gains.

Strategy? It's been a lot of ""momentum"" trading I guess you can say. I believe that every price movement has a correction. If a stock moves up big (on not that great of news, or no news at all), it's potentially overbought and I can play the drawback. If a stock tanks (on not that bad of news, or no news at all), it's potentially oversold, and I can play the recovery. This market is too hard to judge for me to predict anything longer term, so I've just been piling up small wins on TA trades. Shorting tech earnings has been nice while it lasted. Pretty much every big name ER wound up in a sell-off the next day. FB was guaranteed money on that play, but I unfortunately got in a day late due to the day trading rules. I still end up making ~20% on them, but a day earlier would've been more like 80-90.

My latest was 10k worth of 11/9 AMD 29.5C yesterday. They were squeezed hard (-6%) yesterday on no news and the Next Horizon event coming up. So I watched for the bleeding to level off and a small recovery to start, which happened right around 1PM. I was expecting to make a little, like 10%, on the recovery, but happily wound up pulling around 40% return by 3PM, and then I sold to close.

Do they have a good coach, do they have an all star player, how deep is their bench, what was their record last year, are they under salary cap, are they going to trade players? Many things go into setting the line and professionals do this for a living to get money out of you. The same goes for a stock price to a certain degree. I know there are differences and I’ll probably get down voted but you are betting against professionals make no mistake. I lost my shirt a few years ago sports betting and I don’t do it anymore. You won’t win in the long run, unless you put in a lot of time. Like quit your day job kind of time. Sure you’ll get lucky here and there but not long term.I am not better than the average stock investor but I invest for the long haul. Most of my positions are long term cap gains. I hate taxes cause I’m in a high bracket. I do my DD as best I can and put in a good pile of money all at once and add a little bit, rare, and just ride it. I have some side cash that I will be more aggressive on, like AMD, to keep it fun and sane.

YOu will still make good on Shares when things jump too.

Also you will get margin if you put $25,000 into for example TD Ameritrade, you will get $100,000 on margin to spend on Shares.

Imagine now what you will make with $90,000 in Shares of Apple or AMD or etc.. 

Use that money on Shares with margin, not options. You will lose it with options. With shares you can just wait and you won't have to wait if you buy $90,000 of shares right after we have a huge minus Dow down 400-800 points day.

Just wait for the next big red day and then buy in slowly with like $5000 orders of shares at a time very slowly as it drops and buy more if it keeps dropping every other week.  

In 3-5 years you will have $250,000+ depending on which stock you went with and how low you bought it.

Wins for the week:

* SPY long term put closed up %30
* Active SPY option trading was a very slight gain throughout the week.

Losses for the week:

* MTCH calendars got blown out.  This was a substantial loss and I was over confident here.
* AMD straddle was a very slight loss.  Would have been up this morning, but then again most things went down.  This was a failed trade that would have been saved by macro factors so I'm still going to chalk it as a loss.

My loss rate on specific equities is higher than SPY but my wins are substantially higher on single equities too.  I'm doing well with Macro/SPY plays.

30,2018-11-09,"First, this is one of the few real posts in the subreddit. I agree with others about wanting to see some of your bets and/or rationalizing exact call/put figures.

I agree with so much of your thesis. I’d like to add to your positioning on tech: Q4 isn’t going to be pretty. The big guns of AAPL, NVDA, INTC, AMD, AMAT, MU all have issues and/or anticipate a slowdowns moving forward. The larger picture is that we have broke away from Moore’s Law. It’s taking longer than 2 years to reach the next proverbial peg in design/performance. In the case of Intel, we are well behind their original timetable for smaller, more powerful chips. Similar stories for those in the tech/semi fields. On the consumer side, I think we’ve reached a tipping point regarding product pricing (AAPL and NVDA specifically). Less innovation or bang-for-your-buck. Enough product generations of this + rising prices = lower sales.

Tech companies that also provide some form of commerce grab my attention. AMZN, EBAY, SQ.

I have mixed feelings about how to play tech as a whole. I’m not sure if it’s better to go after a tech-centric etf like QQQ (holds a high % of AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, INTC, etc) or target the likes of AMD, AMAT,  NVDA directly. Post-Christmas dates for options look attractive right now.

21,2018-11-12,"Really sad to hear your story man. Glad you called it quits on trading. It is very hazardous to trade advanced derivatives without having a strong knowledge of how to manage risk. 

For the rest of you still trading these options, please know this is not investing. These are not instruments designed to make you money. These are insurance contracts meant to hedge risk. Like all insurance it is priced well above the expected payout. When you are buying naked calls and puts you are doing nothing different than if you took tens of thousands to the casino and bet it all. Most of you would know not to do that. But it seems with derivatives people are giving themselves false justification by claiming they are traders and investors who are engaged in money making activity. But this is wrong. If you want to gamble go to the Casino, at least there you will know that you are gambling and hopefully have the good sense not to see it as some sure thing money making opportunity you should put your life savings into. 

For those who are really young and want to take some risk and live dangerously, stick to just buying the stocks. If you buy stocks like AMD, SQ, TSLA and other growth stocks you are actually investing and have a good chance. The market every day prices in all the info available for you. So each day the prices are fair and give you a good chance to get the 10% or so return they are pricing in each day. Whereas options give you the ability to consistently lose money on these great companies no matter what happens. ",rockin-robby,wallstreetbets,21.0

The sell off in OCT-NOV had nothing to do with trade but with a slowing economy. Chinese PMI is just over 50. Europe is the same.

24,2018-12-04,"See thats my problem. If i hold over night its usually due to me being down a decent amount hoping it will turn around. Or I figure the stock will shoot up the next day. So its hard for me to sell when the market opens because I figure if the stock is going up why is it going to stop at the begining. Plus nothing worse then selling and watching the stock keep going up and having to buy back in at a higher price (even with taking profits)

&amp;#x200B;

For example I got 2 deals right now. I'm down a good amount on my amd puts and down even more on my mu puts  so I didn't close them and take a huge loss in the few hours that I bought them. So if lets say amd turns around and opens a buck or so down tomorrow I would think no I'm not going to close this deal when market opens because I was down 350 at end of the day now if I sell when market opens I might only take a 150 dollar loss. To me that doesn't make sense to hold the option and stress over night what its going to do. Just to go from a 350 dollar loss to a 150 loss. Plus who wants to hold overnight and break even or even worse hold overnight to just take a smaller loss. Ranting but damn these options really piss me off sometimes.

I know it feels nice if you get one right, but it doesnt take much to send a stock soaring especially a company that I think a lot of people are long on. It's not a trade anymore. AMD is a true player in datacenter and in gaming and those are huge markets. Ir looks to me like their new products are catching peoples eye so continued growth maybe not this quarter but eventually, they will hit home runs. Why trade this stock right now? Either own it or don't. It has taken out some key levels of resistance, and still WAY below the high it made like literally a few months ago. If it starts getting upgrades it can go to 30 in now time. Actually most analysts already have a price target of 30 or above so could it go down? yeah, but if analysts think it's worth 30$ they are definitely buying it on this dip. Their business didnt change in one quarter. They are competitive now. Microsoft and Amazon have made big partnerships with AMD recently so theyre definitely doing something right.

57,2018-12-05,"Ehhh, I don't know that it's a correction. They do have a 12 inch fab and an 8 inch fab in China, although after looking it up I'm surprise they've kept so much in Taiwan. It's more the AiB partners - you need motherboards and other PCBs for those chips to be put to use. After a bit more looking, it seems like china is actually only 10% of [total PCB production](http://www.worldstopexports.com/electronic-circuit-component-exports-country/) although my computer part purchases leads me to believe they're a higher fraction when it comes to the products that AMD ultimately depends upon. 

The other thing is that AMD has a beta of like what, three? They could have ball-busting sales and market adoption and still get dragged down by everything else. It's not like they're out of the woods when it comes to their debt levels (although they've been steady for some time now) and Intel's GPU product line might give them a run for their money. They're a stock to watch that's for sure, if only as an indicator of the yolo-millennial presence in the market place. ",All_Work_All_Play,wallstreetbets,57.0

They're poised to take a big bite of Intel's server marketshare, and if the rumors from last night are true regarding Navi, if they can reach those performance targets at the prices rumored on the 3060, 3070 and 3080, that's huge.",Shidell,wallstreetbets,59.0

AMD Ryzen lineup will go against the latest Intel CPUS and the newest Navi RX 3k GPU lineup will go against Nvidias RX cards. [GPU INFO HERE](https://wccftech.com/amd-rx-3080-3070-3060-navi-gpu-specs-prices-leaked-rtx-2070-gtx-1070-gtx-1060-challengers-at-249-199-129/)

&amp;#x200B;

So what is the big deal? The thing is these GPUS and CPUS are half the price of their competitors so mostly probably every retail user will be switching over to AMD parts when building a PC unless they are a diehard NVDA fanboy. Do some DD and go all in on AMD.

I am personally going with AMD 18 JAN 22 calls, the GPUs and CPUs will be officially revealed at CES that starts on 8th Jan and ends 12th Jan.

2,2018-12-09,"RANT!

I come here for stock picks, ideas, laughs, and news. I come here to learn, from success and failure. I would never blame r/wsb for any losses, but I would give props for gains. The reason I wouldn’t blame for losses is because I didn’t do what I was supposed to do — made the wrong play in the wrong way. 

I’d never heard of AMD. I learnt about it here and it’s my favorite stock to play. I’ve made more money on AMD this year than big boy Buffett has made on AAPL this year!

Also, the “I read it so you don’t have to,” and other informational posts like that... fantastic. I learn more from those than a semester of business college. They’re gold. They’re plain and perfect. 

I don’t play the stock market for 3% gains. Fuck that. I wanna make some fat cash. I’ve woken up to -$2000.00 and +$2000.00. Neither phase me anymore. It’s like poker, once you start looking at the chips as money, you’re fucked. You look at chips as leverage, towers of power.

But you also have to know when to hold em and know when to fold em. I’ve taken losses that would have been larger losses had I not sold. I’ve also lost gains in selling too early. 

ANY GAIN IS A WIN 🙏

But you also have to have a goal. Money management.

If Wall Street Bets ever went away, I would be very upset. This is the most non-biased stock market forum that exists. There’s a place for all of the other financial subreddits, but it takes a special person to hang with us. High risk, big dreams. 

One more thing, I’m in California. I get up at 5am because the market opens at 6:30. My job starts at 10am. I’ve done this for 15 years. I haven’t checked lately, this has been my toughest year, but I’ve been making around $20,000/year. It’s a modest amount, but I’ve learnt more than I can learn at a $60,000/year business school. 

One last thing, my pops put all of his savings into some hedge fund in 2007. I think it was like $10,000. Anyway, it took him 4 years to get back to even. 

Anyway, much love and thanks to everyone for their contributions. I read almost every thread every day. 

Don’t change WSB!

11,2018-12-10,"If you sell a call and get assigned, then the person who bought the call owns shares.  They are no longer affected by theta.

For example:

* You sell 1 AMD call at $19 with a premium of $1.25.
* You  make $125 for selling the call.
* Then the person who bought the call exercises and you get assigned, you now lose 100 shares of AMD at the price at the time of assignment.  
* Let's say AMD went up to 20.30 which would make the call + premium 5c in the money (19+1.25=20.25). You now sell your 100 shares of AMD for $19 each or owe your broker $1900 for 100 shares of AMD.

There is no theta decay in that situation.  Now for a different situation that does have theta decay.

* You sell 1 AMD call for $19 with a premium of $1.25
* You make $125 for selling the call.
* The person who bought the call sees AMD go up to $20.30 and the call value increase from $1.25 to $1.52.  They have a profit on the call of $27 (1.52-1.25 = .27 x 100 = $27). 
* Instead of selling the call and taking the cash, they hold onto it for another day in hopes that AMD continues going up.
* AMD instead remains stagnant, at 20.30 into the next day, but the call value had decreased from $1.52 to $1.48.  The change in premium from 1.52 to 1.48 is the theta decay that occurs.  Even though price of AMD remains the same, since it is a day later, the value of the option decreases.",desturel,wallstreetbets,11.0

43,2018-12-10,"The difference between gambling online and gambling on the stonk market is striving for an idea that mathematically beats the market.

Gambling in the traditional sense is stupid because mathematically over time, you will lose money. Whereas in the stonk market, you can make money if youre smart and clever enough. Its the same reason drug dealers will work for less than minimum wage selling weed and take on massive amounts of risk - they see the cartel leaders and mass distributors and think ""hey if i risk my life amd wellbeing for shit pay, maybe I can work my way up and live like them""

The same applies for us. Although statistically, trying to beat the market does not work most of the time, we beat on, boats against the current, in hopes that we arent actually retarded. Plus you get the rush normally associated with gambling, but with the mental satisfaction of it not being an impossible mission

* Try to keep ~15-20% in cash for those special occasions.
* DON'T FUCKING GIVE IN TO FOMO. FEAR OF MISSING OUT. Better to keep your money standing still than trying to chase only to bag hold or panic sell.

How can a company be priced like its about to go out of business when there are tech peers who enjoy larger PE multiples? Its priced like the sales revenue is going to drop by 5 times! Has any analyst explained how they are supposed to lose 80% revenue in the next year? in 2018 MU made 30 billion in revenue. Thats YUGE. thats bigger than NVDA and AMD combined. Thats how crazy stupid the market has gotten. Just seeing MU suffer like this indicates that no, computers do not control the market, it is the Animal spirits that rule the day.
