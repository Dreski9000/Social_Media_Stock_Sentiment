2,2019-01-03,"Not really, most of finance is at some level based on belief.  Why does fiat have value?  Because people believe that it has purchasing power (and government taxes help enforce a reality to that), and when people stop believing in a fiat you get Zimbabwe.  Why does gold have value?  Because it is scarce and shiny and yellow and pretty so people believe it has value and that belief makes it true.  Why do stocks like $GOOG have value – if you look at its actual prospectus it literally has no voting power or other power/association at the company and is only redeemable for a penny! (No exaggeration, totally true, check the prospectus for $GOOG).  Well because this penny effectively has ""GOOGLE"" stamped on it so people collectively believe this penny is worth over 1 thousand dollars, and this belief makes it true.  Why do crypto currencies have value?  Their cryptology and their purposefully designed scarcity help increase their value, but their base value exists only because enough people believe in them either as a currency or a store of value; if all the associated basement-libertarians lost their faith in crypto as the harbinger of their imagined glorious \[Atlas Shrugged future\]([https://www.vice.com/en\_us/article/bn53b3/atlas-mugged-922-v21n10](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bn53b3/atlas-mugged-922-v21n10)) then tomorrow when they woke up none of the crypto currencies would have any value at all.  


As another great example, Brazil saved itself from runaway inflation 30 years ago by just creating a new \[imaginary currency, and giving that currency good PR before making it a real currency and switching to that\]([https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2010/10/04/130329523/how-fake-money-saved-brazil](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2010/10/04/130329523/how-fake-money-saved-brazil)).  Literally: same country, same government printing the same fiat (just with a new name and pictures), but suddenly no more runaway inflation all just by managing perception and changing people's belief in it.  


The market never gives things a ""fair"" value.  Instead the market prices things at what the market will bare and what the market will bear is largely based on the perceptions and beliefs of the people with money to invest (or divest) in said market in proportion to the amount of money they have to invest or divest in it.  There is a lot of big money that believes in certain technical indicators in the stock market and they move their money roughly in accordance with these beliefs, and this practiced/exercised belief makes those technicals that they choose to believe in and act upon roughly true.",UglyNeckBeard,wallstreetbets,2.0

Are your balls big enough to short it to it's historical median PE? How about GOOG, MSFT, TSLA, NVDA, MU, BAC, JPM, V, VZ, T, ...whatever? The variances among them are crazytown -- just as they are for all companies. Further, when you see low PEs is it a value? Literally no one knows. I've seen PEs of 5 go to 2 and sit there for years; I've seen PEs of 65 go to 90 in days; I've seen PEs of 120 go to 170 -- obviously that had to come down right? Wrong, fuck us, it shot up to 180 and sat for weeks...then, fuck us again, 210 for a few months.

I can tell you that I’m actually thinking of long term gains and this year and the next is going to perfect for scooping cheap shares of companies like SQ, AAPL, NVDA, WMT, AMZN, MSFT, GOOG. 

Current entry point is not the bottom for these stocks as we have seen huge swings in both directions. 

Been thinking about this on my way home. Given the current swings, I’m not opening any long term positions except my 45$P Sq March puts.  
Going to do just weekly get in get out calls/puts based on trend and volume. 3 day trade a week on AMZN, QQQ should be fine.

MAGAs will soon fight for cloud dominance. So, whichever gets MU first will get DRAM, NAND and XPoint at cost, which would be a huge advantage if/when memory cycles back. For MAG, this would also cut costs for their devices (and mitigate the issue of Samsung messing with inventories and jacking prices around on them). Imo, AAPL's and GOOG's ERs just showed what happens when phones are &gt;$1k vs &lt;$1k. (Full disclosure: I have many nearly worthless MU puts ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯).     
     
Another way to ensure cloud dominance is to snatch up big data players and keep or put them on your cloud.       
      
Also, making it easy for people to build sites on your infrastructure will be key. Even most devs have a hard time understanding MAG's different cloud products. I think one will acquire and integrate webaite building into their platforms. So, SHOP, WIX, maybe ADBE or even something like ETSY. GOOG could also tie their ads and marketing tools into the web builder.             
     
I think AMZN will continue to acquire retail. AMZN Go is working pretty well, but they need more locations than just Whole Foods, which was a clear indicator of their intentions to go after WMT. The new e-commerce tax laws also encourage investments in brick and mortar -- even if only to act as product staging and warehousing facilities. So, maybe TGT, COST, maybe RAD, ...tbh, idk retail well enough to speculate on good targets. Those are just the ones that stand out at a quick glance.

4,2019-02-05,"If you want some insider DD, GOOG just gave me an offer for a summer internship, and while I'm not quite the dumbest dude out there, I have like, 3 years left in my PhD program, so it means I'm both an active drain on their resources (as I'm on the learning, not producing, grind), and yet years away from being employable. I'm happy for the change of pace for the summer because grinding your gears failing at proper research is exhausting, but this is just to confirm that they hire so many people that they don't have any real plans for. If you talk to 100 GOOG employees, only a tiny fraction will work on a product that has nay relevance to most consumers, the rest are just trying silly shit.

On a more serious note, when your core business model is *this* profitable, you are allowed a *huge* number of misses. You're not wrong, and I'm not kidding, that Google has an absurd number of employees not doing all that much of direct relevance to the company. But it's not *that* crazy an idea. They're working in a field where the next big idea is worth literally billions and billions of dollars. They hire 999 useless schmucks, and just one employee who is crucial at finding  some development that ensures that Google's business model maintains its supremacy, it's well worth it.

So it's genuinely hard to analyze GOOG's workforce. If you look at them in terms of direct output, it's a massively bloated mess. Some business case study from the 90s would tell them to lay of 50% of their employees to cut costs. But it's a really hard market to evaluate. The line between ""true innovation"" and ""bloat"" is almost impossible to tell without hindsight. This is the sort of insight I wouldn't place a lot of value on from the outside, it's just impossible to tell. There is a line between spending enough on employees on a wide range of side projects to keep GOOG on top, and spending too much.

0,2019-03-09,"So I ran over the [Dark Pool buying](https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix?) + [Smart Money Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_money_index) thing I posted [about earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ayv9hm/weekend_discussion_thread_march_810_2019/ei3jky9/). Here's an update with Friday's information. 

My process is this: I look over the list Squeeze Metrics puts out for subscribers that lists unusual dark pool buying or selling activity. If I see a name pop up a couple of times, I cross reference it with the Smart Money Index to see if the broader market confirms. 

I also sometimes check out particular names I'm interested in that don't necessarily pop up on that ""unusual acitvity"" list. SAP was one such catch. Next time I'm going to try and keep my personal/subjective picks on a separate list. 

**Lots of Dark Pool Buying + SMI trending or reversing upwards:**

1. ABB 
2. AMZN
3. BCS
4. C
5. **DWDP** (was on my previous list)
6. IVZ
7. JNUG
8. **MO** (was on my previous list)
8. MOMO (earnings this week)
9. NEM
10. **SAP** (was on my previous list)
10. SOGO
11. SRPT
12. WFC
13. **XOM** (was on my previous list)

Changes from previous list:

- Dark pool buying volume or proportion of buying for FOXA, ITUB, LLY, NKTR, NTNX, ORCL, and TSM dropped off considerably Friday. 

- RIO had an increase in dark pool selling Friday, but Thursday was also its ex-dividend date, so that may have played a role. 

**Lots of Dark Pool Selling + SMI trending or reversing downwards:**

1. BGS
2. DFEN
3. DUST
4. INGN
5. PRS
6. PRA

Notes on this list:

- CQQQ and KWEB have appeared on the ""unusual selling"" list but SMI isn't showing a confirmation. Similarly, INDL (the 3x leveraged India Bull ETF), EWW (Mexico ETF) have all had unusual selling this week, and YINN (3x China bull ETF) and EEM (Emerging Markets ETF) popped up yesterday but again the SMI isn't clear.  

- TSLA likewise has seen heavy dark pool selling these past few days but isn't being confirmed by the SMI. It's notable that before Musk's big announcement about the cheaper model 3, they were however doing lots of buying.

- IAU (gold ETF) has been on the unusual selling list a lot, but SMI isn't confirming and it seems odd that there'd be buying of gold miners and selling of miner bear ETFs at the same time. 

**Broad Sector/Index Notes:**

1. SPY: Increased dark pool buying each of the last three days
2. QQQ: Increased

Other notes:

- Last week/early this week saw lots of selling of small caps and biotech. Friday though saw heavy buying of TNA, the 3x small cap bull etf. IWM and XBI also seem to be trending upwards in regards to proportion (but not aggregate volume) of buying:selling.

- Thursday saw lots of buying in FB and selling of SQQQ. Friday reversed that, with FB seeing lots of dark pool selling and QQQ and TQQQ getting sold. 

- FANG names are mixed. AMZN, BABA, NFLX seem strong. BIDU, FB, NVDA, TSLA, and TWTR seem weak. AAPL and GOOG flat/holding steady. ",FireSail,wallstreetbets,0.0

So you're saying with proper maintenance, a vehicle is NOT able to make a return for it's fleet owner/manager? Instead of being an outright capital outlay? 

Nevermind Tesla, just in general, a company like Waymo... you think that an automobile is best left in a garage sitting because it has a finite number of arbitrary years (Oh, sorry, the suspension...as if that's not part of a general maintenance routine for anything that brings you productivity/income)? 

Your arbitrary definition of 10 years lifespan for a machine (in it's past form, not in the revised EV form, no less) is literally a number in the equation for the profitable autonomous-taxi future. A room full of engineers @ Waymo are ""ROFL""ing. 

(Maybe a fleet vehicle only lasts 2Y in the Bronx! I can't disagree with you there. That's all data. Which some companies have gotten OK at. Esp. the ones that know exactly where you are, all day, every day, like Goog/Waymo)

amzn, at the end of the day, is a retailer. over 70% of their revenue comes from retail. but muh cloud...yeah competition is heating up in that sector as msft and others get their shit together and will eventually force margin compression.

Does a company that relies on over 70% of their revenue from consumer discretion deserve such a ridiculous multiple?

  1. They have a stake in Uber. So, it makes more sense to lease it to them than to Lyft or anyone else.     
  2. They'd get the data (about users, cars, traffic, weather, etc.), and could use it for ads, products, and sercices.     
  3. Less competition while they further improve -- making it even harder for anyone else to catch up.     
  4. Uber could eat the costs of market research and expansion. For example, while the system is learning an area, it needs drivers in the seat. Uber has an army of drivers. GOOG could also offload some costs of the cars and maintenance.    
  5. It would help kill Lyft.

4. You must not be familiar with the Tawain-China relationship. Lol. Try telling Xi that China doesn't own Taiwan. When WWIII happens, it may likely be started by the US backing Taiwan's separation from China.       
         
And, no, you don't have to take the US government's word for anything. [NYT exposed the theft](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/technology/china-micron-chips-theft.html) with plenty of details.        
     
Also, of course Fujian is going to deny it. That's just stupid. Further, UMC accused Micron of stealing a tech that Micron used before UMC ever existed. That's how preposterous that case is. As I said earlier, China hides their IP theft behind their absurdly unfair kangaroo courts. US companies have recognized this and often don't even bother suing blatant IP infringers anymore -- especially because even if the US company miraculously wins a case in China, the Chinese company just shit's down for a week and then resumes operations under a new name.

1,2019-06-05,"I think his point is about the actual stock rights not the underlying company.  Like if you look up the prospectus on $GOOG it says it entitled the holder to nothing associated with the company and is only exchangeable redeemable for 1¢ and has no other intrinsic value or properties (no seriously look it up).  So basically Google sold a bunch of fancy paper pennies with $GOOG stamped on them, and they are now worth over $1000 each.

His rant isn't necessarily on those companies (I mean it is for some of them like UBER), but its more about people buying stocks that don't actually have any intrinsic value or powers over the company – i.e. stock that is not even really a stock just an over-valued penny.

3,2019-06-12,"I base my short term investments and option plays on fake news. I've found that the most reliable. Latest example: antitrust case on FB, GOOG, AMZN. That day everything dropped. So it was obviously a fake drop to companies not associated with the cases, so buy companies that have nothing to do with the news. I chose cloud companies. They all recovered to near all time highs. Another one was TWLO making more shares available. It was 750m worth. Nothing in grand scheme. Drop was fake. I don't blindly buy on news like this. I look at charts and if it dropped substantially below its trading range over the last month or so, it's a good bet it'll recover. My most recent one (the one I'm in now) is CRMs drop from 167 to currently 151. It's from the acquisition of a company that'll make it a lot better. In this case a drop is warranted due to earnings changes and some share dillution. With that said, it hasn't been in 140s forever so unlikely any way but up. Its normal trading range during bad news month in may was 155.

Anyway, to me news and events are best way to get safe bets on stocks. TA works, but I'm not entirely sure there's any basis for it to work. I think the only reason it might work is because it's a self fulfilling prophecy. It's like if TA shows a breakout point is 103.5, then the stock goes higher than 103.5 and it shoots up to 120 in 10minutes. Why do you think that happened? Probably because all the algos and all the TA analysts, and all the news articles written for dumb people said that if price goes above 103.5 then it's a buypoint. So what does everyone do? They buy. So this stuff only works because everyone believes it works. Just my opinion.

As for indicators I use. Mostly volume. Some 50d and 200d moving averages. And I know they say past performance is not indicator of previous performance, but I don't buy that. I look at the last 1-3 months to see how it's been trading, and as long as no different company specific news comes out and earnings aren't soon then it's likely going to trade in a range so I buy low end of range. I almost never buy a stock that hasn't been above my buy price on multiple occasions recently.",Zer033x,wallstreetbets,3.0

4,2019-07-01,"1) You get taxed on total gains overall. So if you make $100 on a trade of X, lose $200 on a second trade of X, then make $500 on a trade of V, then you will pay tax on a total gain of about $400. If they were all short-term, they'll be taxed as normal income in your tax bracket (probably 10-20%).

2) You can write-off $3,000 in losses for a given year. If you lose more than that, you can roll the excess forward. For example, if you lost $4,000 in one year, you can write-off $3,000 in the first year and $1,000 in the second year. Of course, this is TOTAL losses. So if you lost $8,000 in one trade and made $6,000 on another stock, you can only write-off $2,000. You can't write-off the entire $8,000 since it wasn't your total loss.

3) Wash sales: if you sell a stock at a loss and then rebuy it within 31 days, you will not be able to write-off the lss as in the example above. You can get around this by buying a similar stock after selling the first. For example, I suffered a loss on GOOG so I sold it. Then I immediatelly bought GOOGL at the same price, preserving the loss and the position.

Whenever I'm researching a stock and I see it has two tickers that's very fucking annoying. 

Not only should a public company be able to operate with one ticker, as most do, having two tickers is extra work for a potential investor as we have to go dig around to find all the differences between the two share classes.

I noticed Zillow got absolutely destroyed last week during earnings and when Steven Eisman was talking to the press why he is short. Zillow was down -20% in just a week, very bad. 

I thought about maybe buying some Zillow shares, going long at this now cheaper price. But as I started my research I saw Zillow had two tickers, **$Z** and **$ZG**, I decided to pass right there. And I am glad I did. Because Zillow dropped another -6% today. Losers. Get what you deserve.

Say he used this leveraged position to buy a much more \*likely\* option (E.g. a call that MSFT or GOOG would go up at least a $1 within 3 days). Would that be a relatively easy/less risky way to materialize the $50k glitch and cash out? Sure, this option isn't going to be worth a as much, but considering the fact that most the funds are not his to begin with, he can just exercise the call the moment the stock reaches the strike price and immediately find himself $50k richer, right? This is still a gamble of course, but to me it seems not nearly as much of a gamble as what he did. I figure why not fly under the radar with this glitch, cash out the position and move on.

RH still needs to fix this but he totally could have taken advantage of the glitch in a way that neither him nor RH lost and walk away with the winnings while they close that insane margin loophole, right? With this scenario, sure RH probably can't come after him for more than the federally allowed 25% or whatever it is.

TL:DR

&gt;With Robinhood Gold, you can use what's called Margin to trade with increased Buying Power. So I did an instant deposit of 2000 dollars (the minimum required to access Gold Trading), and then I bought 100 shares of AMD for 3,800 or so, with margin. Then I sold an AMD Call Contract with a 2 dollar price strike to get almost all my money back (it's important to find a stock that has Call Options with such low strike prices like Ford, GE, etc). Then I use that money to buy TWO hundred shares of AMD because remember, margin doubles my buying power, then I sell 2 Call Contracts witht he same 2 dollar strike price to get almost all my money back, which is then doubled again thanks to Robinhood's Margin. I repeat this until I am sufficiently leveraged for my Personal Risk Tolerance. Right now, I am at 25x leverage because I had 2000 dollars in Instant Deposits. I then use my increased buying power to maximize my gains.

&gt;Basically Robinhood gave a skilled risk manager a 250 for 1 ratio loan so he can stomp their automated algorithm into the floor and lose it all with 16 hours or so. He purchased shares of stock and then sold calls against it deep in the money at a loss of about $2 per 100 shares. What this did was return the vast majority of his buying power back into his account. So basically he was allowed to keep the shares while also retaining his full buying power. This led to a theory. What if he could do this dozens of times. And oh he did. And blew up his account when he failed to anticipate the direction of Apple. &gt;This statement is for educational purposes only. Do not do this. It is meant as a warning&lt;

&gt;Mr. Pessimist gets a quote on the January $610 call on GOOG and sees the price at bid $5.00 and ask $5.10. He places an order to SELL 1 GOOG January $610 call as a market order. Mr. Bull also places a market order to BUY the very same GOOG option contract. Mr. Pessimist's order immediately gets filled at $5.00 so he receives $500 (remember each option contract covers 100 shares but is priced on a per share basis) in his account for selling the call option. Mr. Bull immediately gets filled at $5.10 and pays $510 for the GOOG January $610 call. The market maker gets the $10 spread.

Therefore, based on what i gathered:

Mr. Retard buys 100 shares of AMD at 35.29 for $3529. Does $2 call sell on these shares and gets $3314.

$2 is apparently the strike price? Or is it the premium?

Anyways somehow RH (Retard Haven) is giving him the value of the (stocks - premium)? And he uses that to market buy and rinse and repeat.

&gt;A call option gives you the right to buy 100 shares of stock. A put option gives you the right to sell 100 shares of stock.

Buying call, you want it to go up so you can het higher valued stock at a lower price (eg $20 put costs $2 per share, stock goes to $50 so you profit 5000-2000-200 = 2800).

Buying put, you want it to go down so you can sell x shares that you don’t currently have (eg 2011 $40 put contract that costs $2 per share, goes down from $50 to $20 within time range so you profit 4000-2000-200 = 1800).

&gt;Call and put options simply change who has the ability to exercise the option. Call options give the buyer the choice to buy the commodity, whereas put options give the seller the power. Options differ from normal sales in that they do not occur immediately.

&gt;If the seller of the call owns the underlying stock, then it is called ""writing a covered call.""

&gt;It's January 1st and Mr. Pessimist owns 100 shares of GOOG stock that he bought 5 years ago at $100. The stock is now at $600 but Mr. Pessimist thinks that the price of GOOG is going to stay the same or drop in the next month, but he wants to continue to own the stock for the long term. At the same time, Mr. Bull just read an article on GOOG and thinks GOOG is going to go up $20 in the next few weeks because GOOG is about to have a press release saying they expect their China traffic to be very strong for the year.

&gt;Mr. Pessimist gets a quote on the January $610 call on GOOG and sees the price at bid $5.00 and ask $5.10. He places an order to SELL 1 GOOG January $610 call as a market order. Mr. Bull also places a market order to BUY the very same GOOG option contract. Mr. Pessimist's order immediately gets filled at $5.00 so he receives $500 (remember each option contract covers 100 shares but is priced on a per share basis) in his account for selling the call option. Mr. Bull immediately gets filled at $5.10 and pays $510 for the GOOG January $610 call. The market maker gets the $10 spread.

&gt;Once the trade is made, Mr. Pessimist hopes that GOOG stays below $610 until the third Friday in January. Meanwhile, Mr. Bull is hoping that GOOG closes well above $610 by the third Friday in January. If GOOG closes at $610 or below then the call option will expire worthless and Mr. Pessimist profits the $500 he received for writing / selling the call; and Mr. Bull loses his $510. If GOOG closes at $620, then Mr. Bull would exercise the call option and buy the 100 shares of GOOG from Mr. Pessimist at $610. Mr. Pessimist has now received $500 for writing the call option, but he has also lost $1000 because he had to sell a stock that was worth $620 for $610. Mr. Bull would be happy in that he spent $510, but he made $1000 on the stock because he ended up paying $610 for a stock that was worth $620.

So using all this can someone explain how RH is giving him money to reinvest and leverage to a stupid amount starting from a couple grand.

Even with all this I still don’t get how he’s getting the money to leverage himself more. I mainly don’t get how he arrived at $1.7 million covered calls.

Found in other threads:

if i read correctly you sold calls on top of a long position that you own. so if your options expire ITM you'll basically sell your position and pocket your gains + the options fee.

this is called a covered call position. it's used by people to generate income and/or magnify returns on a bullish position. It's a nice strategy, because the options fee you charged allows you to sell lower than you bought. this is a smart move for your case.

———————-

He sold deep ITM options. If he's holding $1.7m of $AMD covered calls and $AMD goes up $1, his shares increase in value by $1 BUT his shares will still be called away at the strike price he originally sold calls at. And if he tries to buy back those contracts, they will have gone up in value by $1. Net $0 either way.

I think you can use this glitch to continually increase your margin cash but at some point you need to ""cash out"" into something other than deep ITM covered calls, otherwise basically nothing happens.",slimuser98,wallstreetbets,9.0

1,2019-12-12,"We all remember intersting bits from the jobs we had :)

One of my first really good trades was buying $EXPE on a dip after a bad earnings call and holding until next quarter when it popped back up some 17% just as it reverted to mean.

$EXPE and $BKNG are the leaders of this space - duopoly, strong cashflow, massive market.
If you bother to invest in it, you could watch $GOOG and try to establish positions maybe using synthetic longs and shorts (I use LEAPS).
The rationale is a bit obscure, working as the opposite of a catalyst (don’t have a fancy name for that).
On the other hand, if Google does soemthing too disruptive in the travel sector these two are holding their ad spend and depending on season it can affect their EPS one way or another (negative in peak season March-August, positive outside that). It’s not a big enough move to change Google’s earnings (they still sell those clicks to smaller advertisers) but it matters since PPC accounts for 20-30% or more of the online travel websites’ cost per acquisition (CPA).
Since CPA for hotel bookings is easily 50% of gross revenue (which in turn is about 25-35% of the booking value customers pay), you can see the impact on profitability within the quarter (but at the expense of top line). Consequently out of season the big two OTAs will beat earnings when it happens (bad bad stuff like bombs and natural disasters etc) while in season they will miss.
