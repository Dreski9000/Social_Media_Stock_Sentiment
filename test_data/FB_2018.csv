For Second Time, Mgmt Refocuses On Social vs. Media Content; Pricing Still Has Upside

Last night in a Facebook post, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company would

change the newsfeed algorithm to prioritize Social content (posted by Friends) above

Publisher content. Recall, this is the second time that mgmt raised concerns that

Social content was being overwhelmed by Media content—during the first episode,

mgmt was worried that engagement would fall as users were posting less Social

content—when in fact, the opposite happened. As such, mgmt is now saying that

engagement would likely fall as a result of these changes. The obvious take-away is

that ad volume is likely to come under pressure, as mgmt has talked about holding

ad yield constant. Meanwhile, revenue has been disproportionately driven by pricing

(+15%, +24% and +35% in 1Q, 2Q and 3Q y/y, respectively). Our calculation of

FB's US revenue/hour is still trailing GOOG and TWTR's, suggesting potential further

pricing gains are possible, in part, driven by Instagram, which trails FB in ad load, and

by the maturation of the video ad product (perhaps similar to GOOG’s Trueview ads,

where users are forced to watch 5 seconds before they can skip the ad). This also

gives FB a way to remove some of the “fake news” content that has become a risk

for the company long-term. While investors will likely have to wait until earnings on

Jan. 31 for a formal update, we would use weakness as a buying opportunity as this

“event” shows us how powerful and important a platform FB has become for users.

We are still willing the play the long-term monetization upside.",jvphish,wallstreetbets,16.0

Profit doesn't matter, losing money doesn't matter.  Growth matters.

The difference between FB and NFLX and Twtr and Snap is that the former didn't stop growing.  With that said valuations will be all over the place.  When you say Spotify makes no money, neither did FB.  You must think to yourself about the numerous ways that they can make money, now that they have a popular plat form that is GROWING.

Growth trumps all everyone.  Don't fool yourself into fear and doubt people.

I have also done spreads alongside buying the underlying on some blue chips, CSCO, MSFT and BAC. Buying a bull call spread on these, on a dip, with the higher strike being the current price can see 30-100% upside depending on the time and other factors. I don't put any more than 15% of my portfolio in spreads though, just so I don't completely blow up if there's a correction. I am slowly building up from about 5% in spreads during this panic.

I only trade a few stocks.. MSFT, FB, INTC, bigger names. Most day traders like very volatile stocks, I'm the opposite. More volatility just means higher chances of my stop loss getting filled.

I usually make my decision on what my trade of the day is around 8:30 AM or so and place my trade at the open, set my stop loss immediately after and just watch and see how it develops throughout the day. 

As soon as I saw FB pre market action up 5 pts I knew immediately that was a easy short, placed the trade at 9:30, closed it for a profit around 11:00, I'm done for the day

Unless you're trying to say you're doing this professionally on a Schedule C for business income,  or even a schedule E if you are wise and run it through an entity,   then by all means good luck with expensing that 40 bucks. 

Assuming you're in the 25 percent tax bracket you're paying probably a marginal tax rate of 15 to 20 percent anyway,  so that's what,  7 to 10 bucks of actual tax liability?  

You can get complex tax returns filed through a number of avenues,  yuh, the 70 buck fee for ""free"" turbotax, if you've got credit karma they might hook you up,  if your credit card has a partnership with hr block or some shit they might want your data that FB already gave away,  but you save the 70 bucks that way.

1,2018-05-09,"I mean...I don't know how quick you want things to happen? This company went from 200m @ IPO to 10bn rev in 6yr, which is the fastest company in history save for GOOGL (5yr). Tied with FB. Beats AMZN (7 I think), BABA, MSFT (all those around 8-9)  They grew in revenue as fast as a dude who monetized half the world in ~8 years (our man zuck)

I'll only defend myself with some food for thought. I'll re-hash these points once in awhile, I can't help it.

Profit point has been hit for auto mfg for a couple years, but everything else has been capex and R&amp;D which, in mfg is huge -- (TSLA is the only mfg example of the aforementioned tech platforms...mfg has high capex and tech has R&amp;D. Double whammy of expensive thangs) 

They are hyperspending while other auto mfgs are avoiding the elephant by putting half-assed efforts and retaining stale assets. They have to create a tesla-esque-or-better-2025 plant while still showing profit (to please shareholders) on an already razor-thin margin. If they aren't doing the definition of *kicking the can down the road* ...well, godspeed. Added bonus: they're literally paying a dividend to shareholders instead of investing in EV infrastructure. Why? [Because the board &amp; CEO are old as fuck and think short-term politics is a good thing.](https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future-ebook/dp/B00J6YBOFQ). ""Fuck that, I'm retiring in 5 years, funnel money out of the pensions and get me the fuck outta here."" 

(Existing PPOE of a car mfg is a technologically stale asset. To re-adjust for the EV revolution -- which is 100% happening -- is ungodly expensive)

As odd as it sounds, seeking a *profit* on TSLA's balance sheet at this stage is penny-wise, dollar stupid. Much like amazon and most other tech companies, the shit you do in the early stages really fucking pays off later. But much like amzn pre-profit...it was always there, but it was just immediately spent on R&amp;D &amp; infrastructure rather than cash hoarding and dividends (lol)",ValueInvestingIsDead,wallstreetbets,1.0

FB will also think of a way to provide pseudo anonymity.  FB will know it’s you, so they can easily moderate your behavior, threatening you with bans/suspensions.  but maybe they don’t allow your matches to view your profile or don’t all you to match with mutual friends in common

Not a chance. This will take a 20% bounce sometime. If you buy at 19.50, you're going to make money.

When you buy, leave some dry powder to average down once or twice. And plan on holding for at least 3 months, and then any bounce before that will be a gift.

1,2018-06-02,"CEO's don't really do any ""real work"" in a big public company.  Their success comes from surrounding themselves with competent people/leaders to run things and establishing high level company goals.  The CEO just needs to be good at picking the talent needed to accomplish those company goals.

The CEO holds his/her underlings accountable, and if they don't perform to his/her expectations - the underlings get a kick in the ass by CEO or even replaced.

When the CEO isn't performing, he/she gets a kick in the ass by the board of directors - or even replaced.  

When the board of directors don't kick the CEO in the ass when they mess up, the shareholders vote to replace the board of directors.

The concern with Facebook is that Zuckerberg personally controls 60% of the voting power, as a shareholder.  This means that he has voted himself to be the chairman of the board, and appointed himself to be the CEO.  

To be fair, Zuckerberg (as the chairman of the board) has pulled in some fine talent at that level:

- Sheryl Sandberg, Chief Operating Officer.  Former chief of staff for the US treasury department under Clinton.  Former VP of Sales and Operations at Google.

- Marc Andreessen, former CTO of AOL, and many other things.

- Erskine B. Bowles, former Whitehouse Chief of Staff and a lot of senior roles in financial companies.

- Kenneth I. Chenault, former CEO of American Express - among a long list of things on his resume.

- Susan Desmond-Hellmann, former CEO of The Gates Foundation

- Reed Hastings, former CEO and Chairman of Netflix.

- Peter A. Thiel, co-founded Paypal.

- Jeffrey Zients, Director of the National Economic Council for President Obama and Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget.

Zuckerberg is likely deferring his decisions to these folks, and these people are responsible for selecting the next level of executive leadership in FB.  

FB will only be in trouble when these people start to distance themselves (aside from losing public interest in their products/services).",EquivalentSelection,wallstreetbets,1.0

1,2018-06-07,"the severe sell off from $250 in late 2015 was due to a scandal involving shoddy business practices. these practices and individuals responsible have been severed, including the former CEO J Michael Pearson. courts have ruled in Valeant's favor and they've spent very little on litigation as a result. the litigation threats is a big part of what tanked the stock.

so anyway moving forward the company has turned around. institutions have been holding off but that time is ending soon. they're getting back in, as we saw on May 8, yesterday, and today in yuge numbers (today's volume matched Apple and FB). the reason is that the new CEO has completely redesigned the company, and the CFO has done a shitload of god-tier refinancing. it's really catching the institutions eye.

not only that, but the product portfolio is killing it. approvals likely in the near future and existing product sales are growing. two companies they bought a few years back (B+L and Salix) are utterly destroyign their markets.

the one outstanding issue is enormous debt. however, in light of refinancing success this month, this concern has suddenly evaporated. someone with shallow financial understanding of the company will say ""BUT 25B LONG TERM DEBT!"", and while that's correct it's also simply not a risk anymore due to updated projected EBITDA and the market is learning this and reacting to it in real time now and it's going to continue.",2-leet-2-compete,wallstreetbets,1.0

35,2018-06-06,"Being that I am a super introvert, I don't believe my assessment of how the average person views social interaction with respect to an online platform (or otherwise) is particularly useful. What I am fairly sure of is that whatever pleasure people get from having their posts liked should reduce over time due to over exposure to it. Furthermore, I suspect that younger people, by nature of being exposed to it at a younger age, will have their pleasure from it reduced at a more rapid pace than the older generation who had gone more of their lives without experiencing it.

As the older generation of facebook.com's users hit retirement, some will use FB more, but others will think ""holy shit I'm almost dead, wtf did I do with the last 20-30 years of my life?"" and mostly quit FB.

All users will receive reduced pleasure from using FB over time due to over stimulation.

Younger users will hit that over stimulation faster due to experiencing it earlier in their lives.

This is all bad for facebook.com in its current form. FB is ultimately an ads company and ads aren't going away. They will continue to diversify in this space. I also suspect facebook.com will come up with a completely new hook to attract people just as the current form got those dirty like seekers addicted. When I say facebook.com will be completely different, I don't mean they will add a few new features. I mean it will be a completely different experience.

Of all my friends, my computer science friends have the best lives. By far. Not even close.

They solve problems and do interesting work (not always, but can't expect that much straight out of college), the smart ones get paid more than my friends in Investment Banking (same age). They have work life balance, and FB/Google/Microsoft takes good care of you. Whereas GS/BAML/etc doesn't give a flying fuck about you. **Facebook: 50-70 hours, $120-220k. Google: 30-40 hours, $120-220k. IB: 80-100 hours, $80-200k** This is anecdotal, but from what I guess, pretty average. Of course, these are the top of the top of my buddies, there are a lot of garbage finance majors doing shit jobs and CS majors that couldn't pass a tech interview for their life. But I assume you'll be good since you're asking.

If you work in tech, you will have a lot of throwaway money to use on options lol.

1,2018-06-11,"1. Fundamentals

Without going into too much detail, Applied Materials is just a solid company. In the notoriously cyclical semiconductor industry, Applied has posted steady increases in revenue and EPS over the last five years, just about every quarter. The only times that revenue and EPS were flat (Q2\-Q3 2013, Q2\-Q3 2014, Q1 2017), it rebounded with strong growth immediately. The last five quarters (since Q1 2017), the growth has been especially strong. It has the most diverse offering of the semiconductor supply companies, making it more resilient to individual trends. And its customer service business is growing steadily, making up for the intermittent declines in equipment demand. It consistently beats its own guidance. In fact, it has met or exceeded its guidance in each of the last 22 quarters for adjusted EPS. I didn’t even stop at 22 because it didn’t meet expectations before that; I just stopped researching. This company has grown in all business climates. It has good cash flow, low debt, and shows no signs of stopping.

2.  Tech = Good

We all know tech is here to stay. We know this is just the beginning. When Intel’s CEO talked about data being the new oil, and when Applied’s CEO talked about the technological revolution being fueled by semiconductors in the same way the industrial revolution was fueled by oil, they know what they are talking about. It’s not hype. And while MU, AMD, INTC, NVDA, and all the other chip producers and tech suppliers are innovating, they need new equipment and fabs. They need more, faster. And their demand will fuel AMAT. The sky is the limit in tech, and Applied is definitely along for the ride.

3.  AMAT’s leadership and institutional investors believe in the company.

Before MU made it cool, AMAT was buying back shares at a blistering pace. In the last 3 years, AMAT has bought back 230 million shares. As in, close to 25&amp;#37; of its current share total. It still has billions of dollars left on its share repurchase authorization and they are jumping on this opportunity to buy shares cheaply. Since its last earnings report, AMAT has bought back 40 million shares, or about $2 billion worth. Oh, and on top of that, it just doubled its dividend in February. No big deal. And institutions own over 80&amp;#37; of AMAT’s stock. That’s on the high end (AMZN: 58&amp;#37;, NVDA: 66&amp;#37;, APPL: 61&amp;#37;, FB: 74&amp;#37;, MU: 79&amp;#37;). There is lots of faith among the people who know what they are doing.

4.  MU earnings as catalyst.

We all love MU here, and I don’t think it’s a bad idea to stay in MU. But if you want to play MU earnings without suffering the sell\-off and IV crush, AMAT is your play. Twice out of the last four earnings reports, MU has literally stopped an AMAT drop and sent it flying. Just look at the AMAT 1\-year chart and note 6/29/17 and 9/26/17. Before 6/29, AMAT dropped about 8&amp;#37;. Then, after MU reported earnings, AMAT went up 14&amp;#37; over the next few weeks. Before 9/26, AMAT dropped about 5&amp;#37;. Then, after MU reported earnings, AMAT went up 22&amp;#37; in less than a month. This is because as MU succeeds, it raises its capital expenditures. And that it good news for its equipment suppliers. And bigger than that, MU has an off\-cycle earnings date, so it’s our first look at the industry heading into Q3 (AVGO has a very different business model). So if you’re bullish on MU, consider hopping aboard.

5.  We don’t know when the trade war will resolve.

Admittedly, AMAT is sensitive to trade war tensions with China. We don’t know what’s going to happen with that. It might take years. It might take months. Maybe they’ll figure it out soon. I don’t know. What I do know is that when they do figure it out, and come to some deal, all the pressure that pushed AMAT down 10&amp;#37; will lift and it will immediately jump. I want to be there for that. And in the meantime, I’ll take the minor swings of bad news and good news.

Somebody convince me I’m wrong.",originalmuggins,wallstreetbets,1.0
2,2018-06-11,"We can compare them though. Similar to AMZN, which had an extremely high capex up-front and was left ridiculed by P/E-based metrics for years and years until -- well whadya know -- it starts to hit e-commerce escape velocity. Even then, AMZN got margin-lucky with their AWS, which allows them to show a bit of profit and subsidize the retail takeover further. 

They aren't supposedly ""high-tech"" -- they are. Just because you can't tell the difference between the difference between a Ford plant and a TSLA factory ...well, that's on you. And I'm not trying to be a dick, but genuinely...they're different. One is incrementally-added 100Y/O technology, and the other started tabula rasa with the idea that almost all of it *can* be automated.

He told me he was taking a few months off to develop an algorithm that would basically do his trading for him.  The way he described it that it was automated at picking the stock/option, the expiration (if an option), call or put (again, if an option), and then would lock in profit or limit loss if the trade went against him too far and that all he had to do was hit “approve” on the trade once the computer brought it to him.

8,2018-07-02,"Great response and you've hit on a lot of really good points.

The poster above you talks about the huge moat FB, AMZN, and NFLX have. That's all hindsight bias, as you've hinted at in your post. Everyone and their mom tried to make a social media company, and basically failed to gain any traction. Google tried (and failed) at least twice. Microsoft failed multiple times as well. Most of the winning social media companies are country centric. Russia has it's own and so does China, for example.

&gt;For whatever retarded reason, no TV companies, probably due to the prevailing corporate culture not caring about innovation, thought to invest in online services.

Hulu not withstanding, I imagine? Also, I think Hulu seriously screwed the pooch by adding in commercials. Amazon prime is interesting, but doesn't have the friendly UI/UX of Netflix or the integration with TV. 

The one part of your set of posts I do disagree with is 

&gt;And other, bigger, profitable companies take those ideas and slap their logos on them. FFS Tesla made all their plans publicly available.

Now - to be perfectly frank, I'm in no way in a position to drill in on the validity, but [this article](http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2017/05/11/tesla-battery-patents-elon-musks-duplicitous/id=81839/) and [this article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2014/06/16/what-tesla-stands-to-gain-from-sharing-its-patents/#316d4ec5665d) talk a little bit behind the strategy and requirements of using Tesla's technology. In general, [there is quite a bit of skepticism](https://business.financialpost.com/legal-post/tesla-motors-inc-patents-warning) regarding the open patent approach. 

I think it's pretty brilliant and does a lot to continue to cultivate Elon Musks' cult of personality persona that's driving a lot of the fervor behind him and his companies. The licensing of battery technology will be a constant win, especially if you believe that recent articles that say Tesla battery technology is at least 2 years ahead of the competition. ",weakandsensitive,wallstreetbets,8.0
9,2018-07-02,"Why hasn't anyone disrupted FB's market share? Plenty of websites have tried but there's a few things stopping them: 1) FB just buys potentially disrupting technology or technology that sustains or improves what they already do. [Here's a list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Facebook). 2) FB sells adspace to literally anyone which is what they got a slap on the wrist for (the fake news issue) at the US congress and the EU meeting. But no one fucking cares so they'll pay lip service to ""reviewing their methods and algorithms"" while making money hand over fist doing the same thing they've been doing for years. 3) FB is integrated into damn near every mobile platform and app there is on both iOS and Android. They are, frankly, THE social media platform and can just buy any competition that pops up or is even the slightest bit threatening.

Amazon is in a similar position as the world's largest online retailer. Sure, Walmart, Target, and others developed online services later, after the fact, but didn't capitalize on it when Amazon was booming in the early 2000s. Now Amazon is, like FB, THE online retailer. They are a household name that everyone goes to buy random shit. Why go to a brick and mortar store or be limited by their inventory (both online or at the store) when I can sit at home in the my underwear, just buy whatever I want, and have it delivered to me? The other big retailers had their chance and missed it. And now Amazon is branching out into other spaces like their virtual services, grocery delivery service (purchasing Whole Foods mostly for the distribution network), and so on.

Netflix I think is the most unique of the ones you mentioned. No one likes commercials, people like to binge shows, and people don't like to be told when they have to watch the show they wanna see. Turns out millions of people will gladly pay 15 bucks a month to not watch ads and be able to binge shows. And their content is extremely varied; far more than cable or network television. They, too, are branching out into other spaces like video game services. And they also throw their money at getting more and more (surprisingly good) content for their platform. EDIT: Couple all that with rising costs of cable, the fact that everyone has complained for decades about ""having hundreds of channels and nothing to watch,"" the ubiquity of the internet, and no one NEEDS cable. So everyone just cuts the cord and goes to Netflix. For whatever retarded reason, no TV companies, probably due to the prevailing corporate culture not caring about innovation, thought to invest in online services. Only now are we starting to see things like ABC online and so forth.

So what does that all mean in the context of Tesla vs Ford, GM, etc.

The big players are in the position big retailers were in in relation to amazon; they SHOULD be able to see the writing on the wall. If Walmart had been quicker to the punch, Amazon might not exist today as we know it. But they dropped the ball. I don't think that the car makers are going to make the same mistake. They already have plans to build on the same technology Tesla uses, they're already profitable, can throw a bunch of money at innovating those technologies, and have the manufacturing and distribution networks in place to deliver those products.

However, it's not a given they will be successful. Those same advantages could be a disadvantage in that these established companies have shareholders and board directors to satisfy. And if the dominant corporate culture doesn't value that kind of innovation, then they, like Walmart, will drop the ball and have to worry about a huge competitor taking away a chunk of their market share. 

It would be smart business to invest a bunch into R&amp;D and undercut Tesla. And Tesla seems to be making it easy for them to do.",wittyname83,wallstreetbets,9.0

TODAY

it's not gud but it's better than the +/-$1k daily swings.  i took some losses on my FB and TSLA puts in the morning but had a slow comeback with the 3 long term plays i bought with the crumbs of my FDs.  i also infused $1k so you'll see the portfolio value went up from yesterday -- but trust, it was not due to gains :)

i took your advice which was largely:

GENERAL

\- stop buying FDs

\- buy at least 2.5+ months in the future

\- buy ITM/ATM

\- consolidate positions

SPECIFIC

\- drump my FB put FDs (wow, glad i did that early)

\- drump my TSLA put FDs

CHANGES

\- sold off $TQQQ calls for profit

\- drumped $FB and $TSLA put FDs

\- purchased $ROKU $43.0C 10/19 (2 contracts)

\- purchased $PYPL $82.5C 10/19 (1 contract)

\- purchased $AAPL $190C 10/19 (1 contract)

you'll notice $SBUX/$F/$GE puts -- i bought these a week or two ago, they just didn't fit on yesterday's screenshot.  pump or drump?

I thought so too; so I took a quick look at [the numbers in their last 10k](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000132680118000009/fb-12312017x10k.htm).  

For the quarter ending Dec 2017, the ARPU for the world ex US, Canada, Europe, and Asia was $1.86/quarter, or $7.44/annualized.  The ARPU growth rate for the quarter is 33%.  Even estimating a 30% growth rate for the next 6 years on the $7.44 gets you an ARPU of $28.38 at the end of that period.  The growth rate for the US and Canada, which has very little user growth, is 36%.

Assuming a margin of 50%, which is consistent with their historical operations, you get income of $14.19 per user.  Assuming they continue to perform well in their other markets (I could see Europe being a problem), I don't think OP's estimates are too far fetched.

I do have some worries about their [most recent filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326801/000132680118000032/fb-03312018x10q.htm) as it shows revenue declines in all of their markets except for Asia.

If my option value is +50%, then barring a market correction and the expiration date, I start looking to sell. If I think there's going to be a bigger drop, like with FB last week, then I'll hold on a little longer. My personal belief is that people lose more money when they get greedy. Likewise, if my option is down to, say, 70% of it's original value, I start looking to sell. It's the opposite of what this sub says, I mean, we love to hold on to our options, but the reality is that we're mostly young and have plenty of time to recover, so we take more risks (which is probably why Robinhood made options available. Gotta make that money.)  Don't take too much advice from me, I'm pretty inexperienced as well and I'm just adapting from what people like, Buffett, Bogle, and Ben Graham have said to options.

23,2018-08-04,"one tricky strat i noticed recently but i havn't done in practice yet (since it's fairly advanced to make a proper decision imo)-  

buy options on companies of the same sector as one having an earnings. you get the benefit of the outcome but less IV premium.  

examples:   
-grubhub earnings came out- buy Yelp instead. grubhub mooned and yelp rose a bunch the same day and next (options up 500%).  
-Lam Research earnings came out- buy AMAT. amat went up 2.5% the next day (options up 300%). Note: MU didn't benefit from this. no ""this is good for MU""  
-FB earnings came out- buy Twitter instead. FB dropped 20% but twitter also tanked 5% (put options up 700%)  

Another strat for poor/pussies-  
Too poor to afford one of those stocks that are 200+ options? Or just too pussy to drop that much but you want to play earnings anyway? Spread is useful here. you can sell an option more OTM and buy an option closer ATM and you can still play with less cost. your winnings will be capped but so will your losses (since you spent less).",isospeedrix,wallstreetbets,23.0

Some real DD: 

Other ad tech companies are floundering and TTD is picking up market share. They are by far the market leader in connected TV and programmatic audio ads - both of which are growing fast.

There is no competition on their tails, and their biggest threat is Facebook, Google, and Appnexus taking market share. FB obviously has its share of issues with advertising, and while they draw lots of ad dollars, they aren't directly analogous to TTD, because FB advertisers can obviously only buy on FB. Google is the king of ad dollars, but that's mostly because they're Google and have massive reach with their publisher network. Their product is a pain to use, and customer service is horrible. 

ATT just bought Appnexus, which could be interesting. They have a solid product for sure, but they have literally been talking about going public for the better half of a decade and they have historically had issues with shady practices.

I would say yes: Insta's growth rate and the fact Zuck is doubling down on it now that squeezing profit out of FB is becoming a bit more difficult. That and PR is shit for FB right now.  


Insta just hit 1B users. Still got another 1B to catch up to FB and hit potential cap.  
Bot engagement still pretty big problem on Insta and continues to be. However that only works in Insta's favor if it's likes only. Since likes pretty much are indistinguishable from real user activity and that's the dopamine that makes the thing run.

Also since Insta business accounts are now taking heavier advantage of the Products feature, I see a lot more B2C commerce to come out of Insta. New funnels being made out of this shit is pretty fun since conversion rates are on their way up.

Obv whether it's a feature or an app, and of course they make it a feature(the whole point is to strengthen the ecosystem, not launch an unrelated product), FB dating is competing with MTCH. Now, whether you think they will be successful, is a different question. Clearly they have some things going for them including phenomenal engineering talent. I expect they will do well internationally where they have a huge position and the market share is less consolidated, and they will not do well in the USA(but they don't need to). That is very often how these things work, ie UberEats using its share to dominate internationally, Grubhub remaining very strong in the USA.

Definitely don't short MTCH, but the dip following this announcement should have hurt their international growth prospects and the drop was justified.

94,2018-08-06,"Look... I'm going to give you a very stupid analysis right now.

There is a singular driver of health care money: Surgery. 

Surgery happens because of dumb organ systems. Dumb systems can be operated on with relative ease. 

Whats a dumb system?

The heart is. and the joints are. pretty much everything except smart systems...

whats a smart system? Well. You have three brains. 

1. Brain brain. Your CNS in your brain, and your spinal cord, to a lesser extent. 

2. Gut brain. Your intestines doin dat work all day to take all the horseshit you guzzle, and turn it into sweet tendies inside of you. They are seriously magical and have magic immunology reservoirs of unicorn value that keep your body protected from invisible demons that make you fat and broken and sick. Eat more fruit and veg. 

3. Your immuno/endocrine brain. This includes your pancreas, thyroid, sexybits, lymph, leuk, kidney-hats, and their respective hormones. They meanmug the fuck out of all the nasties and kill them with fire. They also control how you feel, day to day. Reciprocate respect and you shall be respected. 

Now.. traders often know that biotech and pharma are honeypots but they cant hit the target about how the future will play out in terms of what to invest in... I havent found any MSFT of the biotech world get talked about nearly like TSLA FB and MU do on this sub. 

What I'm telling you is, hospitals make the bank on the surgeries. That market is tapped and largely not driven by recommendation as much as it is it necessity. its inflexible. theres no, 'well, try the surgery and see if you like it!' .. no return policy. people shop surgeons but theres no surgeon to invest in... theres also no insight into investing in the best docs or hospital systems... the market there is hard to tap because of shade/mist in a consistent way for traders, is what im saying. The hospitals will keep making bank for themselves on the surgeries on the dumb systems.
 
But


If you find companies that use pills to support/nurture any of the smart systems, you'll be in a much more transparent market, where you can actually track how many diabetics there are, how many buy which pills, shifts in the market, etc, and folks that find drugs that work for them will invest in that drug for years.

I have 2 8/15 $15 puts. I got in like 2 weeks ago and should have been smart and taken my profits on the dip last week and rebought back in but didn't, fuck it. I'm risking $450 for both of them and with all this hype on snap shitting the bed and everyone loading up on puts, well it makes me a little nervous. 

My thoughts are this. I can close out both positions right now and take a 70 dollar profit, small money but still almost 20% gain. I would then limit my exposure and buy 1-17-2020 $5 puts. You can get these fuckers cheap, right now the premiums are .30!

Using August as a test month, lets say earnings is either the 17th of august or 24th 
So you'd go for an august 31 expiration and an ATM straddle.

http://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com

you can see that the your loss range is if facebook stays within a +/- 5% range, which is narrow compared to what has happened historically.going until the end of the month. So like i said, if fb is known for big swings 10% youd look for an options 
play where you profit on a 3 to 5% range. you can achieve this buy selling short , which i also mentioned.

9,2018-08-09,"Yeah youre right, certain moves have certain %, 

If you really want to get into it, just on the hypothetical side, IV is basically 1 std up or down, so with an IV of 10, you have a 68% probability it will be within this range and 32% outside of this range.

So if youre doing. a neutral play you have a 30% chance of winning approximately. 

Single direction its 13.6%, but the thing is your position can be profitable before expiration, so you factor that probability in as well. which is around another 15 to 17%, which puts it pretty close to 30%.

so as a baseline 33% is a good approximation without going too deep into math.


For instance, this FB trade example with a 10IV, 68% chance it stays within the 10% range for the next 30 days, but we know that the profitable range is anything more than 5% for our position, which is around 34%. So instead you have 65% to win, and 32.5% on a directional play.

this is pretty much in line with the 33% .

31,2018-08-08,"Anecdotal, but as a 28 year-old consultant, I was in the perfect age group to see the rise of $SNAP. It was truly incredible how often and how much people were snapping each other and then adding to their stories. Once IG stories came out, I can safely say that 40% of the folks I follow stopped posting Snaps altogether and views of my stories went down by a similar number. Folks will still snap funny things directly to each other (but less often). IG stories, on the other hand, is now the go-to for random crap to be posted (and views of stories are much larger there). 

My understanding is that the teen generation still uses $SNAP heavily, but I think IG has a broader base. As we all know, most generations are stepping away from Facebook the platform to a certain extent. 

TL:DR; My generation has essentially switched to IG as their main social media platform, and it was my sole thesis when I bought $FB on the dip recently. ",HoosierDadddy,wallstreetbets,31.0

My question is, how would I short TWTR for such a long amount of time? My understanding is that if I use a regular short, I'll have to pay a lot of interest to my broker (how much, actually? I can't short on my current shitty broker). I could use a put option, but as far as I understand with such long term options - and I don't think I could even buy 5 yr expiry options - I would get cucked by time regardless of whether I'm right or wrong. Would I sell covered call options? I think I'm too dumb for this.

If Fb suddenly decided to charge $1.00 per year but offers all these other great features to whatsapp, dont you think people will pay it? Its one of those low cost type of impulse buys.

theres 1bil users on whatsapp , even if only half or so. pay it, thats 500m extra per year.

in terms of cutting cost, they can easily cut dev teams and lean out. How much work does it really take to manage a server?

theyre also sitting on large amounts of cash. Theyre probably going to do more RnD just like google.

Googles strat was to become a common name and most utilized search engine. once they did that they just found other ways to leverage that for other streams of revenue.

fb is pretty much a pilar of the tech space. If youre not on Fb youre on ig. its becomr so ingrained in peoples lives that its part of most peoples daily routine and entertainment.

Think about this, people buy stuff off instagram referrals. What if people could just market their products on instagram without having to have a third party website and receive payments thriugh instagram? the same can be for fb as well.

if that happens you get rid of a portion kijiji , craigslist, ebay, third party party ecommerce websites.

Add to that the high employment rate and new money coming in from people who didn't invest before, and there are easy pickings for anyone more experienced and willing to put in the time and effort. I'm at a fairly basic level compared to most here and have had some stumbles but overall success. I can only imagine what it's like for those of you that have been doing this for years. 

For example, a lot of my FB friends, people who didn't go to college or went for liberal arts degrees are starting to talk about ""investing."" I've tried spreading around what I'm learning to them, but they either don't care to learn and want to put money in M1 or Acorns, or they want to buy ""Kleenex stock,"" or EA/ATVI. Then they don't want to pay attention to it and laugh when I'm F5-ing company sites and stay late at work to review ERs or listen to a conference on my way home. Some people don't want to be helped...

I felt bad at first. But then I realized a lot of them thought even basic math was stupid in school, and don't value learning. Which is how I'm doing alright with very little experience, by immersing myself and learning as much as I can.

Honestly, though, my best investments have been buying and holding AMZN, AAPL, GOOG, FB and SPXL- even better than my options over the last 2 years. I love SPXL and weight it heavily in my non-trading IRA. 

For call spreads you would simply be selling a call lower than the one your buying. Look at the call prices and it makes sense. Being that stocks generally go up, I don’t bet on them going down. 

My one exception is on UXYZ, which I buy and sell continuously. Beta slippage ravages this fund and it pretty much always drops like a rock. Sell call spreads on Trump doing something stupid and buy back when things call down. 

Being that I’ve only been selling options in this bull market, I can’t say exactly what my strategy will be when(not if) the market turns around.

22,2018-09-03,"I didn't really have much of a choice. A living is putting it generously, but I survived.  It was a hobby for a long time but due to medical problems had to stop being a chef.  Canada's  medical system is mediocre at best.  Pretty much had the option of becoming a hustler or being homeless while waiting for diagnosis and treatment.  Still waiting 3 years later. 

Now I've sold all of my things, including my home (3x what I paid for it 3 years ago ;) ) and going to Thailand to pay for proper medical care.  If I'm going to die, I'm going to do somewhere warm for a while.  

It was easy to sell on eBay in the past, but they've made increasingly poor decisions.  They're nickel and diming good sellers, letting the bulk Chinese importers get away with murder.  Constantly changing policies.  The most recent essentially allows anyone to just claim their item isn't as described or didn't arrive and get a full refund.  It's being abused and really hurting the resellers/flippers.  The most telling thing about eBay's future is their sales.

They've been offering random 15-25% off sales to buyers.  eBay is eating the price difference, but reading the feedback from sellers, there is little uptick in sales during these periods.  I noticed none.  

They just can't seem to bring in new buyers, and a lot of the newbies to eBay are massive pains in the ass to deal with.  It shows that eBay isn't clearly communicating how to purchase and behave on their platform/app.

It shows when the only items being displayed to potential buyers are ""promoted listings"" that sellers pay an extra 5-50% on fees to get shown.  They're drowning in listings with nobody looking at them.  The whole thing is pay, pay, pay again for play.

Selling locally is a horrible experience, and I hate it with a passion, but in the past year I've done more and more through Facebook and other apps.

5,2018-09-06,"All of AMZNs dips today were mirrored in most nasdaq stocks representing either a “broad tech sell off” (bullshit) or an overreaction to fears of possible tech regulation due to todays Senate hearing that went extremely poorly for many reasons.  The dip was too coordinated to be result of many money managers, only possibility is Papa Bezos withdrawing some Blue Origin monies which he does every year, that is the only whale large enough to cause the sell off and that is unlikely. If you watched the Senate committee meeting you saw that **it went terribly**, however regulation would never occur because the technological challenges are far too complex to propose any regulation, **AND** this *should* only affect social media sites and the like, where their platform is free because **YOU are the product**, this is absolutely not the case with AMZN. Trade war won’t affect AMZN, it is China-proof. AMZN will never face regulation because the US antitrust laws are put into place to prevent monopolies from being able to unfairly hurt customers, AMZN is most customer focused retailer **ever**, absurd to realistically postulate AMZN tried in antitrust.

TLDR; 
Widespread coordinated tech selloff? Unlikely. 
Overreaction to fear of gov regulation? Very likely, yet very unwarranted. 
Anyone who bought AMZN today got sweet deal. 
Institutions will continue to pour in from China stocks, FANG ETFs will rebalance FB and Netflix (maybe even GOOG?) *into* AMZN and AAPL.

Regulation also shuts out potential competitors because of these costs. Let's not forget that for long-term investors, FB has many avenues under which they branch out and increase revenue. It doesn't have to all ads for them. Facebook Marketplace can easily be another eBay. Facebook can easily turn Messenger into another platform under which one can send money, like Venmo.

They have over $40 billion in the bank and no debt. Yes their reputation is not very good right now but Facebook is still an indispensable piece of modern infrastructure that's not going to go away simply because a few people have decided to say no to social networking. I find it useful for learning about events, for example. 

Google's reputation is much better though but they are subject to the same regulatory risks and are much more expensive. 

Personally, in the worst case scenario, if the government gets serious about it, they will tell Facebook to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp. But Facebook can always build a new photosharing platform and Messenger is already pretty popular. ",beefcake_123,wallstreetbets,37.0

APPL announcement next week, great time to buy calls for the impending runup. 

V, I think I may wait til EOD to buy calls. Historically it looks like when V drops it's a 2 day event before it rebounds, so may even wait until tomorrow.

SQ, it looks like a good time to buy rn, but I'm also hesitant because the stock has been so hot lately this might actually just be signifying the end of its run for a while.

IQ likes to sit around $28. It's at $27 now. A weekly ATM call could be a quick profit.

FB, Twitter, SNAP I'm staying away from these. SNAP seems like it should be lower than it is, I have trouble predicting TWTR movement, and FB is going to stay where it's at until the next ER, but in my opinion that's going to be a huge risk. All in all, there's too much uncertainty in social media with Russian meddling and an upcoming election for me to feel comfortable with these stocks.

MSFT seems like a good buy right now. But it also is coming off an all time high, so I'll probably wait a few days and then see.

LEAPs or shares only bro. Or short term puts. 

I see it going down to $150. Sentiment is extremely negative right now. That said if their next ER shows margin improvement, it will moon, otherwise it's going to languish. Fundamentally it's solid... if you are going long, you better bring your long game with you. 

I don't see regulation being a problem in the near term. No one has ever tried to regulate social media before. 

That said, strategically, it needs to needs to do the following:

1. Monetize Marketplace, it's ripe for turning into another Ebay of sorts. 
2. Simplify Facebook.com and limit how people can share. People love Instagram yet hate Facebook.com. Why? Because the site has become a fucking mess and that alone stresses people out. People may cite privacy but the reality is that people dislike their nitwit friends' meme posts and political rants. People don't want to read news articles full of nitwits' comments next to their best friend's wedding photos. It's too much. That's why people are not checking it as much, it's full of information overload and insanity. They should create several different feeds. 
3. Make events on Facebook even better. No reason why Facebook can't be another Eventbrite. Make it easier to search for events by geography and allow people to pay for tickets on the website or app. 
4. Start by taking privacy more seriously and market it that way. That starts by allowing people to use abbreviations of first names and last names, etc.

Buy long term LEAPS ATM or ITM.  I don't care if you can only buy 3 or 4 contracts.  It's safe, it's still leveraged, and it's very possible to make 20-40% in 6 months.  


Take your 25k, split it up into 8k sections, and buy 3 long term LEAP positions on 3 big companies.  My recommendations are FB, GOOG, AMZN, INTC, NVDA, etc.  Not small cap companies.  Don't buy any option that's less than 8 months out.  Dumb betting if you do.

FB keeps acquiring companies, but we haven't seen much come from all these acquisitions. They could be gearing up for some type of new service or platform. Don't forget that FB paid 3 billion for Oculus VR and already owned an AR company. With the costs of AR/VR headsets declining steadily this could be a play. Perhaps they were buying it to prevent future market threats or maybe they have a strategy to introduce these to the public as a viable means of gaming/communicating.

28,2018-09-10,"To spark some interesting discussion among degenerates who are truly the autists using social media I am copying an opinion written by a professional, feel free to discuss. This was written in March but probably could have been said years ago anyway here it is:

I answered a while back that Facebook isn't cool anymore and nobody really responded to it.  I find it surprising that people haven't gone down the path of figuring out how FB became popular and comparing it other companies' histories and to how the company is structured today.

Not trying to date myself too much but let's just say I first joined facebook in 2007 along with pretty much everyone I knew at the time (aka I was in school).  It might be hard to think back to then but this was a time when people had flip phones, you still paid for texting by the text and calls by the minute, and there was no such thing as cheap, quick, and freely accessible Internet on your phone.  Facebook very quickly became the medium of choice for communication when you weren't face to face with people.  It was amazing. People used it to its full potential like they use texting/iMessage with groups, gossip, pictures, stupid videos, homework, etc. We would spend hours on it per day communicating about everything and anything.  The best thing about it was that adults and parents didn't know or understand it.  Teenagers were being teenagers and college students were being college students on it.  Like it or not, that's what made it popular.  Facebook was used by kids to try to show others how cool they were.  And it worked, which is what helped it become wildly popular. But slowly more people joined it as parents and grandparents decided to see what the fuss ""The Face Book"" was about (sorry some of you) and it started to lose its youthful and ""cool"" appeal as a place for kids starting I'd say very roughly around 2013.  Less and less people used it for important or ""necessary"" communication and you started to see many more ads take space on your feed instead of stuff relevant to an adolescent's social heirarchy. There started to be less comments from your friends on your pictures and more from your Aunt Sue.  And I can promise you, Nobody looks cool with Aunt Sue commenting on the picture of you and your boys with an empty rack of Natty Light...  Now?  It's become a barren wasteland of recipe videos and the same 8 damn people from high school who think they speak for the whole world reposting dopey clickbait videos.  

If you're reading this thinking well yeah, [author] got old and he and all ""his boys"" outgrew Facebook and moved on well I have news for you. You are correct, we did.  But it was the 13-25 cohort that made it popular, just like every. other. social. network.  Can anyone name one of these networks that grew from a base of 45 year olds?  Social networks above all else sell popularity.  Being thought of as hip and young is one of the keys to popularity, end of discussion.  Myspace, Snapchat, Facebook, Tinder, Instagram, YikYak, Tumblr, all of these grew to their popularity because that young age group used them first and grew them.  I even subscribe a significant part of Apple's success to being considered the coolest phone to own for a long time.  (As an aside - Palm, Motorola, and then Blackberry all had this distinction for a while so caveat emptor is my thought on that)

Now do yourself a favor.  Go out and ask someone who is 13-30 if they have a Facebook.  Most will say yes.  But then ask them how much they use it, and then ask how much they used it 7-11 years ago (if they are old enough to have had one back then)  I think many who are reading this and not understanding me will see how much less people use it and how less ""cool"" it is now.  Younger people use Facebook so much less than they did and quite differently than back when it was the next best thing.

Fine you say.  Facebook and I don't need you and your friends who are just sooooo much cooler than the rest of VIC.  We'll just take our profitable company and stacks of cash we'll make and laugh all the way to the bank.  Then I'll show [author] how ""cool"" he and his much poorer friends are while I'm flying my private jet to Davos eating my oatmeal and tapioca.

That might work for a while but in the long term it's a huge mistake.  All the other tech giants have a product that is still resonates with people of all ages.  How valuable will a social network be in 7 years when an entire subgeneration of young adults no longer view this product as relevant, never mind essential?  Growth rates be damned at that point.  Buffett became rich, but he wasn't in the business of selling ""cool""; Facebook sells cool, and you can't sell cool if you aren't.  Kids are all about Snapchat and Instagram nowadays.  10 years ago they were about Facebook.  Time moves on and FB obviously owns Instagram so that's the saving grace for anyone who believes this is a long term long right here.  But keep in mind we are talking about the 5th largest company in the market.  I believe they have a huge way to fall when you start seeing growth and interaction decelerate.  They need to reinvent themselves in order to stay relevant or else both the social and the network part of their social network will deteriorate.  There will always be a place for a company like Facebook and the value they provide, but monitizing Beep's stories is not exactly an inspiring path for this company.  You'll end up with something that resembles a combined Match.com/Craigslist/Myspace/Twitter company at a valuation of a fraction of today's.  That is until the next company comes out with a better and cooler version of a social network and people, starting with the youngsters, migrate to it.  

Cool doesn't last forever and it didn't with Facebook.

Why? Because ~~those two~~ some of the news stories floating around are fake news:

1) The 1.6billion fine from EU. Do you know who the source for that pitiful WSJ story was? Some random internet activist. Nobody was working in Brussels or Ireland on Sunday to issue fines, retards. The rest of the blog spammers just picked up the headline with the number and ran with it without checking officially.

2) ~~The additional services hacked story (Instagram, AirBNB, other services)~~. This story is actually true, picked up from the conference call as pointed out by u/eyesonly_ below.

Headlines like these (even fake) are always bad. But ask yourself, how much worse could things possibly get, news-wise?  Good luck out there!

24,2018-10-02,"To simply summarize, this is a free way to buy FB shares with your downside capped at $145/share and upside capped at $210/share.

I'm relatively new with options, so here are some questions:

1. That seems like a pretty good risk-reward profile. The upside is huge (32%) while downside is capped at only -9% away. It this usually the case, or is this discrepancy largely based on the current sentiment of FB? If you used this strategy for normal cases, what is usually the the difference in upside and downside percentages for a free hedge like this one?
2. Let's say I did exactly your strategy, and Facebook shoots up to $210 this month. I want to exit my position completely, as I've reached maximum profit ($50.55/share). I'm a bit confused at what happens here. Please let me know if this is right: I sell my shares for a $50.75/share profit. I sell my near worthless puts. But then I have to buy back the calls as well for a very expensive price, and my profit would be nowhere near $50.75/share. Are you saying that the only way for me to secure this maximum $50.55/share profit is hope and wait until Jan/21 (or a long time for theta decay) so the calls expire worthless? If so, then this strategy doesn't seem worth it, unless I'm misunderstanding something.

No more options for me.",jabberbyte,wallstreetbets,50.0
51,2018-10-02,"Sure thing- the reason I sell puts is because I want theta working for me, as opposed to it working against me. With long calls, you need the stock to move up to make money. When selling puts, you don’t need the stock to move at all and there is more flexibility.  Additionally, if a stock moves again you, you don’t lose money, except on paper. 

For example using FB (made up numbers):
This is assuming you don’t mind owning FB. 
Stock at $160
Sell 10/5 $150 puts @ $2.50. 
New break even @ $157.50. 
In this scenario you make money unless the stock falls below $157.50. If the stock does fall to $150, you’re technically down $7.50; however you are down less than you would have been if you bought the stock straight up at $160. 

The disadvantage is that you have $15,750 of equity locked up for a return of 1.58%. This is why I look for more volatile stocks, which have higher premiums to offer.  

Now let’s say you buy calls:
Stock at $160
Buy 10/5 $160 puts @ $2.50. 
New break even @ $162.50 ($5.00 higher than selling puts). 
In this scenario you only money if the stock spikes prior to 10/5 or is above $162.50 near expiration so you can sell it. 

The advantage of this strategy is that you do not lock up nearly as much capital as you would when selling cash secured puts. In this example you only have $250/contract locked up vs ~16k in puts. The disadvantage here is that you lose money if the stock doesn’t trade up, which I don’t like. 

I really don’t like buying options period, except to reduce risk in spreads, so I am a little biased in that regard. Ultimately, I like less risk and uncertainty in my trading. 

Hope that helps. ",R4ndomlyJ0n,wallstreetbets,51.0

I’ve been trading since 2010 and this type of stuff doesn’t go away, you get better with risk management and cutting your losses but the type of stuff where you’re trying to time the market perfectly - it just doesn’t happen.

Just look up and down this thread and you’ll see similar comments every single day. Even from my personal experience I can tell you that I’ve had 2 trades, first I bought calls on JPM too early and sold for a 1k loss only to watch them turn around the same fucking day and now they’ve tripled. 2nd I bought FB calls 2 days ago and sold the moment I saw green - literally minutes before FB rallied another 1%. 3rd I bought puts on AAPL yesterday at the top (imagine that) and sold same day for a small profit because I figured it’s fucking AAPL and I should t try and short it.

1. Live below your means ... IE Income != Wealth.

3. Define your time as money and treat it accordingly ... Looking at you Video Games and Netflix.
4. Always improve your home... Both your house and your family. One point was wealthy tend to have tidy houses... Wether as a paid service or as themselves cleaning.
5. Don't give away your wealth... Get your kids independent as fast as possible... Even leverage loans under their name for college or whatever. Shield yourself from their mistakes.
6. Plan end of life care and the for the ""unexpected"" that is really actually expected.
7. Find happiness in your current situation and with your current peers. Social mobility is more of a perception.

1,2018-10-07,Long post which is nice so I feel kinda bad to write a shorter one. But at the end of the day if your going to straddle a stock like FB getting a long term one is more likely to work out then a short one. The major drop off wasn't a correct but just a over reaction by investors which means it can happen for earnings. Feels like tesla where it can go anywhere for any reason why a straddle isn't a bad idea. If I had more cash would go for a long term straddle myself. So good luck on the earnings when it comes up. ,willthewarlock23,wallstreetbets,1.0
2,2018-10-07,"One reason to look at a more expensive straddle is earnings season moves, size and direction of moves, are not predictable based on earnings results. We have all seen stocks even go the opposite direction of earnings beats and misses. So if you guess right about a company's earnings it doesn't mean a one-sided bet is a sure easy profit. Swings and quick reversals happen too - meaning both sides of a straddle pay off. But you're totally right it is more expensive, so only worth it under cheap vol conditions. 

&gt; news is going to keep piling for a good few months

I don't disagree. But the market ignores or forgets news quicker than people do. Stocks often move in the opposite direction of positive or negative news too - especially on tired news that's not surprising to anyone. 

FB's problems are no secret. Things could always get worse and new problems comes to light. 

Some questions I'd think about while deciding on a FB play this month:

-Do traders think it is short term oversold? The company is not bankrupt so at what price is it cheap despite the problems? 

-Have recent events impacted FB profits or forward guidance materially? If yes by how much?

-What is going on with Instagram and Whatsapp?

-How are the international parts of FB's business (which are less exposed to the US noise and arguably hold more potential for growth) doing?

-Trump wildcard: What has the government told Facebook in recent communication and what if anything might the government ask Facebook to change?

I haven't looked into FB expected earnings yet. I know FB is making changes and will probably discuss them on the call. Could be good or bad changes, really hard to predict these things when it comes to social media tech companies and how people will react to changes (remember when FB reported they doubled security employee headcount and added new expenses on security to a level that showed up in profit numbers? how to react to that info? Are they good thing or bad things for the business?) 

I also know it's US election season. And this will probably mean people will be talking about Facebook more than usual because of its role in elections. Seems like the talk will be net negative sentiment about the company. This increase in negative talk could suddenly be *very* bad for the stock. BUT you'd be surprised how often a stock actually goes up when a lot of people are talking about the company even though the talk is not positive. Almost like the market sometimes rewards a company for being important even though it's not loved. 

FB is a huge institutional level stock. Kids on Robinhood with college student size accounts are not swinging the stock price of this $500B company. Huge institutional size trades are needed to move the stock price. Things like sector changes and raw ratios numbers that passive funds trade on can cause significant moves, as can big stop triggers. At the same time, there's a lot of news that little investors care about and think are important that big funds do not care about trading on (remember $EFX?).  

So ya, there are legit reasons to buy puts and legit reasons to buy calls. If cheap enough maybe buy both. Who knows. Probably will stay flat and fuck us all over.

3,2018-10-07,"There were no bullish articles for a while, and only in the last few weeks did they start popping up, i.e., ""FB is so beaten up expect an earnings surprise.""

Honestly, if the latest 50m breach hadn't happened, I believe the trajectory FB was on would have taken it into the high 170's by now.

Speaking of the 50m breach, I believe it's much ado about nothing:

(1) 50m is a small fraction of their overall users

(2) No proprietary data was taken, only stuff that, quite frankly, is publicly available through other channels

(3) It was so benign that security experts didn't even tell people to change their passwords (that's kinda unheard of)

(4) They were on it immediately... facebook thinks they caught it before anything was even done with the data... and their response -- and response time -- was exactly what the EU demanded

I'm asking this because I'd rather buy \*before\* FB starts rallying... FB just moves too fast... just two weeks ago it went from 160 to 172 in just a few days.  (And, just as fast back down to high 150's.)

It's value is in its information, not user data.

They run a fuckin AUCTION based system, with spy-like ad targeting.  You can use A.I. to automatically show your ads to people who are interested in your products.

Even if they didn't get more ad spots...their earnings will still grow bigly because ads are auction based.

They actually sandbag earnings by opening new adspots (on IG, Stories, Whatsapp, etc.).  It actually lowers the CPM of ads(because there are more places to show the ads).

Once there is no more places to show ads..the cost PER ad will rise significantly (and so does their earnings). 

They are keeping ad costs low by opening up new adspots (and sucking in marketers to their system.)

The reason Google Adwords are so expensive is because there is limited ad spots.  FB ads will soar in price too down the road (they've been creeping up, but are still relatively inexpensive).

29,2018-11-01,"I mean, with instagram it's easier to see how you can place adds there. People subscribe to people and channels, and scrolls through their posts. You place ""ads"" there based on what people like see, which often time you aren't even aware are ads. For example, I follow cooking channels, anime channels, etc. And there are always great relevant ads for awesome cookware, Japanese travel destinations, etc. that actually engage me. It doesn't feel intrusive at all.

On the other hand, I use Whatsapp to message people and basically nothing else. If ads pop-up while I try to message people, I would find that to be an inconvenience and I imagine people will just start moving to something else. 

Also, they paid $1 billion for Instagram, not $22 billion.

Lastly, I can't think of a single messaging service that has stuck around/remained popular over a long period of time, let alone be profitable (ICQ, AIM, microsoft messenger, google chats). The popular apps are always in flux. Now we are on FB messenger, snapchat, and whatsapp. We'll see what happens.",nightjar123,wallstreetbets,29.0

70,2018-11-01,"This is not special to Tesla. This is industry wide phenomenon. Take FB, Twitter, goog, Amazon any company in tech. Situation is similar.

As someone who works in this industry, I can tell you that almost alway the reason for shitty security is a PO telling the dev team “lets use this shit perl script with unencrypted connection to an unprotected data store for now, and we can fix this in next sprint” and informing the leadership “everything is on track as I promised. I will deliver this.” 

Product is pushed to production, PO takes his bonus and moves to a new project and the dev team is buried in operational nightmare of running the mess, the smart ones get frustrated and quit, the incompetent ones get fired and the dumb or desperate ones keep the status quo and keep the shit show running in the hope that it will get better. 

Security is something of an afterthought as it is not considered as core expectation from any product. Only when consumers demand this, it will change. 

Just because it is from someone who worked there long ago, does not make it irrelevant: tech debt is a real thing - it can attack at any time and it drags any company, specially when you want to scale out.

0,2018-11-06,"The company behind MoviePass. $19/month membership unlimited movies in theatres. See two movies a month and the pass is worth it to the customer. HMNY wanted to gather data from customers and sell it for profit, much like how Cambridge Analytica made money using FB user data. But every movie seen by a customer means HMNY ended up paying \~$10 each ticket, hence it was hemorrhaging money. It was unable to negotiate better prices with the movie theater chains who have in turn started their own membership programs similar to MoviePass.

It was NOT making money from the customer, let alone even recouping the $19 membership fee. They've now installed a ""2 new movie a month"" rule to curb how many movies customers can watch and hence how much they lose.

Their stock plummetted and HMNY decided to use a reverse stock split to concentrate the share price. e.g. 100 shares at $1 each becomes 1 share worth $100 dollars. I believe it went from $1 a share to $14 and then plummeted again afterward.

Now the company is trying to remain solvent and is thinking about selling off MoviePass.

They may be delisted due to becoming a penny stock.",Kidault,wallstreetbets,0.0
1,2018-11-06,"I’m long the stock so not as close to weeklies/options but I’m pretty confident it should beat earnings fairly easily. Guidance should be positive considering the new product offerings recently. The SendGrid (email marketing and missing piece to Twilio portfolio) acquisition should come in to play later in Q1 or Q2 I believe is financial reporting will remain split for now. Think analysts will raise price targets given all the new developments 

Twilio is the bridge that enables businesses to easily communicate with consumers. This is done through the use of programmable APIs which is a way for one application to interact with other applications 

All of these programmable applications are in the cloud - messaging, voice, video, and now email (SendGrid) acquisition to complete just about every layer of communication 

Twilio Flex is the new programmable cloud contact center. It was made generally available on in late October. It previously was heavily oversubscribed in beta phase. With all of these new products and services Twilio is offering it is really becoming a one stop shop that will be vital for every business 

Main metrics to look out for outside of revenue, eps etc is # active customers, base revenue, dollar based net expansion rate 

Number of active customers should see solid growth. Positive sentiment from customers across many industries 

Dollar based net expansion rate is how much more customers spend/increase usage after initial spending with company. Confident this will be good considering all the new product rollouts 

Base revenue should be fine. Marks &amp; spencer with 640 locations announced it will be using Twilio. Cloud communications platforms are the future and every business will need to move on to one or get left behind 

Some recent news that has not impacted price due to tech getting crushed:

Introduced Global super SIM for IOT developers. Easily create API to deploy IOT devices globally. Partner with T-mobile. Good for long term growth 

Announced Twilio pay: new API that enables developers to easilyprocess payments securely over phone. Stripe is Twilio’s launch partner 

Hired new CFO. Role finally closed. 

Twilio API for WhatsApp now to reach billions of users. Also for FB messenger I believe it has been rolled out. 

Very sad to hear Ron Huddleston, chief partners officer passed away in early October. Very sudden. Was relatively new to firm

Beating guidance is key as tech is already hurting. Although SendGrid acquisition is expensive it has a huge customer base and higher margins. Analysts like synergies. The customer base is diff from Twilio’s so allows for more cross-selling too. Twilio just matching earnings and guidance won’t be enough. It will have to crush which I think it will cause a 10-15% gain 

Twilio’s annual developers conference was in October and the new product offerings didn’t sway price much as tech was tanking. Management will have lot of positives to talk about. Haven’t seen much of an area for concern around losing to other competition etc ",TidyGate1,wallstreetbets,1.0

0,2018-11-06,"Was a different space a few years ago -- Tinder was just starting to catch on. POF did a decent job of transitioning to mobile when the giant shift from web to verticals started happening. They also had just released a really slick iPad app built from the ground up that was leagues above their iOS and Android apps. I don't have an iPad so I don't know what's happening with that these days ~~but it looks like they've moved away from it and back to something similar to their iPhone app... weird~~, looks like it's just been reskinned a bit but never got ported to iPhone. The site did have over 100m users at the time though so $5 a user isn't really outrageous, especially when you look at what something like FB is valued at per user.

Site has been really stagnant since they got bought out, but POF had some really great tech under the hood. Their scam detection was crazyballs sophisticated for the time and their matching algorithms were probably the best in the industry. They had their own ad-bidding platform too that got them really high pay-per-click rates. Not sure if those have kept getting built out or stagnant / switched to something more out-of-the-box now.

They always had a lot of rollover, but it looks like even compared to that there's been a pretty big exodus the past few years. Entire data science team has been replaced, the whole iOS team has turned over, the head product managers from a few years back are working elsewhere, QA team seems to have moved on to different things, database team has been completely replaced as well, guy who managed the APIs is gone. The development has really slowed down. The old owner was a bit of a Maverick that liked to aggressively implement new features, so it looks like the people they've brought in to replace him have been much more cautious -- a lot of that probably comes with the fact that it's not privately owned anymore though.

Strategy? It's been a lot of ""momentum"" trading I guess you can say. I believe that every price movement has a correction. If a stock moves up big (on not that great of news, or no news at all), it's potentially overbought and I can play the drawback. If a stock tanks (on not that bad of news, or no news at all), it's potentially oversold, and I can play the recovery. This market is too hard to judge for me to predict anything longer term, so I've just been piling up small wins on TA trades. Shorting tech earnings has been nice while it lasted. Pretty much every big name ER wound up in a sell-off the next day. FB was guaranteed money on that play, but I unfortunately got in a day late due to the day trading rules. I still end up making ~20% on them, but a day earlier would've been more like 80-90.

My latest was 10k worth of 11/9 AMD 29.5C yesterday. They were squeezed hard (-6%) yesterday on no news and the Next Horizon event coming up. So I watched for the bleeding to level off and a small recovery to start, which happened right around 1PM. I was expecting to make a little, like 10%, on the recovery, but happily wound up pulling around 40% return by 3PM, and then I sold to close. Maybe I should've held for the event today, but I have soft hands. ",tdking3523,wallstreetbets,11.0

* $LYV Q2 earnings put play - first hit was free... executive compensation is out of control in 2017-2018. Not shareholder friendly. Barely profitable. Overpriced concert tickets are the first thing to go in a recession
* $RYAAY pilot strike put play
* $AAPL q2 earnings call - followed daddy Buffett
* $VMW call - heard a tip from a WSB thread and lost my money
* $DBX call - heard a tip from a WSB thread and lost my money

* $TGT q2 earnings play - was undervalued from my calc, mobile app and mobile site traffic was up a shit ton on some dd sites. Figured that their mobile presence would be the thing investors would be looking at in order to compete with $AMZN
* $FB q3 earnings call - lost 90% of my trade. RIP. still extremely bullish but sticking to stock only with this one for now
* $ZG long term put - been looking for a house and the company is shit with tough competitors + going into mortgages/flipping houses

Current play - $NFLX 3/15/19 $290.25 long term put - Overvalued, $DIS will eat it's lunch when it finally comes out. Business model is flawed because it doesn't have the infrastructure like Disney and other studios to pump out and compliment OC

18,2018-11-08,"Facebook's  main platform is not looking too strong but they still have a userbase of basically everyone on the internet, somehow their DAU still increased last quarter(i expected it to drop because facebook is losing in popularity).

They have barely started to monetize instagram and they are going to start with monetizing whatsapp in the coming year. Facebook watch is a pretty good growth opportunity if the shows are executed well. It's a new concept so we will have to wait and see if it actually works.

They have one of the largest virtual reality companies in the market and if that market grows in the next couple years, facebook will have a large stake in the sector.

They have complete dominance over the social media buisness at this moment so if a new trend evolves they will spot it fastest and they can simply create an app for it or buy an upcoming app with their 4B free cash flow just like they did with instagram.

The biggest risk that facebook faces is not the loss of users because these will most likely transfer to a platform also owned by facebook but the biggest risk is that governments start imposing very strict rules.

1,2018-11-13,"I am very optimistic the USA and China will negotiate enough to avoid a trade war. The reality is both sides face a lose lose from a trade war and a win win from a deal. 

The lose lose situation is quite straight forward. Manufacturers will continue diversifying out of China, bond markets will demand higher rates due to the higher risk as GDP falls, and the higher unemployment will reverse wage gains and force higher government welfare spending driving up public debt and getting in the way of their military expansion. For the US a trade war means higher prices on most of everything and also higher rates from the Fed to tame inflation resulting from this crushing stocks, bonds, and home prices due to higher interest rates. This means no re-election chance for Trump. 

The win win of a good deal is also clear. China gets the benefit of economic liberalization of having better access to capital in both the stock and bond markets, they get to keep being a manufacturing powerhouse with all the jobs that come with that. Copyright reform, reduced tech transfers won’t hurt much at all. China now has world leading universities. They can design their own and are much less reliant on tech theft because of their developed talent base. They also have the opportunity to grow their digital economy through IP protections. China also getting say Google and FB only helps their businesses connect with their customers. The USA wins with a China deal no matter what as those manufacturing jobs are not coming back anyways. So any progress made on IP, greater access for American companies, etc, is a win. Things were already really good as China gives America high quality products for super cheap. Now it will be even better. No huge sacrifices needed by China to make a good deal. If Trump pulls off a small win like he did with Mexico, Canada and Europe, he will likely be re-elected by the rust belt. 

So with all that I don’t see what stands in the way of a decent deal. ",rockin-robby,wallstreetbets,1.0

7,2018-12-01,"Let’s try to break this down for you, with your own words:

“FB and all social media’s value is in how well they can advertise to users”

No, it’s in how well they can leverage data. That’s it. Ads aren’t good for selling shit, they’re good for swaying minds.

“Bigger the media platform, more users, more potential revenue”

Growth slowing, user retention falling, meaning “potential revenue” that was priced in at $220 is still priced in. No idea how you think this will help you.

“Cheap and effective ad targeting”

Sort of cheap, effectiveness is only in how effectively the ad campaigns are designed. They offer the keys, they don’t drive.

“The people who wanted to quit already did”

No.


Point is this: a lot of what you’re saying sounds like you read it in an article, and is already tucked into the current value of the stock. You sound convinced already that it’s a great buy, so buy it, my dude.

PS: I’ve been running millions from Lockheed, Deloitte, etc. through Facebook’s ad manager for 3 years. I lead  design the architecture of AI that passively takes user data from social media and vets it for Fortune 100 companies. Its my career. 

The advertising isn’t very effective in conventional terms. That’s not it’s value. The value is in the psychological results, which can be obtained and leveraged through quantitative psychometrics. More money is being spent on “ads” that sway opinion, not ones that flush someone through a sales funnel, which seems to be your idea through how you’re phrasing it.

There will be huge legislation on this in the coming years, due to its effectiveness. I’ll be shocked if there isn’t, this is crazy shit. Huge organizations have been pulling back on their ad spend since early Jan... ironically preceding FB getting fucked twice. 


I’ll quit being a prick, but the reason I mention “AR/VR/AI/Building 8” is that that stuff is pretty much the only set of positive catalysts FB has on the horizon for years to come.

They’ve got the data, so if they can leverage it into a new platform/product, I’m stoked and it’s a good buy. If not... prepare for worse, bc legislation is coming once the usefulness of the tool diminishes.

8,2018-12-01,"Very good points, thanks. Totally agree about the tech market and sentiment. Very true about Netflix, Hulu etc as well. They will put pressure on fb ad pricing.
Just to elaborate further on revenue growth: fb ads costs are still the lowest in industry, only google comes close. As a ""life"" social media platform it just has a lot more user data than the streaming/""non life"" platforms such as streaming companies, and can thus more effectively (read: more cheap) target the end user. I see only amazon potentially coming close in targeting.

15,2018-12-03,"Here's my two cents. I think it's a buy but I'd do a PT of like $180 over a multi-year horizon. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bull-case: More and more ads moving online, 20%+ growth every year, very effective, unmatched reach, deepest trove of user data and understanding, solid ROI, good optionality from WhatsApp and Messenger ads, great financials and FCF margins for years to come. It is a good, growing, asset-light business with secular trends. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bear-case (which is growing day by day):

* Might have passed peak operating leverage on the P&amp;L - now that the risks are being understood, Facebook may need to continual hire moderators and other editorial staff to maintain compliance in a litany of operating environments all over the globe. 
* Usage = higher ARPU. Again, talk to your friends and look at the headlines. There is no one suggesting ANYONE needs to spend more time on their phone. More time = more ads = more dollars. Early innings on understanding just how toxic exposure to SM is to mental health - there is literally tools being given on mobile platforms to make you aware of how much time is being spent. 
* Saturated reach: the top line = ARPU \* users, and users are pretty well close to saturated and that equals one less lever to pull for growth, combined with likely lower usage over time. Which leads to..:
* Pricing is being challenged: Spoke to a CEO of a marketing agency - Facebook (like the mobile / desktop experience) is completely saturated in terms of ad load, reached peak effectiveness, Instagram is ramping and still has room, ROI is really good, plenty of headroom. **I believe Instagram is worth more than Facebook RIGHT NOW.** As good as the ROI is though, Amazon is better AND more transparent in terms of what is successful, behavior right down to placing the order. When the ultimate goals is to sell goods, Amazon is placing a ceiling on pricing. No points spending $70 on a Google Ad to sell a $5 bottle of shampoo. 
* Regulatory Risk: I think this is obvious to everyone, but very difficult to guess what form it'll take. My guess from most likely to least 1) GDPR like regulations on data protections 2) higher liability and clear definition of acceptable content 3) FB gets tagged as a publisher 4) they break the company up. None of these are good and either result is higher Opex, less users, significant uncertainty. 

So yea, Instagram has a nice path of runway, and you probably get 20% growth for FB for a couple years, but then what? What do you pay for a company that has flat EPS of $11 in 2022 (that's the current consensus). Do you pay 20x? Because that's $220 in 2021, or $165 now. That's a pretty high multiple for a flat business, but it would kick up a shit load of cash and has nice margins, etc so maybe that is fair. My view is that they won't have to spend AS aggressively as people think and that the AI tools for moderation will get better and better and that they will be able to grow EPS going forward. You got some long-tail risks from regulation you want to be compensated for (lower multiple), offset by some powerful growth from ad spend moving more and more online. I'd go like 18x $13 in EPS discounted back is around that $180 mark. ",LouisHillberry,wallstreetbets,15.0

I think the major problem is not enough commitment to a position that you solidly held when you made the position. This has happened to me three times, and it's created when you want the gains more than you invest in the research and the positioning. 

I sold PEP 117 calls half a day or so before the stock shot up to 120.

I sold FB calls yesterday, when I really should have held to almost the end of the market day. I would have gained another $2000

I sold MAR 118 calls in the early morning pop yesterday, when I really should have sold them at market close.

I had solid reasons for buying all three. The expiry on all of these calls are long dated. I would stand to make a lot more. But then you can also think about this. And I should think about this. 

&amp;#x200B;

0,2018-12-08,"Dear fellow autist, the gay shit currently afflicting FB is only temporary. However, I admit the gay shit is vast and salient:

1. Scandals every week
2. Poor PR, questionable morals of leadership, and distrust from the public
3. Concerns over growth
4. Entering highly competitive markets and taking huge risks
5. Possibility of government regulation
6. Lil' dick snitches

Undoubtedly, these details appear to be **grade A, government approved, faggotry at work**, but:

1. Scandals are easily forgotten. Simply consider Volksfagen's and Equifag's shenanigans.
2. The poor PR, few scruples, and distrust from the public are slightly concerning. Yet, PR changes daily, [some](https://www.kansascity.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/syndicated-columnists/article222741025.html) argue the questionable morals are good leadership, and there is distrust from the public, but users [still](https://www.statista.com/statistics/408971/number-of-us-facebook-users/) [use](https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/), and those who quit usually come back or switch to Instagram, so fuck those **whiny ass bitches**.
3. Growth is stagnating in the USA. Market saturation is homo-thuggery, but understand they have the [entire market](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/10/24/facts-about-americans-and-facebook/) which positions them for other opportunities and marketing them. The global market has plenty of room to grow even though they are less valuable. Corporate ad spending is projected to increase over the next few years as they shift from TV, and FB will reap many tendies from this alone. Of course, monetization of Instagram and Whatsapp are the strongest arguments for growth. FB's other ventures are hindrances at this point, but one day that might change. Additionally, they have plenty of cash on reserve to buyout the next big thing like they did with instagram. In short, there is growth.
4. FB is going the path of streaming and devices. God save my tendies. There is plenty of competition, but they have the advertising and experience to remain competitive. FB fucking with devices spooks me, but they're not completely retarded, have some of the best engineers, and plenty of money to fuck around. The risks FB takes is one of the reasons it's so valuable and competitive today.
5. Most likely regulation talk in the USA is just talk. The regulators don't even know how FB works [lmao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuPABtlr-rM). With them it's akin to explaining why you can't pause an online game. Furthermore, FB will increase its spending on lobbying if they're not completely retarded. Regulating in the USA is too difficult and often meaningless due to lobby influence on regulators.
6. Cuckerburg won't let snitches slide because no one cucks the Zuck.

",Donald_Trump_2028,wallstreetbets,1.0
2,2018-12-09,"I really like FB and invest in it because of the following:

1) they own the social media space. If something new comes along FB either buys it (what’s app, Instagram, oculus) or kills it (snap). 

2) there are billions of people who have yet to begin their digital lives. As the third world quickly develops they are just starting to get quality access to the internet which makes them hugely underserved markets for social media at this time. As their middle class grows they will be going online and advertisers will flock to those platforms they are easily reached on. 

3) advertising is very quickly shifting to online. It is much cheaper to advertise online per person reached currently and the ads are way more targeted. There is also an ability to control the budget and monitor success of the ad. So tens of billions of dollars previously wasted on old media will shift online to the great benefit of FB and Google. 

4) at these prices FB is a growth stock trading at value stock pricing. You get the best of both worlds, the big cash flows and share buybacks of a value stock, and the huge growth in cash flows like a growth stock. 

5) the scandals are way overblown and nobody cares. Old Media companies talk about this crap simply because FB is taking all their advertising dollars. 

6) FB attracts top talent. They attract and hire tens of thousands of people from all over the world to work there. They have a great ability to innovate and adapt as a result. 

7) given the tougher rules around privacy and concerns about security it is so very expensive and complicated for new competitors to get started. When FB started there was no rules so some kids could make the site with total freedom to just experiment and see what stuck, with legal bullshit slowing them down. Now the time for move fast and break things is over. The internet has matured. This gives FB giant barriers to entry to ward off competitors or at least put them in a position to have to sell out to FB or Google to get this expertise and money for compliance costs. 

8) their huge user base allows FB to quickly and easily launch new products to the masses. Think Instagram TV which is growing so fast. Being part of the FB ecosystem is a massive benefit for scalability. 

9) China will continue to liberalize over time and eventually allow FB. This is a very huge market. When Google and FB get in there it will make them almost as much as the US in the future. ",rockin-robby,wallstreetbets,2.0

4,2018-12-12,"I mean, that's simplifying it, but almost. There was this thing we used to do, called DD. It meant we studied individual stocks, because back in the before time the market didn't move as one. What would happen was you'd start to notice cycles. Some of the best meme stocks became that way, like V, MSFT, AAPL, and AMZN. Shit, even FB at one point. Once you figured out the cycle you wait for the entry point. You see entry point, you buy for 3 months out. Then you wait. 2 months in, you cash in for tendies. This was the extent of long term investing. For short term fun you pick a weekly FD or two and gamble on those, buying on Monday and selling on Thursday. More often than not the conversation on Fridays was around which one had earned the most, since they had all gone up in some way. It was an innocent time, and it made me believe that I was good at this. It turns out any idiot can be good at this when all it does is go up. Then February happened, and made a lot of people realize that this shit don't always go up. I learned some lessons then, but then we pretty much went back to business as usual. This feels different, because of the massive trading channel and the length of time. February was quick and violent, but then we started going up again. This time is more volatile and drawn out, and is actually testing the skills of many an amateur trader, myself included.
