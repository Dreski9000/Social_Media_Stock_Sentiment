18,2022-05-14,"I'm still zoomed in on this small cycle of ETF FTD's, but I've heard: May 24th or June 21st may be potential days shorts cover. Last year on May 24th/25th, we went from $175 to $217, but then June had more FTD's, so did all of last year. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5unFgAie-Y&amp;t=2s&amp;ab_channel=Pi-Fi    - JAJO VS FMAN

Now, if you want to buy calls, on the soonest date(s) that we expect price action may come in, well, typically we should see hedging from 2 x 10% days in a row, in addition to the FTD's due next week. Our gamma max is still $108, we could peak at $113, but if you run with it from $95 theoretically to $108/$113 or so, esp with 2x calls (theoretical, not advice!) that would be a decent move at getting GME exposure soon. Again, it's hard to predict which cycle will hit, but every date that hits or doesn't, gives us more information to work with.

96,2022-05-13,"Almost nothing you said in those two paragraphs is accurate. Its impressive how almost every sentence can be wrong, but you did it. 

&gt;a stock dividend will be issued to current shareholders. This means that rather than receiving a cash bonus for being a supportive holder, GameStop will issue shares.  

Starting with one of the few true things you said. Yes the stock dividend will be issued to current shareholders.  

&gt; So for every share currently DRSd and removed from the market, they will remove the same amount (or more) and give to holders.  

No. The share dividend has nothing to do with the number of DRSed shares, and at no point during this process are shares going to get removed. They will issue a number of new shares based on the 75million share float times the split ratio. If they're issuing 3:1 dividend split, then 225million new shares will be issued.  

&gt;But the MARKET has to provide those shares  

No. Gamestop will provide the new 225million shares to be distributed as a dividend. They're printing brand new shares, not pulling them from the market to redistribute.  

&gt;so they go to the short sellers and say ‚ÄúYo, we need those shares we lent you so we can give them to GME shareholders.‚Äù  

No. Not at all what will happen. Again, they're printing 225million new shares to give to holders.  

&gt; But the short sellers don‚Äôt actually have those shares‚Ä¶ because the naked shorted them and have been swing around synthetics this whole time.  

No. The short sellers will owe their lenders the dividend shares, same as they currently owe the lenders the shares they borrowed. If they were naked shorted, they don't owe anybody the share repayment nor the new dividend. When the split date happens, shorts will owe the lenders additional shares, but they are never forced to cover them immediately, it just gets added to their existing loan balance. If I owed the borrower 1 share worth $90 and then they did the 3:1 dividend split, the next day I would owe the lender 4 shares worth $22.5 each, so still short $90 worth of shares which I can cover whenever I feel like.  


And if you don't believe me (I assume you won't), let's take a look at the TSLA short interest chart when they did their dividend split in 2020:  

https://i.redd.it/fr41cxjll4r81.png  

If anything you said is correct, then this chart should show where a ton of TSLA shorts were forced to cover during the split. But as you can see, they didn't have to cover.",YYqs0C6oFH,wallstreetbets

&gt;20C AMC Jun 17 Expiry
&gt;125C AMD May 20 Expiry (RIP, you are my reminder to not get greedy and do my own research)
&gt;I'm going to try to get a PUT at open with a strike at 392 if I can manage it. Expected low of the day ... 388. It's entirely possible that we moon on the back of TSLA. Everyone hated that TWTR deal. If there's a giant ""Fuck you"" backlash, then it could get ugly.

&gt;GME could do its thing today also out of sheer spite. Bet against GME at your peril.

&gt;SPY High of 404 (why not, market is irrational), 
&gt;SPY Low of 388.

Actual High - 403.18
Actual Low - 396
EOW - 401.23

Week's High 414.80
Week's Low  385.15
Last 30 days - High - 450.01
Last 30 days - Low - 385.15
Account Value - 458.89

Lessons Learned.  For christ's sake, stop playing 0DTE.  This is the third time I've had to tell you.
Also, remember that you make money playing NEAR the money SPY.  Not OTM SPY.  Coulda made bank playing upsy downsie today.",Cloaked42m,wallstreetbets
118,2022-05-13,"Arkk was seeded by Bill Hwang (archegos). Bill and the tiger Cubs and arkk were all long a lot of the same shit and presumably short a lot of the same shit. Credit Suisse's report even acknowledged how close archegos was to a margin call during the gme sneeze.

Pretty sure arkk was a front for a pump and dump on retail. The plan was for tiger cubs (and probably other hedgies, who knows) to take a bunch of hidden leverage with swaps, then have cathie wood go on tour and talk about what a genius she is at picking growth stocks. They'd all continue to add onto their position pushing the growth stocks higher and making cathie look like the Michael Jordan of etf's. As retail piled into Arkk theyd start exiting their positions at enormous profits due to all their leverage.


But the gme sneeze(s) along with viacom's stock sale later on were the straws that broke bill hwang's back, and his position got thrown onto Credit Suisse and his other PB's, who have been unwinding the position. IMO all of these insane 40%+ drops we are seeing on a lot of growth stocks are the Tigers unwinding. Chase Coleman (one of the most prominent tigers, runs ""Tiger Global"") is flailing.

Then when I saw that you bet the house on AMC, and not even a sensible meme stock like GME‚Ä¶ Jesus wept. First of all its not free money, its money you pay back with a fee, and any stocks purchased on margin can be lent out by your broker in order to short the stock. So you actively hurt your stock by buying it on margin and not direct registering. Secondly AMC is a failing business, thats not FUD, look at it objectively, they have nothing of substance going for them unlike GME. Yes shorted meme stocks might pop, but its a good idea to invest in a stock with not laughable fundamentals, that are riding trends and not cashing in on gimmicks, insiders who buy stock instead of dumping it, dont lie about their partnerships and talk a big game without putting their money where their mouth is. Amc has always been a distraction meme stock, face up with your failed bet, work your ass off to pull yourself out of this absurdly idiotic hole you dug yourself in.

In ape-speak, if the value of a share changes too much, too quickly, the market for that share is halted for 5 minutes. 


The ""value"" listed on the big shiny number is determined by the average between the lowest ask and highest bid.

If you have someone trying to sell a share for $110, and the highest bid is $90, the valuation becomes $100, but no one makes a trade because no one is willing to buy or sell for $100.

If no one makes a trade, then the valuation is moot. It only becomes worth that much when a trade actually goes through.

The highest trade for GME yesterday was $108.06. That isn't anything crazy. It was $127.75 on May 4th.

The market was halted for GME yesterday and based on your description, a computer glitch inaccurately displayed a false valuation for .000001 seconds during a time when no one was allowed to trade/orders were temporarily removed from the market.

It is meaningless. Moot. It is a moo point even.

To break it down further in ape speak, pretend you have 100 people in a school room buying and selling GME for, roughly speaking, $110 or so. Then the market halts. 99 people walk out of the room and stop trading for a few minutes. The disabled kid selling for 500k is understandably a bit slow and walks out of the room last. For a brief moment, the lowest available price listed may be 500k, but no one is buying at that price, and no one is even ALLOWED to buy at that price because the school principal said no trading for a few minutes. The other 99 students return to the room and pick a number close to $110 to trade at after discussing with each other for a moment on what is a fair price. The retard in the back continues to scream $500k and everyone continues to ignore him.

Life goes on.

There is nothing that AMC or AA does that is positive, its always lackluster earnings or the execs doing something stupid, that results in more selling or shorting.
